food solutions are well aligned to capitalize on global market dynamics driven by increasing labor scarcity and automation continued urbanization growth in shiptohome food services growing consumer preference for smaller portions and healthier food choices and demand for more sustainable secure packaging our solutions which include highperformance materials equipment and services are designed to preserve nutrition while enhancing food safety 

food applications are largely sold direct to customers by our sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world sales to governments or government contracts are not material to our food segment no single customer or affiliated group of customers represents more than 10 of segment revenue in 2021 

there are other manufacturers of products similar to those produced by food some that operate across multiple regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials 

protective 

protective packaging solutions are utilized across many global markets to protect goods during transit and are especially valuable to ecommerce consumer goods pharmaceutical and medical devices and industrial manufacturing with automated equipment highperformance materials and services our solutions are designed to increase our customers packaging velocity minimize packaging waste reduce labor dependencies and address dimensional weight challenges our product breadth combined with our global scale and reach helps support our customers needs for sustainability performance excellence consistency and reliability of supply wherever they operate around the world 

protective solutions are marketed under sealed air ® brand bubble wrap ® brand autobag ® brand and other highly recognized trade names and product families including bubble wrap ® brand inflatable packaging sealed air ® brand performance shrink films autobag ® brand bagging systems instapak ® polyurethane foam packaging solutions and korrvu ® suspension and retention packaging in addition we provide temperature assurance packaging solutions under the kevothermal™ and tempguard™ brands 

protective solutions are sold through a strategic network of distributors as well as directly to end customers including but not limited to fabricators original equipment manufacturers contract manufacturers logistics partners and ecommercefulfillment operations in 2021 approximately 55 of our protective sales were sold through distributors we generally do not impose annual minimum purchase volume requirements on our distributors product returns from our distributors in 2021 were not material sales to governments or government contracts are not material to our protective segment no single customer or affiliated group of customers represented more than 10 of segment revenue in 2021 

there are other manufacturers of products similar to those produced by protective additionally there are products made using alternative packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are paper packaging expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags and corrugated boxes as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts wood blocking and bracing systems and an assortment of automated packaging and fulfillment systems we believe that some of our direct competition within the protective packaging industry has a less diversified global presence 

we believe that a focus on materials circularity sustainability and automation and equipment offerings will continue to define the direction of the competitive landscape into the future for both segments additionally some of our food and protective competitors have been consolidating in recent years or have been involved in significant merger and acquisition activity and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

raw materials and purchasing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components contract manufactured goods equipment and other direct materials such as inks films and paper our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins as well as paper pulp products raw materials typically represent approximately onethird of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers automated equipment and accessories are designed for ecommerce fulfillment centers industrial and food packaging equipment 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however in some regions we rely on some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes tornados earthquakes or other severe weather events as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies allocation of raw materials and other force majeure events by our suppliers for example throughout 2021 the company experienced supply chain disruptions and sharp raw material price increases resulting from various factors including general inflationary pressure limited availability of certain raw materials global transportation disruptions and natural disasters such as winter storm uri in february 2021 refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional discussion of the impact of 2021 supply chain disruptions and raw material price increases 

some materials used to manufacture our packaging products are sourced from recycled content from our operations or are obtained through our participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global purchasing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of purchasing and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent purchasing practices 

seasonality 

on a consolidated basis there is minimal seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated results of operations typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality historically net sales in our food segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our protective segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season however the extent and timing of our results of operations may be difficult to predict if significant onetime transactions events or nonrecurring charges were to impact our business cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

the impact of raw material price changes and related pricing actions have impacted the timing of when our total net sales and our consolidated results of operations were earned throughout 2021 additionally changes in endconsumer behavior such as an increase in ecommerce sales or temporary social distancing restrictions due to covid19 or other factors have in the past impacted the timing and seasonality of results of operations refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for additional discussion of our 2021 results 

compliance with government regulations 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countriesterritories jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover among other things the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment and standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we have an environmental management system that aids in our management of environmental health and safety matters pertaining to our operations key elements of this environmental management system are implemented throughout our operations we believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance and similar nonus 

laws has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations which ensure safe working conditions for our employees in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us occupational safety and health administration “osha” to date the cost of complying with worker safety requirements and osha compliance and similar nonus laws has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees we have policies in place which guide the company in environmental health and safety matters including training materials conservation communications targets and transparency 

additionally some of sees materials or products will be subject to a tax on certain plastics or plastic components which are currently scheduled to go into effect in 2022 in jurisdictions such as the united states and the united kingdom there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover the impact of plastic taxes from our customers the cost to establish compliance with these evolving tax on plastics or plastics components were not material in 2021 

we maintain programs to comply with the various laws rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countriesterritories in which we operate see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “environmental matters”

 item 1a risk factors tableend

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part i of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

strategic risks 

the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact the health and safety of our employees our business continuity consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic including the outbreak of variants such as delta and omicron and the related containment and mitigation measures that have been put into place across the globe have had and may continue to have adverse impact on the global economy and our business we and some of our customers have experienced facility shutdowns or reductions in operations during the pandemic the outbreak of recent variants has also adversely impacted the staffing level in our operations the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to result in supply chain and operational disruptions such as the availability and transportation of raw materials or the ability for our packaging and equipment specialists to visit customer facilities unpredictable disruptions to the company’s operations or our customers’ operations could reduce our future revenues and negatively impact the company’s financial condition 

in addition economic and market volatility due to the covid19 pandemic may negatively impact consumer buying habits which could adversely affect the company’s financial results 

the extent to which our operations may be impacted by the covid19 pandemic in the future will depend largely on continued developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak including new variants of the virus and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact including the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we operate in 46 countriesterritories and our products are distributed in 114 countriesterritories around the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the us and 47 of our net sales are generated outside of the us these operations particularly those in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present in or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those markets 

risks inherent in our international operations include 

• inflationary pressures including wage inflation and input cost inflation as well as the impact of fiscal policy interventions by national or regional governments to control inflation 

• foreign currency exchange controls and tax rates 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations including devaluations 

• adverse impacts resulting from regional or global human health related illnesses 

• restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters including antidumping duties tariffs embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures 

• changes in laws and regulations including the laws and policies of the us and foreign countries affecting trade and foreign investment 

• the impact of customer perceptions or regulatory developments related to sustainability concerns 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems 

• variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights 

• more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils 

• changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

• import and export delays caused for example by an extended strike at the port of entry could cause a delay in our supply chain operations 

• social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions 

• the potential for governmental actions that may result in expropriation or nationalization of our facilities or other assets in that country 

• unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against us or other interests and 

• potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

uncertain global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

uncertain global economic conditions including the impact of inflationary pressure across the global economy may have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower volumes sold due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example in the past global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our customers and endusers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers restaurants industrial manufacturers retail establishments business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending additionally in 2021 widespread inflationary pressures were experienced across global economies resulting in higher costs for our raw materials nonmaterial cost components and labor 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations profitability or cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this could also result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate  

our packaging products and equipment solution offerings compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price sustainability and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

customers in the ecommerce and food service industry and peers in the packaging industry have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products additionally we may not successfully implement our pricing actions these factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

concerns about the impact that some plastic materials may have on the environment along with changes in legal or regulatory requirements development of recycling infrastructure consumer preferences or market measures to address these concerns may negatively affect our business and operations 

public attention to plastic waste and its associated or perceived environmental impact continues to receive attention some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration labeling and taxation or surcharges of some of our products for example some of our products will be subject to a tax on certain plastics which is currently scheduled to go into effect in 

2022 in the united kingdom consumer perceptions preferences and buying behaviors may change as a result of public attention to plastic waste and current and future regulations 

currently singleuse plastic bans andor proposals have focused on specific items such as grocery bags cutlery beverage straws and stir sticks expanded polystyrene or oxodegradable plastic at present all of the products we manufacture are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurances regarding future laws and regulations 

we maintain programs designed to comply with laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution we also continue to innovate our packaging solutions to exceed recyclability or reusability requirements address cube optimization to eliminate nonrecyclable plastic waste and increase the use of recycled andor renewable materials we believe that execution of our strategy positions us to exceed sustainability and recyclability demands of our customers with innovative solutions and new formulations of our materials however future development of government policies including taxation to restrict waste imports andor expand bans beyond singleuse plastics as well as changes in customer preferences may have an adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the execution of future acquisitions or investments in other companies may be limited by the availability of suitable candidates additionally we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses without significant use of resources or diversion of management’s attention 

acquisitions and noncontrolling or equity investments are subject to the availability of suitable candidates or investment opportunities business acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty in determining valuation integration of acquired operations technologies services and products key personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters ultimately we may be unable to achieve the expected benefits which could adversely affect our business and execution of our strategy 

as a result of acquisitions we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of the related assets 

as a result of acquisitions we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or territories in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including civil unrest acts of terrorism sabotage epidemics force majeure war or other armed conflict and related government actions including sanctionsembargoes the deprivation of contract rights the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials the expropriation or nationalization of our assets and restrictions on travel payments or the movement of funds geopolitical events may have a negative impact on the global industrial macroeconomic environment and could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage may adversely impact our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or future products the resulting loss of associated competitive advantage could lead to decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countriesterritories where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the us and in the foreign countriesterritories in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countriesterritories may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

operational risks 

raw material pricing including how our selling prices reflect the cost of raw materials availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemicalbased raw materials and energy could increase our costs such as those experienced during 2021 

while historically we have been able to successfully manage the impact of higher raw material costs by increasing our selling prices if we were unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected a portion of our sales prices specifically within foods north american and apac business is determined using formula based pricing which reflects changes in underlying raw material indices on average formula based pricing lags raw material cost movement by approximately six months we may experience a benefit when resin prices decrease or detriment when resin prices increase to our cost of sales before those price changes are reflected in our selling prices as such trends in raw material pricing may have a negative impact on future profit margins we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

natural disasters such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future for example throughout 2021 the company experienced supply chain disruptions and sharp raw material price increases resulting in part from disruptions caused by winter storm uri in february 2021 these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies allocation of raw materials and other force majeure events of our suppliers and harm relations with our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

unfavorable customer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings 

from time to time and especially in periods of rising raw material costs we increase the prices of our products for example throughout 2021 the company enacted pricing actions which included price increases across our portfolio significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the 

response by the customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact our results of operations 

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or if we are not able to innovate and bring new products to market 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in food processing and service industries the industrial manufacturing and electronics sectors and ecommerce consumer preferences for food and durable goods packaging can influence our sales consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods and the global ecommerce and industrial market change over time changes in consumer behavior including changes driven by cost availability durability sustainability innovation or various health or environmentalrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

innovation particularly related to our automation sustainability and digital offerings is key to our strategy our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations and we are not able to meet our innovation rate goals our customers preferences continue to trend towards sustainable and automated packaging solutions we believe that we are well positioned to offer these solutions to our customers but our success is dependent on continued innovation in sustainability and our ability to bring new products to market in an efficient manner 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new and sustainable products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry and regulatory standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows  

we are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems or networks or systems of our customers and key vendors could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations to mitigate these threats to our business we maintain a cybersecurity program aligned with industry frameworks designed to protect detect and respond to internal and external threats while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attacks attempting to breach the security of our network and systems none have resulted in a breach with material impact or any penalties or settlement for the three years ended december 31 2021 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the regulatory environment surrounding cybersecurity and data privacy is increasingly demanding with new and changing regulations we could be required to expend additional resources to comply with any such regulations and failure to comply could subject us to significant penalties or claims 

supply chain disruptions related to the transport of raw materials andor finished goods may delay the timing of when we are able to manufacture our product or serve our customers which could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we rely on thirdparty logistics suppliers for the distribution and transportation of raw materials operating supplies and products delays fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure may adversely impact our ability to manufacture and distribute products specifically 

many key ports around the world experienced delays and backlogs in 2021 the company may also incur higher tariffs and duties to obtain materials from suboptimized sourcing locations additionally transportation costs may increase as freight carriers raise prices to address the overall market conditions there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover any past or future increases in transportation costs while we have a geographically diverse international presence and are situated in close proximity to many significant customers continued supply chain disruptions related to the transport of raw materials andor finished goods could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

largescale animal health issues as well as other health issues affecting the food industry and disruptive forces of nature including those resulting from climate change such as significant regional droughts prolonged severe weather conditions floods and natural disasters may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various forces of nature affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply other disruptive forces of nature such as droughts floods and other severe weather can lead to agricultural market disruptions resulting in reduced herd size or modifications to the traditional herd cycles which could affect supply or demand for our products also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we were to experience a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or experience adverse impacts such as plant shutdowns or travel restrictions due to regional or global human health related illness or if such events were to affect a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and thirdparty information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations 

we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to execute our strategies 

the execution and success of our strategy depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies including our strategies related to automation digital and sustainability if any such employee were to cease working for us and we were unable to replace them our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of employees including our direct manufacturing employees the labor market in many geographic regions including the united states is becoming increasingly competitive higher turnover may lead to reductions in operational efficiencies additionally in europe and latin america the majority of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a shortage in the labor pool and other general inflationary pressures or changes the results of our labor negotiations and changes to applicable laws 

and regulations could increase labor costs or cause a disruption in operations which could materially adversely affect our business 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings and may be subject to future claims and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings including the securities class action lawsuit and the stockholder derivative action described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” litigation in general and securities derivative actions and class action litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these proceedings may involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years litigation and other adverse legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect our businesses operating results andor cash flows because of reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings the cost of defending such proceedings the cost of settlement or judgments against us or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings although we maintain legal liability insurance coverage potential litigation claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws that expose us to regulatory scrutiny potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water along with similar legislation aimed at addressing climate change issues 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with applicable environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the fda we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

as countries progress towards longterm environmental stewardship goals we expect laws and tax policy to continue to advance for example in july 2021 the european union announced fit for 55 which is a series of laws and restrictions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 see has processes in place and internal goals related to operating efficiency in matters such as greenhouse gas emissions energy usage and water consumption there is no guarantee these internal goals will be more restrictive than future legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate additionally some of sees materials or products will be subject to a tax on certain plastics or plastic components which are currently scheduled to go into effect in 2022 in jurisdictions such as the united states and the united kingdom there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover the impact of plastic taxes from our customers we maintain programs designed to comply with laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

future changes in global trade policies and regulations as well as overall uncertainty surrounding international trade relations could have a material adverse effect our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

future changes in global trade policies and regulations including tariffs on products we import and export could have an adverse impact on our business additionally future trade policies and regulations are due in part to international relations and other geopolitical factors outside of our control in order to mitigate the impact of these traderelated increases on our costs of products sold we may increase prices in certain markets and over the longer term make changes in our supply chain and potentially our global manufacturing strategy implementing price increases may cause our customers to find alternative sources for their products we may be unable to successfully pass along these costs through price increases adjust our supply chain without incurring significant costs or locate alternative suppliers for raw materials or finished goods at acceptable costs or in a timely manner our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing us and foreign trade policies could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the us internal revenue service the “irs” has indicated that it intends to disallow our deduction of the approximately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement as defined below 

in the past we have reduced taxable income by approximately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement and thus have reduced our us federal tax liability by approximately 525 million the irs has proposed to disallow as deductible expense the entirety of the 149 billion settlement payments although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed disallowance and have filed a protest with the irs this matter may not be resolved in 2022 and there can be no assurance that it will be resolved in the companys favor the matter has been submitted to the irs independent office of appeals for review of the proposed disallowance an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to taxation and tax controversies in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement by the tax authorities with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied 

there are various jurisdictions in which we operate which are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business additional changes in tax laws could increase our overall taxes and our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the us may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of our operations or cash flows 

we are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in assessments against us developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods in which that development occurs we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical accruals 

although the settlement agreement as defined below has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace as defined below if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan as defined below and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we were also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 we completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities beginning in 2000 we were served with a number of lawsuits alleging that the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability or both and that as a result we were responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders staying all asbestos actions against the company the “preliminary injunction” but granted the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” permission to pursue fraudulent transfer successor liability and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction in november 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in each case in connection with the cryovac transaction as memorialized by the parties and approved by the bankruptcy court the “settlement agreement” a definitive settlement agreement was entered into as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement and the settlement agreement was subsequently incorporated into the plan of reorganization for grace filed in september 2008 as filed and amended from time to time the plan subsequently the bankruptcy court in january and february 2011 and the united states district court for the district of delaware in january and june 2012 entered orders confirming grace’s plan of reorganization in its entirety 

on february 3 2014 the “effective date” in accordance with the plan grace emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with the plan and the settlement agreement on the effective date cryovac inc made aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and transferred 18 million shares of sealed air common stock to the pi trust among other things the plan incorporated and implemented the settlement agreement and provided for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the us bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the plan also provided injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims for our benefit in addition under the plan and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations profitability or cash flows 

financial risks 

fluctuations between foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 47 of our net sales in 2021 were generated outside the us we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as a result the company is exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results into us dollars during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors the company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results as exchange rates vary the companys results of operations and profitability may be adversely impacted while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us 

completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 15 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations the gains or losses associated with hedging activities may negatively impact the companys results of operations 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the currency devaluations in argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” for additional information 

our operating results or cash flows can change materially as a result of changes in our geographic mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total income tax provision as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate additionally changes in tax laws or developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods in which that development occurs 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on time or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries the indenture governing certain of our senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default our note holders and lenders could accelerate the repayment of our borrowings the lenders could terminate their commitments to loan money andor foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities our accounts receivable securitization programs our supply chain financing programs and the indentures governing our senior notes may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness 

• pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock 

• prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt 

• make loans and investments 

• sell assets 

• incur liens 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• alter the businesses we conduct 

• enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and 

• consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 

in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

• limited in how we conduct our business 

• unable to respond to changing market conditions 

• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due or 

• unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities 

in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs andor utilization of our supply chain financing programs can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable or payable balances the creditworthiness of us or our customers our receivables collection experience andor our trade payable payment history additionally if our credit ratings were to be downgraded particularly our corporate rating there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2021 we had 512 million of longterm borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 06 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors including future earnings and the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies 

we have deferred tax assets including state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income within each respective jurisdiction during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize the assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us andor certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets our effective tax rate would increase if we were required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could materially and adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the us and in many foreign countriesterritories some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some of these are leased standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters is located in an owned property in charlotte north carolina for a list of those countries and territories outside of the us where we have operations see global scale and market access within “competitive strengths” in item 1

business overview and reportable segments 

sealed air corporation “see” “sealed air” or the “company” also referred to as “we” “us” or “our” is a leading global provider of packaging solutions integrating highperformance materials automation equipment and services see designs and delivers packaging solutions that protect goods preserve food automate packaging processes enable ecommerce and digital connectivity for packaged goods our packaging solutions are designed to help our customers automate their operations to be increasingly touchless and more resilient safer less wasteful and enhance brand engagement with consumers we deliver our packaging solutions to an array of end markets including fresh proteins foods fluids medical and healthcare ecommerce logistics and omnichannel fulfillment operations and industrials our portfolio of solutions includes leading brands such as cryovac ® brand food packaging sealed air ® brand protective packaging autobag ® brand automated packaging bubble wrap ® brand packaging and see automation™ solutions 

the company’s food and protective segments are considered reportable segments under fasb asc topic 280 our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products and customers corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable segments see note 6 “segments” for additional information 

as of january 1 2021 we consolidated the reporting of the north america and south america geographic regions which are now collectively presented as americas within discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations no changes were made to emea or apac 

we employ sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a widespread distribution network fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors food service businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we generally do not impose annual minimum purchase volume requirements on our distributors product returns from our distributors in 2021 were not material in 2021 2020 or 2019 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

on a consolidated basis there normally is minimal seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated results of operations typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality in 2021 however our pricing actions in response to raw material price increases and other inflationary pressures including freight and labor costs resulted in a higher portion of net sales in the second half compared to prior years we expect that net sales and earnings may continue to be impacted by the timing of our pricing actions in response to future fluctuations of raw material costs and other inflationary pressures approximately onethird of foods sales are subject to formula based pricing predominantly within north america and apac which lags raw material cost movement by approximately six months on average additionally changes in endconsumer behavior such as an increase in ecommerce sales or temporary social distancing restrictions due to covid19 or other factors have in the past impacted the timing and seasonality of results of operations 

cash flow from operations tends to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments during 2021 the company generated 510 million in cash flow from operations in the second half compared to 200 million in the first half of 2021 the proportion of cash generated in the second half of the year was relatively consistent with 2020 

the extent and timing of our results of operations may be difficult to predict if significant onetime transactions events or nonrecurring charges were to impact our business 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics automation sustainabilityrelated characteristics of the materials service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous smaller local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials efficiently we also believe that our global presence helps to mitigate the impact of localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses with a strategic capital allocation mindset to create economic value we are making investments to create value while generating operating cash flow that will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders 

each issue of our outstanding senior notes imposes limitations on our operations and those of specified subsidiaries our senior secured credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type including limitations on our indebtedness liens investments restricted payments mergers and acquisitions dispositions of assets transactions with affiliates amendment of documents and sale leasebacks and a covenant specifying a maximum leverage ratio of debt to ebitda we expect continued compliance with our debt covenants including the covenant leverage ratio over the next 12 months see note 14 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

nonus gaap information 

we present financial information that conforms to us gaap we also present financial information that does not conform to us gaap as our management believes it is useful to investors in addition nonus gaap financial measures are used by management to review and analyze our operating performance and along with other data as internal measures for setting annual budgets and forecasts assessing financial performance providing guidance and comparing our financial performance with our peers nonus gaap financial measures also provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the core operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses andor gains which may not occur in each period presented and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and peers more difficult obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts nonus gaap information does not purport to represent any similarly titled us gaap information and is not an indicator of our performance under us gaap investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these nonus gaap financial measures further investors are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to arrive at these nonus gaap financial measures described below 

the nonus gaap financial metrics exclude certain specified items “special items” including restructuring charges and restructuring associated costs adjustments in the valuation of our see ventures portfolio which may include debt or equity investments certain transactions and other charges related to acquisitions and divestitures gains and losses related to acquisitions and divestitures special tax items or tax benefits collectively “tax special items” and certain other items we evaluate unusual or special items on an individual basis our evaluation of whether to exclude an unusual or special item for purposes of determining our nonus gaap financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item including among other things i its nature ii whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations and iii whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis 

when we present nonus gaap forwardlooking guidance we do not also provide guidance for the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability complexity and low visibility with respect to certain special items including gains and losses on the disposition of businesses the ultimate outcome of certain legal or tax proceedings foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the volatile currency market in argentina and other unusual gains and losses these items are uncertain depend on various factors and could be material to our results computed in accordance with us gaap 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude the impact of special items management uses adjusted ebitda as one of many measures to assess the performance of the business additionally adjusted ebitda is the performance metric used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments adjusted ebitda is also a metric used to determine performance in the companys annual incentive plan we do not believe there are estimates underlying the calculation of adjusted ebitda other than those inherent in our us gaap results of operations which would render the use and presentation of adjusted ebitda misleading while the nature and amount of individual special items vary from period to period we believe our calculation of 

adjusted ebitda is applied consistently to all periods and in conjunction with other us gaap and nonus gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda provides a useful and consistent comparison of our companys performance to other periods 

the following table shows a reconciliation of us gaap net earnings from continuing operations to nonus gaap consolidated adjusted ebitda from continuing operations 



   

1 includes depreciation and amortization adjustment of 08 million for the year ended december 31 2019 

the company may also assess performance using adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by net sales we believe that adjusted ebitda margin is a useful measure to assess the profitability of sales made to third parties and the efficiency of our core operations 

adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share “adjusted eps” are also used by the company to measure total company performance adjusted net earnings is defined as us gaap net earnings from continuing operations excluding the impact of special items adjusted eps is defined as our adjusted net earnings divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding we believe that adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps are useful measurements of company performance along with other us gaap and nonus gaap financial measures because they incorporate noncash items of depreciation and amortization including stockbased compensation which impact the overall performance and net earnings of our business additionally adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps reflect the impact of our adjusted tax rate and interest expense on a net and per share basis while the nature and amount of individual special items vary from period to period we believe our calculation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps is applied consistently to all periods and in conjunction with other us gaap and nonus gaap financial measures adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps provide a useful and consistent comparison of our companys performance to other periods 

the following table shows a reconciliation of us gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to nonus gaap adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps from continuing operations 



   

1 net earnings per common share are calculated under the twoclass method 

2 includes pretax special items less tax special items and the tax impact of special items as seen in the following calculation of nonus gaap adjusted income tax rate 

adjusted tax rate 

we also present our adjusted income tax rate “adjusted tax rate” the adjusted tax rate is a measure of our us gaap effective tax rate adjusted to exclude the tax impact from the special items that are excluded from our adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps metrics as well as expense or benefit from any special taxes or tax special items the adjusted tax rate is an indicator of the taxes on our core business the tax circumstances and effective tax rate in the specific countries where the special items occur will determine the impact positive or negative to the adjusted tax rate while the nature and amount of tax special items vary from period to period we believe our calculation of the adjusted tax rate is applied consistently to all periods and in conjunction with our us gaap effective income tax rate the adjusted tax rate provides a useful and consistent comparison of the impact that tax expense has on our companys performance 

the following table shows our calculation of the nonus gaap adjusted income tax rate 



   

1 for the year ended december 31 2021 tax special items reflect interest and other adjustments to existing unrecognized tax positions and deferred tax revaluations associated with legislative changes and administrative interpretations to enacted statutes for the year ended december 31 2020 tax special items reflect net benefits from audit settlements and retroactive application of new gilti regulations offset by withholding expense related to cash repatriation initiatives for the year ended december 31 2019 tax special items reflect net benefits from tax optimization initiatives and research and development credits 

2 the tax rate used to calculate the tax impact of special items is based on the jurisdiction in which the item was recorded 

organic and constant dollar measures 

in our “net sales by geographic region” “net sales by segment” and in some of the discussions and tables that follow we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information which we define as “constant dollar” and we exclude acquisitions in the first year after closing divestiture activity from the time of sale and the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information which we define as “organic” changes in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation andor acquisition and divestiture activity are nonus gaap financial measures as a worldwide business it is important that we consider the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies nonetheless we cannot control changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently when our management analyzes our financial results including performance metrics such as sales cost of sales or selling general and administrative expense to measure the core performance of our business we may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation by translating our current period results at prior period foreign currency exchange rates we also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations as a result our management believes that these presentations are useful internally and may be useful to investors 

refer to these specific tables presented later in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for reconciliations of these nonus gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable us gaap measures 

free cash flow 

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us gaap therefore free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures including certain debt servicing requirements or nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure 

refer to the specific tables presented later in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under analysis of historical cash flow for reconciliations of this nonus gaap financial measure to its most directly comparable us gaap measure 

net debt 

in addition to total debt we use net debt which we define as total debt less cash and cash equivalents as a useful measure of our total debt exposure net debt is not defined under us gaap therefore net debt should not be considered a substitute for amounts owed to creditors or other balance sheet information prepared in accordance with us gaap and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

we continue to execute our reinvent see business transformation focused on the 4ps sm  performance people  digital platforms processes and sustainability during the year the reinvent see business transformation delivered incremental adjusted ebitda benefits of 64 million the restructuring component of the reinvent see business transformation is now expected to conclude by mid2022 the capabilities operational disciplines and governance processes established through the reinvent see business transformation are embedded in our ongoing continuous improvement system and demonstrating sustained results for the year ended december 31 2021 we incurred approximately 31 million or 23 million net of tax in restructuring and restructuring associated charges primarily related to our reinvent see business transformation initiatives cash payments including restructuring payments primarily related to our reinvent see business transformation were 28 million see note 12 “restructuring activities” for additional details regarding each of the company’s restructuring programs 

supply chain disruptions and raw material price increases 

throughout 2021 the company experienced supply chain disruptions and sharp raw material price increases resulting from various factors including general inflationary pressure limited availability of certain raw materials global transportation disruptions and natural disasters such as winter storm uri in february 2021 in addition to higher raw material costs we have incurred higher freight costs associated with the sourcing and movement of raw materials due to overall tight market conditions as a result cost of sales increased from 672 of sales to 696 of sales during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year 

the company implemented price increases throughout the year the associated timing lag on these increases and formulabased pricing has resulted in compressed gross margins defined as the gross profit divided by net sales during the year ended december 31 2021 on average our formulabased pricing lags raw material cost movement by approximately six months approximately onethird of foods sales are subject to formulabased pricing predominantly within the americas and apac formulabased pricing does not comprise a significant portion of sales in our protective segment 

we continue to work closely with our customers and have been leveraging our global supply network and supplier relationships and implementing material substitution where available to meet customers demands and mitigate supply continuity risks however the current environment continues to negatively impact the price and supply of certain raw materials additionally the supply disruptions may result in longer lead times for some of our customers the loss andor delay of sales or the inability to fulfill customer orders any of these developments may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

impact of covid19 

the covid19 pandemic including the outbreak of variants such as delta and omicron and the related containment and mitigation measures that have been put into place across the globe have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the global economy and our business 

we continue to monitor the impact that covid19 has on all aspects of our business and geographies including the impact on our employees customers suppliers business partners and distribution channels 

we and some of our customers have experienced facility shutdowns or reductions in operations during the pandemic the outbreak of recent variants has adversely impacted staffing levels in our operations as affected employees recover from illness or contagious periods 

our diverse endmarkets and geographies continue to experience varying degrees of impact from covid19 the food service market including restaurants entertainment venues and hotels experienced higher activity in 2021 as compared to the prior year when it was more adversely impacted by government mandated shutdowns and social distancing measures this resulted in yearoveryear volume growth for many of our products that support this market protective experienced yearoveryear volume increases in 2021 particularly within industrial segments as economies continued to reopen 

however the environment remains volatile and we cannot predict the future impacts of the pandemic on our business and the markets we serve government agencies may impose future restrictions on commercial activities to limit the spread of the virus including new variants future developments of the pandemic including future spikes or areas of significant regional spread may cause uneven impacts to our geographies around the world 

the health and safety of see’s employees suppliers and customers globally continues to be the company’s top priority safety measures remain in place at our sites such as enhanced cleaning procedures employee temperature checks use of personal protective equipment for locationdependent workers social distancing measures within operating sites and remoteflexible work arrangements for nonlocation dependent employees 

in remote working environments we continue our efforts to mitigate information technology risks including failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks and security breaches of our networks or systems additionally we continue to execute all activities related to our internal control over financial reporting in remote working environments there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended december 31 2021 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

see part i item 1a “risk factors” above for additional risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

current trends and forward looking expectations 

we expect overall demand for our solutions will continue to be strong in 2022 we expect sales for our automated solutions and digital offerings as well as sales through our online enterprise digital commerce channel to continue to increase as we execute on our growth strategies we expect disciplines developed through our reinvent see business transformation to continue to transform into our ongoing continuous improvement program see operating engine driving operational efficiencies and benefits in 2022 and beyond 

however supply chain disruptions and raw material availability will continue to pose challenges we will continue to leverage our global supply network although we expect continued higher freight costs and possible delays in our operations overall we expect higher raw materials costs in 2022 in addition to higher nonmaterial costs and labor inflation in addition inflation labor challenges the impact of covid19 and overall supply chain disruptions are expected to continue to impact our business in 2022 

in the future some of sees products will be subject to a tax on certain plastics which is currently scheduled to go into effect in 2022 in the united kingdom and other european countries in 2023 while we expect to pass through the plastics tax there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover the impact of plastic taxes from our customers not all of our products are subject to the tax as the tax is dependent on various factors including weight gauge material recyclability and recycled content among other factors even if we were not successful in passing through the expense we do not believe the impact of the plastic taxes as planned to go in effect in 2022 or 2023 would have a material impact on our results of operations however the impact of legislation or tax policies that may be amended or proposed and passed in the future is unknown we maintain programs designed to comply with laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution

foreign currency translation impact on consolidated financial results 

since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated financial results into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our financial results from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact historically the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro the australian dollar the british pound the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi the mexican peso the brazilian real and the new zealand dollar

• favorable pricing of 14 million primarily in the americas driven by us dollarbased indexed pricing in south america partially offset by formulabased pricing declines in north america 

• higher volumes of 7 million primarily driven by increased demand for retail protein packaging and equipment sales partially offset by a decline in global food service sales driven by covid19 stayathome restrictions and 

• contributions from acquisition activities of approximately 7 million

2021 compared with 2020 

as reported cost of sales increased by 559 million or 170 in 2021 as compared to 2020 cost of sales was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 49 million as a percentage of net sales cost of sales increased by 240 basis points from 672 in 2020 to 696 in 2021 primarily due to higher input costs resulting from raw material price increases and higher freight costs associated with global supply chain disruptions additionally labor inflation negatively impacted cost of sales higher input labor and freight costs were partially offset by productivity improvements resulting from our reinvent see business transformation initiatives and the benefit of higher volumes on fixed cost components 

2020 compared with 2019

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are included in the table below 



2021 compared with 2020   

as reported sga expenses decreased 1 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 sga expenses were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 9 million on a constant dollar basis sga expenses decreased approximately 10 million or 1 the decrease in sga expenses was primarily the result of lower cashbased incentive compensation expense due to the achieved payout relative to the prior year and benefits from actions associated with our reinvent see business transformation additionally onetime or nonrecurring items charged to sga were lower in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to lower expenses associated with acquisition and divestiture activity and lower restructuring associated items in support of our reinvent see business transformation lower expenses resulting from these items were partially offset by labor inflation 

2020 compared with 2019 

as reported sga expenses decreased 140 million or 15 in 2020 as compared to 2019 sga expenses were impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 6 million on a constant dollar basis sga expenses decreased approximately 134 million or 15 the decrease was primarily driven by a 59 million charge related to a settlement agreement with novipax in 2019 as well as lower restructuring associated costs and lower professional service fees including legal fees associated with special items travel and entertainment related expenses within sga were 19 million lower in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily resulting from covid19 stayathome orders and travel restrictions sga also benefited from reductions driven by our reinvent see business transformation including restructuring associated savings these improvements were partially offset by the impact of higher incentive compensation expense and labor inflation 

amortization expense of intangible assets 

amortization expense of intangible assets for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



the increase in amortization expense of intangibles in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in amortization for capitalized software 

the increase in amortization expense of intangibles in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in amortization for capitalized software and the full year impact of intangible amortization associated with the acquisition of automated packaging systems in august 2019 

see note 5 “divestiture and acquisition activity” for additional details regarding the companys recent acquisition activity 

reinvent see business transformation and restructuring activities 

see note 12 “restructuring activities” for additional details regarding the company’s restructuring programs discussed below 

in december 2018 the sealed air board of directors approved a threeyear restructuring program the program related to the reinvent see business transformation in december 2021 the board of directors approved a sixmonth extension of the 

program primarily in consideration of ongoing initiatives including those related to sees continued transformation to increase digital platforms and offerings the sixmonth extension did not expand the authorized spend of the program of 220 million we now expect the program to be substantially completed by june 30 2022 

we expect the continuous improvement capabilities and governance processes established through reinvent see will continue to transform the see operating engine which is rooted in economic value add with the goal to drive profitable above market organic growth and attractive returns on invested capital 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the program generated incremental cost benefits of 60 million related to reductions in operating costs of which 19 million was related to restructuring actions and 4 million in benefits related to actions impacting pricecost spread 

for the year ended december 31 2020 the program generated incremental cost benefits of 118 million of the incremental cost benefits in 2020 104 million related to reductions in operating costs of which 33 million was related to restructuring actions and 14 million in benefits related to actions impacting pricecost spread 

the decrease in cost benefits generated by the program in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily relates to the timing of when program initiatives were implemented and the yearoveryear incremental cost benefits already realized by the program 

for the year ended december 31 2021 the company incurred restructuring associated expenses of 17 million which were primarily related to third party fees in support of the reinvent see business transformation for the year ended december 31 2021 we recorded restructuring expense of 15 million 

cash outlay for restructuring and restructuring related activities was 28 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 74 million during the year ended december 31 2020 we expect cash outlay for restructuring and restructuring associated costs to be approximately 20 million to 25 million during the year ending december 31 2022 

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to the program described above are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later than expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending benefits and cost synergies 

interest expense net 

interest expense net includes the interest expense on our outstanding debt as well as the net impact of capitalized interest interest income the effects of terminated interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs and credit facility fees bond discounts and terminated treasury locks

brazil tax credits 

certain of our subsidiaries in brazil received a decision from the brazilian court regarding a claim in which see contended that certain indirect taxes paid were calculated on an incorrect amount during the second quarter of 2019 the company filed a return claim for the tax years of 2015 through 2018 resulting from a lower court decision regarding the matter as such the company recorded a 5 million gain in the year ended december 31 2019 

in 2021 the supreme court of brazil issued a final decision that clarified the methodology companies should use in the indirect tax recovery calculation this decision was published and certified by the courts during the third quarter of 2021 as a result of the courts actions the company recognized a benefit of 5 million primarily related to recovery for tax years not previously claimed the claims related to indirect taxes will be used to offset future brazilian indirect tax liabilities 

as a result of this activity the company has been utilizing credits on indirect tax payments 

loss on debt redemptions

income taxes 

the table below shows our effective income tax rate “etr” 



our etr for the year ended december 31 2021 was 314 the difference between the companys etr and the us statutory rate of 21 related primarily to state income tax expense foreign earnings subject to higher tax rates an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and legislative and administrative changes to enacted statutes partially offset by the benefit of research credits 

our etr for the year ended december 31 2020 was 227 the difference between the companys etr and the us statutory rate of 21 related primarily to state income tax expense and foreign earnings subject to higher tax rates partially offset by the benefit from gilti regulations issued by the irs in 2020 research credits and a reduction in valuation allowance due to increased profitability in emea 

our etr for the year ended december 31 2019 was 207 the difference between the companys etr and the us statutory rate of 21 related primarily to benefits related to tax optimization initiatives associated with the reinvent see business transformation and restructuring activities prior year research credits and a reduction in valuation allowance offset by expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and the gilti provisions 

our etr depends upon the realization of our net deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets related to accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards tax credits employee benefit items intangible assets and other items 

the irs completed its field examination of our us federal income tax returns for the years 2011 through 2014 in the third quarter of 2020 as previously disclosed the irs has proposed to disallow for the 2014 taxable year the entirety of the deduction of the approximately 149 billion in settlement payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement as defined in note 20 “commitments and contingencies” and the resulting reduction of our us federal tax liability by approximately 525 million we continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed disallowance and have filed a protest with the irs the matter has been submitted to the irs independent office of appeals for review of the proposed disallowance and we cannot predict when the appeals process will conclude or the outcome of such process it is possible that future developments in this matter could have a material impact on the companys uncertain tax position balances and results of operations including cash flows within the next twelve months 

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences the future income from existing temporary differences and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reduce those valuation allowances we reported a net decrease in our valuation allowance for the year ended december 31 2021 of 18 million primarily related to foreign exchange revaluation on foreign net operating losses see note 19 “income taxes” for additional information

• the 2019 impact of a 7 million noncash inventory stepup charge associated with the automated packaging systems acquisition 

these increases were partially offset by 

• higher operating costs of 12 million including labor inflation higher incentive compensation expense and investments in the business 

• unfavorable pricecost spread of 5 million and 

• unfavorable product mix of 3 million 

corporate 

2021 compared with 2020 

corporate expenses decreased by 1 million on an as reported basis and constant dollar basis as compared to 2020 primarily driven by an increase in nonoperating income on closed defined benefit plans which are not attributable to either reporting segment 

2020 compared with 2019 

corporate expenses decreased by 10 million on an as reported basis and 7 million on a constant dollar basis as compared to 2019 primarily driven by currency transaction gains in 2020 compared to currency transaction losses in 2019 

material commitments and contingencies 

settlement agreement tax deduction 

the information set forth in note 20 “commitments and contingencies” under the caption “settlement agreement tax deduction” is incorporated herein by reference 

contractual obligations 

our contractual obligations primarily consist of shortterm borrowings principal and interest payments on longterm debt operating and financing leases dividend payments compensation and benefit related obligations including defined benefit pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans and other contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business 

see has other principal contractual obligations which include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy assumed in the normal course of business these obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase we may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and as a result use additional cash see note 20 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes for additional information 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2021 we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of 403 million because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with some of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we are not able to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority see note 19 “income taxes” of the notes for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have reviewed our offbalance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements have a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

income tax payments 

we expect tax payments on our operations and the sale of reflectix to be approximately 205 million to 215 million in 2022 future payments are uncertain and dependent on a number of factors including the amount of future taxable income the results of ongoing appeals or audits by various taxing authorities including the irs could increase our tax payments 

interest payments 

estimated future interest payments on the company’s senior notes and senior secured credit facility through the fiscal 2033 are expected to be 715 million based on interest rates at december 31 2021 including 148 million expected in 2022 

contributions to defined benefit pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans for some of our us and our nonus employees we currently expect our contributions to these plans to be approximately 5 million in 2022 additionally we expect benefits related to these plans paid directly by the company to be 9 million in 2022 future contributions and benefits paid directly by the company are uncertain and rely on a number of factors including performance of underlying assets future cash out flows of the plans actuarial assumptions and funding discussions with boards charged with governance for some of our international plans refer to note 17 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” and note 18 “other postemployment benefits and other employee benefit plans” for additional information related to these plans 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

indemnification obligations 

we are a party to many contracts containing guarantees and indemnification obligations these contracts include indemnities in connection with the sale of businesses primarily related to the sale of diversey in 2017 because of the conditional nature of these obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential maximum exposure associated with these items 

capital expenditures 

we expect payments for capital expenditures to be in the range of 240 million to 260 million in 2022 

liquidity and capital resources 

principal sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our senior secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses investments in working capital capital expenditures interest taxes stock repurchases dividends debt obligations restructuring expenses and other longterm liabilities we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months 

as of december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 561 million of which approximately 265 million or 47 was located outside of the us we believe our us cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to us borrowers are sufficient to fund our us operating requirements and capital expenditures current debt obligations and dividends the company does not expect that in the near term cash located outside of the us will be needed to satisfy our obligations dividends and other demands for cash in the us in addition an immaterial amount of our nonus cash balance is deemed to be trapped as of december 31 2021 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents 



see “analysis of historical cash flow” below 

accounts receivable securitization programs 

at december 31 2021 we had 141 million available to us and no outstanding borrowings under our us and european accounts receivable securitization programs at december 31 2020 we had 146 million available to us and no outstanding borrowings under the such programs 

our trade receivable securitization programs represent borrowings secured by outstanding customer receivables therefore the use and repayment of borrowings under such programs are classified as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not recognize the cash flow within operating activities until the underlying invoices have been paid by our customer the trade receivables that served as collateral for these borrowings are reclassified from trade receivables net to prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets see note 10 “accounts receivable securitization programs” for further details 

accounts receivable factoring agreements 

we account for our participation in our customers supply chain financing arrangements and our trade receivable factoring program in accordance with asc 860 which allows the ownership transfer of accounts receivable to qualify for sale treatment when the appropriate criteria are met as such the company excludes the balances sold under such programs from trade receivables net on the consolidated balance sheets we recognize cash flow from operating activities at the point the receivables are sold under such programs see note 11 “accounts receivable factoring agreements” for further details 

gross amounts received under these programs for the year ended december 31 2021 were 687 million of which 207 million was received in the fourth quarter gross amounts received under these programs for the year ended december 31 2020 were 466 million of which 157 million was received in the fourth quarter if these programs had not been in effect for the year ended december 31 2021 we would have been required to collect the invoice amounts directly from the relevant customers in accordance with the agreed payment terms approximately 148 million in incremental trade receivables would have been outstanding at december 31 2021 if collection on such invoice amounts were made directly from our customers on the invoice due date and not through our customers supply chain financing arrangements or our factoring program 

the increase in gross amounts factored under these programs from 2020 to 2021 primarily relates to a customer supply chain financing arrangement used throughout 2021 which we entered during the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as increased usage of 

our trade receivable factoring program during the fourth quarter 2020 we increased the maximum amount available to be sold under that factoring program from 20 million per month to 35 million per month 

payments received through customers supply chain financing arrangements tend to be higher in the fourth quarter the increased use of our trade receivable factoring program had a favorable impact on cash provided by operating activities during the year 

lines of credit 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had a 1 billion revolving credit facility we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility at december 31 2021 or 2020 at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had 1 million and 7 million respectively outstanding under various lines of credit extended to our subsidiaries see note 14 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

libor phase out 

in july 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced the phase out libor in march 2021 the fca announced that specific us dollar libor tenors overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month will continue to be published until june 30 2023 while the 1week and 2month tenors are no longer being published effective december 31 2021 similarly all tenors for eur chf jpy and gbp libor currencies are no longer being published effective december 31 2021 regulators in the us and other jurisdictions have worked to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in liquid and observable markets such as the secured overnight financing rate the phaseout of libor will not have a material impact on our financing or liquidity in march 2020 the fasb issued asu 202004 this asu along with subsequently issued asu 202101 are designed to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform however neither the libor phaseout nor these asus had a material impact on the company 

covenants 

at december 31 2021 we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations as discussed in “covenants” within note 14 “debt and credit facilities” which require us among other things to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of debt to ebitda of 450 to 100 at december 31 2021 our leverage ratio of debt to ebitda as calculated under the covenant was 241 to 100 we expect to be in continued compliance with all of our debt covenants including the covenant leverage ratio over the next 12 months 

supply chain financing programs 

as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our working capital and improve our cash flow we work with suppliers to optimize our purchasing terms and conditions including extending payment terms we also facilitate a voluntary supply chain financing program to provide some of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us our accounts payables to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions these programs are administered by participating financial institutions should the supplier choose to participate in the program it will receive payment from the financial institution in advance of agreed payment terms our responsibility is limited to making payments to the respective financial institutions on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier the range of payment terms is consistent regardless of a vendors participation in the program we monitor our days payable outstanding relative to our peers and industry trends in order to assess our conclusion that these programs continue to be trade payable programs and not indicative of borrowing arrangements the liabilities continue to be presented as trade payables in our consolidated balance sheets until they are paid and they are reflected as cash flows from operating activities when settled 

as of december 31 2021 our accounts payable balance included 161 million related to invoices from suppliers participating in the programs as of december 31 2020 our accounts payable balance included 149 million related to invoices from suppliers participating in the programs the cumulative amounts settled through the supply chain financing programs for the year ended december 31 2021 were 417 million compared to 423 million for the year ended december 31 2020 these programs did not significantly improve our cash provided by operating activities or free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

debt ratings 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency 

   

in september 2021 upon the issuance of our 1573 senior secured notes due 2026 moody’s investor services updated our senior secured credit facility rating from baa1 to baa2 see note 14 “debt and credit facilities” for further details related to the note issuance 

in may 2021 moodys investor services updated our corporate rating from ba2 to ba1 our senior unsecured rating from ba3 to ba2 and our senior secured credit facility rating from baa3 to baa1 

these credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade with the exception of the baa2 and bbb senior secured credit facility rating and senior secured rating from moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s respectively which are classified as investment grade a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

outstanding indebtedness 

at december 31 2021 and 2020 our total debt outstanding and our nonus gaap net debt consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table 





1 amounts are net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs of 19 million and 20 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

see note 14 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

analysis of historical cash flow 

the following table shows the changes in our consolidated statements of cash flows in the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us gaap therefore free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures including certain debt servicing requirements or nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure we historically have generated the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year below are the details of nonus gaap free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



operating activities 

2021 vs 2020 

net cash provided by operating activities was 710 million during 2021 as compared to 737 million during 2020 

net cash used by our working capital accounts inventories trade receivables and accounts payable was 74 million unfavorable during 2021 as compared to 2020 the impact of inventory on cash flow from operating activities was 141 million unfavorable compared to the prior year as a result of higher balances due primarily to raw material cost inflation coupled with business growth and stock build to mitigate continued global supply chain disruptions trade receivables was 138 million unfavorable to prior year due to the impact of higher sales and the year over year impact of our accounts receivable factoring program 2020 year over year increase was more significant than the 2021 increase the unfavorable cash flow impact of inventory and trade receivables was partially offset by accounts payable which generated 205 million higher cash flow than the prior year accounts payable was favorable due to continued raw material price increases throughout 2021 compared to price decreases during 2020 as well as higher logistic and freight balances throughout 2021 due to global supply chain disruptions 

the impact of incentive compensation had a 46 million unfavorable impact on operating cash flow specifically on an indirect basis the december 31 2021 accrual for payout in the first quarter 2022 was approximately 30 million lower than the accrual at december 31 2020 the lower accrual is due to achievement of performance metrics in the respective years additionally incentive compensation cash payments made during the first quarter 2021 were approximately 16 million higher than those made in first quarter 2020 indirect taxes were unfavorable by 25 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of payments and business performance 

this activity was partially offset by a 46 million decrease in restructuring and restructuring associated payments made for our reinvent see business transformation as compared to 2020 as well as 77 million favorable indirect cash flow benefit for income taxes year over year driven by changes in the income tax receivable balance 

2020 vs 2019 

net cash provided by operating activities improved by 226 million during 2020 compared to 2019 this was primarily the result of higher net earnings including noncash add backs in the comparative years 

net earnings were 503 million in 2020 as compared to 263 million in 2019 

noncash add backs to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities were 307 million during 2020 compared to 221 million during 2019 the increase in noncash add backs was primarily driven by the change in deferred tax balances generating 137 million year over year depreciation and amortization increased 23 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to amortization of intangibles for capitalized software and the full year impact of intangible amortization from our acquisition of automated packaging systems these noncash addbacks were partially offset by the noncash gain on sale of businesses which was 19 million in 2020 compared to a loss of 31 million in 2019 representing a change of 50 million the increase in noncash add backs during 2020 was also partially offset by a gain on an equity investment of 15 million in 2020 

the year over year improvement in cash provided by operating activities was also due to decreased cash payments made for our reinvent see business transformation including restructuring and restructuring associated payments which were 74 million during 2020 compared to 91 million during 2019 

working capital which represents cash generated by trade receivables inventories and accounts payable represented a source of cash of 3 million during 2020 compared to 14 million during 2019 cash generation from working capital during 2020 declined primarily due to an increase in cash used for inventory driven by a purposeful build in 2020 for contingency planning against the risk of raw material shortages or supply disruptions resulting from the covid19 pandemic cash generated from trade receivables benefited from improved days sales outstanding resulting partially from the increased use of our trade receivable factoring program the year over year changes in accounts payable were largely due to the timing of payments to suppliers cash generated from customer advance payments increased 8 million as the company increased automation and equipment sales 

investing activities 

2021 vs 2020 

net cash used in investing activities was 126 million during 2021 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 160 million during 2020 

in 2021 see generated a total of 89 million from the sale of businesses and property and equipment this was primarily driven by the fourth quarter 2021 sale of reflectix inc which generated proceeds of 83 million cash received from the sale of businesses and property and equipment was 12 million in 2020 

additionally the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts generated 8 million during 2021 and corporate owned life insurance contracts generated 8 million during 2021 this compares to cash generation from foreign currency forward contracts of 2 million during 2020 the company previously maintained a corresponding asset on the consolidated balance sheets for the corporate owned life insurance there was no impact to the statements of operations during the year ended december 31 2021 related to the corporate owned life insurance proceeds 

these investing cash sources were offset by investments in the business under our see ventures initiative as well as higher capital expenditures as we invest in our growth strategies 

capital expenditures were 32 million higher during 2021 than compared to 2020 the increase reflects the companys continued investment in assets which support growth coupled with lower spending in the prior year due to the impact of covid19 

during 2021 we invested a total of 18 million in see ventures comprised of the following activity 

• 9 million as an additional equity investment in a previously existing investee focused on ecommerce and fulfillment operations 

• 8 million made in the form of a convertible debt of an investee company focused on developing digital advancements in packaging and 

• 1 million investment in a fund aimed to advance scalable recycling technologies equipment upgrades and infrastructure solutions which is being accounted for as an equity method investment 

see note 16 “fair value measurements equity investments and other financial instruments” for more information on our equity investments 

investing activity in 2020 also included cash generation of 14 million from the maturity of cash deposits greater than 90 days marketable securities with no similar activity in the current year 

2020 vs 2019 

net cash used in investing activities was 160 million during 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 666 million during 2019 the change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 2019 business acquisitions activity of 454 million predominately related to the automated packaging systems acquisition a favorable purchase price adjustment of 4 million was received during the first quarter 2020 related to the automated packaging systems acquisition 

in 2019 the company invested in cash deposits with maturities greater than 90 days marketable securities which matured in 2020 and then converted back into a cash equivalent generating a net favorable impact to investing activities of 26 million during 2020 compared to 2019 

proceeds related to the sale of businesses and property increased 15 million compared to 2019 resulting from the sale of two discrete properties in emea generating 6 million cash inflow during 2020 as well as the impact of recoveries of tax refund amounts related to diversey entities which were owed to us 

during 2020 we made a total investment of 8 million in an equity holding this is classified as an investing cash flow activity based on our strategic investment thesis of anticipated partnership in increasing plastic circularity 

financing activities 

2021 vs 2020 

net cash used in financing activities was 576 million during 2021 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 262 million during 2020 the increase in cash outflows for financing activities was primarily related to increased share repurchases dividend payments and payments for debt extinguishment costs 

during 2021 the company paid 403 million for share repurchases compared to 33 million during in 2020 

dividends paid of 116 million were 15 million higher than the prior year due to the increase in quarterly dividend announced in the second quarter 2021 

debt related activities was a cash use of 32 million during 2021 compared to a use of cash of 105 million during 2020 cash used for debt related activities during 2020 was primarily related to payment of the outstanding balance on the companys revolving credit facility from 2019 utilization current year cash activity related to debt primarily relates to receipts from the issuance of 600 million 1573 senior secured notes due 2026 net of 5 million in capitalized issuance costs this partially was offset by the payment of 442 million related to the early extinguishment of the 4875 senior note due 2022 including early payment premium of 17 million and 183 million in payments on the companys term loan a which includes the scheduled quarterly payments and the early repayment of 175 million in principal amount using the proceeds of the 1573 senior secured notes issuance 

we continue to employ a purposedriven capital allocation strategy to determine the best use of cash including decisions regarding share repurchases our debtleverage ratio acquisitions and investments in growth and operational efficiency 

2020 vs 2019 

net cash used in financing activities was 262 million during 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 140 million during 2019 the change in net cash used in provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowing activity in 2019 specifically during 2019 we received proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 895 million including the 475 million representing the term loan a due 2022 and the issuance of 425 million of 400 of senior notes which were partially offset by the 425 million repurchase of the 650 senior notes lower repayments of shortterm borrowings of 29 million were primarily due to higher payments on our revolving credit facility in 2019 compared to 2020 at december 31 2020 we had no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility 

cash outlay for share repurchases were 33 million during 2020 compared to 67 million during 2019 

changes in working capital   

   

the 452 million or 88 decrease in working capital was primarily due to the following 

• increase in current portion of longterm debt of 465 million primarily due to the reclassification of 475 million related to the term loan a due august 2022 

• increase in accounts payable of 206 million primarily due to higher raw material prices and freight expense and 

• decrease in income tax receivables of 42 million 

the decreases in working capital were partially offset by 

• increase in inventory of 129 million primarily on rising input costs 

• increase in trade receivables of 79 million primarily on higher sales in the current year 

• decrease in other current liabilities of 23 million primarily on lower incentive compensation related accruals at yearend and 

• increases in the cash and cash equivalents and other receivable balances of 12 million and 14 million respectively 

changes in stockholders’ equity 

the 76 million increase in stockholders’ equity in 2021 compared with 2020 was due to 

• net earnings of 507 million 

• a net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 35 million on unrecognized pension items due primarily to market conditions impacting actuarial assumptions as of our annual pension valuation date 

• unrealized gains on derivative instruments of 33 million 

• the effect of sharebased incentive compensation of 30 million including the impact of sharebased compensation expense and netting of shares to cover the employee tax withholding amounts and 

• stock issued for profit sharing contribution paid in stock of 28 million 

these increases were partially offset by 

• repurchases of 79 million shares of our common stock for 402 million including commissions paid see note 21 “stockholders’ deficit equity” for further details 

• dividends paid on our common stock and dividend equivalent accruals related to unvested equity awards of 117 million and 

• cumulative translation adjustment “cta” loss of 39 million

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel thirdparty experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of trade receivables as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have historically adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or for which additional information has been provided on which to review the probability and measurability of outcomes and will continue to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment the impairment model is a two step test under which we first calculate the recoverability of the carrying value by comparing the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group including its estimated residual value to the carrying amount if the cash flows associated with the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value we would perform a fair value assessment of the asset or asset group if the carrying amount is found to be greater than the fair value we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite–lived intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate we recorded no impairment to indefinite lived assets in the current year 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment  the “component” level  discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

in our annual impairment review we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in a qualitative assessment we would consider the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general economic conditions industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulatory and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation and events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the carrying value of net assets 

if the results of our qualitative assessment indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we are required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 

alternatively if an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed we may perform a quantitative assessment under the quantitative assessment we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value there would be no indication of impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit were less than the carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

under the quantitative assessment we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value fair value computed by these models is arrived at using a number of factors and inputs there are inherent uncertainties however related to fair value models the inputs and our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 

we believe the most significant inputs while performing a quantitative assessments include 

• forecasted future operating results on an annual basis the company prepares annual and mediumterm financial projections these projections are based on input from the companys leadership strategy commercial leadership and finance teams and presented to our board of directors annually 

• discount rate our thirdparty valuation specialists provide inputs into managements determination of the discount rate the rate is dependent on a number of underlying assumptions the most impactful of which are the riskfree rate tax rate equity risk premium debt to equity ratio and pretax cost of debt 

• longterm growth rate longterm growth rates are applied to the terminal year of our cash flow valuation approach the longterm growth rates are tied to growth rates we expect to achieve beyond the years for which we have forecasted operating results we also consider external benchmarks including forecasted longterm gdp growth and other data points which we believe are applicable to our industry and the composition of our global operations 

the company performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of october 1 2021 based on our qualitative assessment we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units sufficiently exceeds the carrying value as part of our analysis we performed a look back over the key assumptions impacting the quantitative test performed in 2020 including forecasted operating results and discount rates 

the company also assesses its goodwill for impairment from time to time when warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding individual reporting units subsequent to our annual reporting period we continued to assess whether there were 

changes in facts or circumstances that would lead us to believe goodwill may be impaired no indication of goodwill impairment has been identified subsequent to our annual testing date 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019 we performed quantitative assessments for our annual impairment test no indication of goodwill impairment was identified in either 2020 or 2019 

see note 9 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets net” for details of our goodwill balances as of 2021 2020 and 2019 and additional information related to the qualitative assessment performed in 2021 

pensions 

for a number of our current and former us and international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year we believe the most significant assumptions are the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected future rate of return on plan assets we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life or expected life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 

at december 31 2021 the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plan was 185 million and the total benefit income for the year ended december 31 2021 was 3 million at december 31 2021 the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 714 million and the total benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2021 was 2 million the employer service cost of our pension plans is charged to cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses all other components of benefits expense are recorded to other expense income net 

material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2021 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2022 





during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company purchased a buyin insurance contract which covered the remaining portion of the liability for one of our defined benefit pension plans in the uk the total projected benefit obligation of the plan is 15 million the projected benefit obligation was developed using actuarial assumptions that would be used in a plan termination or buyout basis under a full buyout the liabilities are fully transferred to an insurance or annuity provider and see would no longer maintain the liability or administrative responsibilities we expect this plan to move to full buyout in 2022 or 2023 as of december 31 2021 the fair value of the assets for this plan matched the projected benefit obligation and there was no material net balance sheet position for this plan recorded within our assets or liabilities the plan has an accumulated comprehensive loss of 7 million recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity on our balance sheet as of december 31 2021 upon plan termination or full buyout the accumulated comprehensive loss would be recognized to other expense income within the statement of operations 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences carryforwards of tax losses and tax credits we provide a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets we estimate future taxable earnings and consider the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish a liability for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust this liability to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the liability the reversal of the liability would result in tax benefit being recognized in the period when we determine the liability is no longer necessary if an estimate of the tax liability proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to the income tax provision would result these adjustments to liabilities and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized on the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 19 “income taxes” for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2021 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps collars or options 

the information set forth in note 15 “derivatives and hedging activities” under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 16 “fair value measurements equity investments and other financial instruments” for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in 

interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 36 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2021 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

argentina 

economic events in argentina including the default on some of its international debt obligations which have subsequently been renegotiated exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks despite some debt restructuring fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the argentine peso continue to impact our financial results as of july 1 2018 argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we recognized a remeasurement loss of 4 million 5 million and 5 million respectively within other expense income net on the consolidated statements of operations related to the designation of argentina as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” for additional information as of december 31 2021 1 of our consolidated net sales were derived from our products sold in argentina and net assets include 5 million of cash and cash equivalents domiciled in argentina also as of december 31 2021 our argentina subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 24 million 

russia and ukraine 

the us and the eu have imposed sanctions on various sectors of the russian economy and on transactions with certain russian nationals and entities russia has also announced economic sanctions against the us and other nations that include a ban on imports of certain products 

additionally escalating geopolitical activity between russia and ukraine may have regional impacts on the business environment in europe 

this activity is not expected to have a material impact on our business as much of our operations within both countries are supported by local production however they may limit the amount of future business the company does with customers involved in activities in russia or ukraine as of december 31 2021 we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact to our 2022 results of operations as of december 31 2021 2 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold in russia and less than 1 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold in ukraine assets include 4 million of cash and cash equivalents domiciled in russia and less than 1 million in ukraine also as of december 31 2021 our russia subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 39 million while our ukrainian subsidiary had cumulative translation losses of 5 million 

brazil 

recent economic events in brazil including changes in the benchmark interest rate set by the brazilian central bank have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks however as of december 31 2021 we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2022 results of operations as of december 31 2021 2 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into brazil and net assets include 11 million of cash and cash equivalents also as of december 31 2021 our brazil subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 70 million 

impact of inflation and currency fluctuation 

economic and political events in certain countries have exposed us to heightened levels of inflation and foreign currency exchange risks the effects of these could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations see note 2 

“summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” for details regarding the impact of inflation and currency fluctuation also for a discussion of our risk factors please refer to part i item 1a “risk factors” 

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2021 would have caused us to pay approximately 28 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 15 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is incorporated herein by reference 

net investment hedge 

the €400 million 450 notes issued in june 2015 are designated as a net investment hedge hedging a portion of our net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the decrease in the translated value of the debt was 2 million net of tax as of december 31 2021 and is reflected in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in other expense income net on the consolidated statements of operations 

other derivative instruments 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower or in euros as is the case with the issuance of €400 million of 450 senior notes due 2023 we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the us dollar equivalent amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 492 million and 541 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

customer credit 

effective january 1 2020 the company adopted asu 201613 which requires us to measure all expected credit losses for trade receivables held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model which includes historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for credit losses on trade receivables for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons 

pensions 

many of our us and international defined benefit pension plans are invested in assets which will be used to cover future benefit payments assets may include investments in mutual funds collective investment trusts indexfunds corporate bonds governmentbacked bonds and insurance contracts or annuity buyins the assets include both return seeking assets and 

liabilityhedging assets as the population of the plan participants age and future cash flows become more certain we undertake asset derisking initiatives including the purchase of buyin contracts particularly in the united kingdom these investments provide a stream of income equal to future benefit payments for predefined groups of participants however the company maintains the primary liability for the projected benefit obligation related to these groups as of december 31 2021 and 2020 buyin contracts represented 135 million or 16 and 131 million or 16 of the companys total plan assets respectively additionally our plan assets may from time to time be invested in assets designed to diversify the investment portfolio and protect against equity market movements some of these assets may only be redeemed on a quarterly basis as of december 31 2021 and 2020 equity diversifying assets represented 95 million or 11 and 86 million or 10 of the companys total plan assets respectively other than the buyin contracts and equity diversifiers noted above we believe that our plan assets are highly liquid and may be readily redeemed to cover necessary plan payments there is a high degree of predictability of payments made from our defined benefit plans 

based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2021 we expect net periodic benefit income to be approximately 3 million in 2022 see note 17 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

reportable segments 

food 

food largely serves perishable food processors in fresh red meat smoked and processed meat poultry seafood plantbased and dairy solids and liquids markets worldwide food offers highperformance packaging materials and automated equipment solutions to increase food safety extend shelf life automate processes and optimize total cost its innovative sustainable materials automated equipment and services are designed to enable customers to reduce costs and enhance their 

brands in the marketplace food solutions are marketed under the cryovac ® trademark and other highly recognized trade names including cryovac grip  tear ®  cryovac darfresh ®  cryovac mirabella ®  simple steps ® and optidure ™  

food solutions are well aligned to capitalize on global market dynamics driven by continued urbanization global growth of middle class the efood movement growing consumer preference for smaller portions and healthier food choices increasing labor scarcity and demand for more sustainable secure packaging our solutions innovative materials and proven equipment and services are designed to preserve nutrition while enhancing food safety technologies used in food and continued investment in innovation positions us to not only address but to be a global provider of solutions for sustainable packaging 

food applications are largely sold direct to customers by our sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world sales to governments or government contracts are not material to our food segment no single customer or affiliated group of customers represents more than 10 of segment revenue 

there are other manufacturers of products similar to those produced by food some that operate across multiple regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials 

protective 

protective packaging solutions are utilized across many global markets and are especially valuable to ecommerce consumer goods pharmaceutical and medical devices and industrial manufacturing with automated equipment sustainable materials and services our solutions are designed to increase our customers packaging velocity minimize packaging waste reduce labor dependencies and address dimensional weight challenges our product breadth combined with our global scale and reach helps support our customers needs for performance excellence consistency and reliability of supply wherever they operate around the world 

protective solutions are marketed under brands including bubble wrap ® brand inflatable packaging autobag ® brand bagging systems and sealed air ® brand performance shrink films protective product families include additional trade names such as instapak ® polyurethane foam packaging solutions and korrvu ® suspension and retention packaging furthermore we provide temperature assurance packaging solutions under the kevothermal tm and tempguard tm brands 

protective solutions are sold directly to our customers as well as through our partnership with a strategic network of distributors that service business and industrial endusers in 2020 approximately 60 of our protective sales were sold through distributors we generally do not impose annual minimum purchase volume requirements on our distributors returns from our distributors in 2020 were not material sales to governments or government contracts are not material to our protective segment in 2020 one of our distributors represented approximately 10 of protectives net sales no other single customer or affiliated group of customers represented more than 10 of segment revenue 

there are other manufacturers of products similar to those produced by protective additionally there are products made using alternative packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are paper packaging expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags and corrugated boxes as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts wood blocking and bracing systems and an assortment of automated packaging and fulfillment systems we believe that some of our direct competition within the protective packaging industry has a less diversified global presence 

some of our food and protective competitors have been consolidating in recent years or have been involved in significant merger and acquisition activity and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations additionally we believe that a focus on sustainability automation and equipment offering will continue to define the direction of the competitive landscape into the future in both segments 

raw materials and purchasing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components contract manufactured goods equipment and other direct materials such as inks films and paper our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins as well as paper pulp products raw materials typically represent approximately onethird of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers automated equipment and accessories are designed for ecommerce fulfillment centers industrial and food packaging equipment 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however in some regions we rely on some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes tornados earthquakes or other severe weather events as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies allocation of raw materials and other force majeure events by our suppliers we purchase some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global purchasing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of purchasing and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent purchasing practices 

seasonality 

on a consolidated basis there is minimal seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated results of operations typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality historically net sales in our food segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our protective segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season however the extent and timing of our results of operations may be difficult to predict if significant onetime transactions events or nonrecurring charges were to impact our business cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

throughout 2020 the covid19 pandemic has resulted in anomalies to historical seasonality trends generated by changes in endconsumer behavior such as an increase in ecommerce sales or temporary closures or productivity reductions within our customers operations we cannot predict the impact to the markets we serve or the timing or extent of sales due to the prolonged impact or future spread or worsening of the covid19 pandemic or future restrictions on commercial activities by governmental agencies to limit future spread of the virus in addition to covid19 other factors may also outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs timing of pricing actions foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

compliance with government regulations 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countriesterritories jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover among other things the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment and standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes we have an environmental management system that aids in our management of environmental health and safety matters pertaining to our operations key elements of this environmental management system are implemented throughout our operations we believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance and similar nonus laws has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations which ensure safe working conditions for our employees in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us occupational safety and health administration “osha” to date the cost of complying with worker safety requirements and osha compliance and similar nonus laws has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees we have policies in place which guide the company in environmental health and safety matters including training materials conservation communications targets and transparency 

we maintain programs to comply with the various laws rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countriesterritories in which we operate see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “environmental matters”

 item 1a risk factors 

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” immediately preceding part i of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

strategic risks 

the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact the health and safety of our employees our business continuity consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

even though our business operations have been deemed essential by many governmental agencies in previous governmentimposed commercial and social restrictions there could be unpredictable disruptions to the company’s operations or our customers operations as a result of the current covid19 pandemic we and some of our customers have experienced facility shutdowns during the pandemic unpredictable disruptions to the company’s operations or our customers’ operations could reduce our future revenues and negatively impact the company’s financial condition the covid19 pandemic may result in supply chain and operational disruptions such as the availability and transportation of raw materials or the ability for our packaging and equipment specialists to visit customer facilities affected employees could impact the company’s ability to operate our facilities and distribute products to our customers in a timely fashion 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has at times resulted in volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets as well as widespread economic deterioration including an increase in global unemployment this economic and market volatility and loss of employment may negatively impact consumer buying habits which could adversely affect the company’s financial results 

we experienced limited facility closures as a result of initial government orders in response to the pandemic additionally in some jurisdictions we have at times reduced production capacity due to local social distancing requirements which limit the number of employees in our facility these instances have not had a material impact on our operations to date however the extent to which our operations may be impacted by the covid19 pandemic in the future will depend largely on continued developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak including variants of the virus and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact including the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers restaurants industrial manufacturers retail establishments business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations profitability or cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we operate in 46 countriesterritories and our products are distributed to 117 countriesterritories around the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the us and 47 of our net sales are generated outside of the us these operations particularly in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 

• foreign currency exchange controls and tax rates 

• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations including devaluations 

• adverse impacts resulting from regional or global human health related illnesses 

• the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions including local inflationary pressures or impacts resulting from the united kingdoms exit from the european union 

• restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters including antidumping duties tariffs embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures 

• changes in laws and regulations including the laws and policies of the us affecting trade and foreign investment 

• the impact of customer perceptions or regulatory developments related to sustainability concerns 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems 

• variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights 

• more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils 

• changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

• import and export delays caused for example by an extended strike at the port of entry could cause a delay in our supply chain operations 

• social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities 

• unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against us or other interests and 

• potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products and equipment solution offerings compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price sustainability and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

customers in the ecommerce and food service industry and peers in the packaging industry have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products additionally we may not successfully implement our pricing actions these factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

concerns about the impact that some plastic materials have on the environment along with changes in legal or regulatory requirements customer preferences or market measures to address these concerns may negatively affect our business and operations 

public attention to plastic waste and its associated environmental impact continues to increase some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products customer preferences and buying 

behaviors may change as a result of public attention to plastic waste and current and future regulations currently singleuse plastic bans andor proposals have focused on specific items such as grocery bags cutlery beverage straws and stir sticks expanded polystyrene or oxodegradable plastic at present none of the products we manufacture have been banned 

we maintain programs designed to comply with laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution we also continue to innovate our packaging solutions to exceed recyclability or reusability requirements address cube optimization to eliminate nonrecyclable plastic waste and increase the use of recycled andor renewable materials we believe that execution of our strategy positions us to exceed sustainability and recyclability demands of our customers with innovative solutions and new formulations of our materials however future development of government policies to restrict waste imports andor expand bans beyond singleuse plastics as well as changes in customer preferences may have an adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses without significant use of resources or diversion of management’s attention additionally these businesses may underperform relative to our expectations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty in determining valuation integration of acquired operations technologies services and products key personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters ultimately we may be unable to achieve the expected benefits and synergies which could adversely affect our business additionally future acquisition activity may be limited by the availability of suitable acquisition candidates 

as a result of acquisitions we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of the related assets 

as a result of acquisitions we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or territories in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including civil unrest acts of terrorism sabotage epidemics force majeure war or other armed conflict and related government actions including sanctionsembargoes the deprivation of contract rights the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials the expropriation or nationalization of our assets and restrictions on travel payments or the movement of funds geopolitical events may have a negative impact on the global industrial macroeconomic environment and could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or future products the resulting loss of associated competitive advantage could lead to decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countriesterritories where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the us and in the foreign countriesterritories in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countriesterritories may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

operational risks 

raw material pricing including how our selling prices reflect the cost of raw materials availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemicalbased raw materials and energy could increase our costs while historically we have been able to successfully manage the impact of higher raw material costs by increasing our selling prices if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected a portion of our sales prices specifically within foods north american and apac business is determined using formula based pricing which reflects changes in underlying raw material indices formula based pricing lags raw material cost movement by approximately six months we may experience a benefit when resin prices decrease or detriment when resin prices increase to our cost of goods sold before those price changes are reflected in our selling prices as such trends in raw material pricing may have a negative impact on future profit margins we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

natural disasters such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies allocation of raw materials and other force majeure events of our suppliers and harm relations with our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

unfavorable customer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings 

from time to time and especially in periods of rising raw material costs we increase the prices of our products significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by the customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact our results of operations 

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or if we are not able to innovate and bring new products to market 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in food processing and service industries the industrial manufacturing and electronics sectors and ecommerce consumer preferences for food and durable goods 

packaging can influence our sales consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods and the global ecommerce and industrial market change over time changes in consumer behavior including changes driven by cost availability durability sustainability innovation or various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

innovation is key to our strategy our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations and we are not able to meet our innovation rate goals our customers preferences continue to trend towards sustainable packaging solutions we believe that we are well positioned to offer these solutions to our customers but our success is dependent on continued innovation in sustainability and our ability to bring new products to market in an efficient manner 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new and sustainable products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry and regulatory standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

largescale animal health issues as well as other health issues affecting the food industry and disruptive forces of nature including those resulting from climate change such as significant regional droughts prolonged severe weather conditions floods and natural disasters may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various forces of nature affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply other disruptive forces of nature such as droughts floods and other severe weather can lead to agricultural market disruptions resulting in reduced herd size or modifications to the traditional herd cycles which could affect supply or demand for our products also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations to mitigate these threats to our business we maintain a cyber security program aligned with industry frameworks designed to protect detect and respond to internal and external threats while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience attacks attempting to breach the security of our network and systems none have resulted in a breach with material impact or any penalties or settlement for the three years ended december 31 2020 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the regulatory environment surrounding cybersecurity and data privacy is increasingly demanding with new and changing regulations we could be required to expend additional resources to comply with any such regulations and failure to comply could subject us to significant penalties or claims 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we were to experience a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or experience adverse impacts such as plant shutdowns or travel restrictions due to regional or global human health related illness or if such events were to affect a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and thirdparty information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations 

we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to execute our strategies 

our success and execution of our strategy depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies including our strategies related to innovation automation and sustainability if any such employee were to cease working for us and we were unable to replace them our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially adversely affect our business 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

we are involved in an ongoing investigation by the us securities and exchange commission 

the company previously received from the staff of the sec subpoenas for documents and requests for information in connection with the secs previously disclosed investigation those subpoenas and requests sought documents and information regarding the companys accounting for income taxes its financial reporting and disclosures the process by which the company selected its former independent audit firm which audited the fiscal years of 2015 through 2018 the independence of that audit firm and other matters 

the company is fully cooperating with the sec the company understands that the secs investigation is continuing and cannot predict the outcome or duration of that investigation any determination that the companys previous audit firm was not independent during the years it audited could require that certain of our historical financial statements be reaudited by a different registered public accounting firm which could affect our ability to comply with certain reporting obligations imposed by federal securities laws 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings and may be subject to future claims and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings including the securities class action lawsuit stockholder derivative action and other actions described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” litigation in general and securities derivative actions and class action litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these proceedings may involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years litigation and other adverse legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our businesses 

operating results andor cash flows because of reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings the cost of defending such proceedings the cost of settlement or judgments against us or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws that expose us to regulatory scrutiny potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water along with similar legislation aimed at addressing climate change issues 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with applicable environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the fda we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

changes in us trade policies and regulations as well as the overall uncertainty surrounding international trade relations could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

continued developments and recent changes in us trade policies have had and we expect that they will continue to have an adverse effect on our costs of products sold and margins in our north america region on july 1 2020 the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca became effective which replaced the north american free trade agreement nafta uncertainty remains on future trade deals or continued tariffs placed on imports and exports to and from other countries additional tariffs and changes to the us trade policies would likely adversely impact our business furthermore other countries may change their own trade policies including the imposition of additional tariffs and quotas which could also adversely affect our business outside the us 

in order to mitigate the impact of these traderelated increases on our costs of products sold we may increase prices in certain markets and over the longer term make changes in our supply chain and potentially our us manufacturing strategy implementing price increases may cause our customers to find alternative sources for their products we may be unable to successfully pass on these costs through price increases adjust our supply chain without incurring significant costs or locate alternative suppliers for raw materials or finished goods at acceptable costs or in a timely manner our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing us and foreign trade policies could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the us internal revenue service the “irs” has indicated that it intends to disallow our deduction of the approximately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement as defined below 

in the past we have reduced taxable income by approximately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement and thus have reduced our us federal tax liability by approximately 525 million the irs has proposed to disallow as deductible expense the entirety of the 149 billion settlement payments although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed disallowance and are protesting it with the irs this matter may not be resolved in 2021 and there can be no assurance that it will be resolved in the companys favor an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied in 2017 the united states us enacted significant tax reform the tax cuts and jobs act or “tcja” and certain provisions or interpretations of the new law may adversely affect us for example the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries or “transition tax” involved complex calculations and had a material impact on our financial results in 2018 

many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business 

additional changes in tax laws could increase our overall taxes and our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the us may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of our operations or cash flows 

although the settlement agreement as defined below has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace as defined below if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan as defined below and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we were also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 we completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities beginning in 2000 we were served with a number of lawsuits alleging that the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability or both and that as a result we were responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders staying all asbestos actions against the company the “preliminary injunction” but granted the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” permission to pursue fraudulent transfer successor liability and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the 

cryovac transaction in november 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in each case in connection with the cryovac transaction as memorialized by the parties and approved by the bankruptcy court the “settlement agreement” a definitive settlement agreement was entered into as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement and the settlement agreement was subsequently incorporated into the plan of reorganization for grace filed in september 2008 as filed and amended from time to time the plan subsequently the bankruptcy court in january and february 2011 and the united states district court for the district of delaware in january and june 2012 entered orders confirming grace’s plan of reorganization in its entirety 

on february 3 2014 the “effective date” in accordance with the plan grace emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with the plan and the settlement agreement on the effective date cryovac inc made aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and transferred 18 million shares of sealed air common stock to the pi trust among other things the plan incorporated and implemented the settlement agreement and provided for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the us bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the plan also provided injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims for our benefit in addition under the plan and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations profitability or cash flows 

financial risks 

fluctuations between foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 47 of our net sales in 2020 were generated outside the us we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as a result the company is exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results into us dollars during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors the company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results as exchange rates vary the companys results of operations and profitability may be adversely impacted while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 15 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations the gains or losses associated with hedging activities may negatively impact the companys results of operations 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the currency devaluations in argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” for additional information 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our geographic mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate additionally changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on time or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries the indenture governing certain of our senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default our note holders and lenders could accelerate the repayment of our borrowings the lenders could terminate their commitments to loan money andor foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities our accounts receivable securitization programs our supply chain financing programs and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness 

• pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock 

• prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt 

• make loans and investments 

• sell assets 

• incur liens 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• alter the businesses we conduct 

• enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and 

• consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 

in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

• limited in how we conduct our business 

• unable to respond to changing market conditions 

• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due or 

• unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities 

in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs andor utilization of our supply chain financing programs can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable or payable balances the creditworthiness of us or our customers our receivables collection experience andor our trade payable payment history 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2020 we had 696 million of longterm borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 09 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors including future earnings and the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies 

we have deferred tax assets including state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income within each respective jurisdiction during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize the assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us andor certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets our effective tax rate would increase if we were required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could materially and adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that are not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 2 properties 

we manufacture products in 106 facilities with 15 of those facilities serving both of our business segments the following table shows our manufacturing facilities by geographic region and our business segment reporting structure 



other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the us and in many foreign countriesterritories some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some of these are leased standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters is located in an owned property in charlotte north carolina for a list of those countries and territories outside of the us where we have operations see global scale and market access within “market strategy and competitive strengths” above 

we believe that our manufacturing warehouse office and other facilities are well maintained suitable for their purposes and adequate for our needs

business and reportable segments 

sealed air is in business to protect to solve critical packaging challenges and to make our world better than we found it our materials automated equipment and services maximize food safety and security and product protection while minimizing waste we serve an array of end markets including protein foods fluids medical and life sciences pet care ecommerce and logistics and industrials in the markets we serve we leverage our differentiated materials equipment and services iconic brands wellestablished customer relationships and global scale and market access our portfolio of packaging solutions includes cryovac ® brand food packaging sealed air ® brand protective packaging autobag ® brand automated packaging systems bubble wrap ® brand packaging and see automation solutions 

the company’s segment reporting structure consists of two reportable segments food and protective and a corporate category one of the components of our reinvent see business transformation is to enhance the operational efficiency of the company by acting as “one see” to that end organizations and teams focused solely on food or protective have merged to bring focus on the strategic direction of the total company karl deily stepped down from his position as senior vice president and chief commercial officer effective as of december 31 2020 and will continue to serve the company in an advisory role until his retirement on april 2 2021 effective january 1 2021 sealed airs regional leaders consisting of the president of asia pacific “apac” the president of europe middle east and africa “emea” and the president of the americas assumed mr deilys responsibilities on a regional basis reporting directly to the president and chief executive officer notwithstanding these actions the companys chief operating decision maker continues to review and assess performance and make operating decisions based on the food and protective reporting structure we continue to conclude that food and protective represents our reportable segments under fasb asc topic 280 as of december 31 2020 

the company’s food and protective segments are considered reportable segments under fasb asc topic 280 our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products and customers corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to or monitored by the reportable segments management see note 6 “segments” for additional information 

in the second quarter 2020 we renamed our reporting segments from food care to food and from product care to protective this segment reporting name change aligns with our use internally and in the markets we serve there was no change in the composition of the segments and no impact on prior period results of our reporting segments 

business environment and overview 

we employ sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors food service businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we generally do not impose annual minimum purchase volume requirements on our distributors returns from our distributors in 2020 were not material in 2020 2019 or 2018 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

on a consolidated basis there is minimal seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated results of operations typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality in 2021 we expect our results of operations to trend higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half largely due to the effects of higher raw material costs along with the timing of corresponding recovery in our selling prices formula based pricing lags raw material cost movement by approximately six months approximately onethird of foods sales are subject to formula based pricing predominantly within north america and apac formula based pricing does not comprise a significant portion of sales in our protective segment historically net sales in our food segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our protective segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season however the extent and timing of our results of operations may be difficult to predict if significant onetime transactions events or nonrecurring charges were to impact our business cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

throughout 2020 the covid19 pandemic has resulted in anomalies to historical seasonality trends generated by changes in endconsumer behavior such as an increase in ecommerce sales or temporary closures or productivity reductions within our customers operations we cannot predict the impact to the markets we serve or the timing or extent of sales due to the prolonged impact or future spread or worsening of the covid19 pandemic or future restrictions on commercial activities by governmental agencies to limit future spread of the virus in addition to covid19 other factors may also outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs timing of pricing actions foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics automation service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous smaller local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to mitigate the impact on the total company of localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders 

each issue of our outstanding senior notes imposes limitations on our operations and those of specified subsidiaries our credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type including limitations on our indebtedness liens investments restricted payments mergers and acquisitions dispositions of assets transactions with affiliates amendment of documents and sale leasebacks and a covenant specifying a maximum leverage ratio of debt to ebitda we expect continued compliance with our debt covenants including the covenant leverage ratio over the next 12 months see note 14 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

nonus gaap information 

we present financial information that conforms to us gaap we also present financial information that does not conform to us gaap as our management believes it is useful to investors in addition nonus gaap financial measures are used by management to review and analyze our operating performance and along with other data as internal measures for setting annual budgets and forecasts assessing financial performance providing guidance and comparing our financial performance with our peers nonus gaap financial measures also provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the core operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses andor gains which may not occur in each period presented and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and peers more difficult obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts nonus gaap information does not purport to represent any similarly titled us gaap information and is not an indicator of our performance under us gaap investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these nonus gaap financial measures further investors are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to arrive at these nonus gaap financial measures described below 

the nonus gaap financial metrics exclude certain specified items “special items” including restructuring charges and restructuring associated costs certain transaction and other charges related to acquisitions and divestitures gains and losses related to acquisitions and divestitures special tax items or tax benefits collectively “tax special items” and certain other items we evaluate unusual or special items on an individual basis our evaluation of whether to exclude an unusual or special item for purposes of determining our nonus gaap financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item including among other things i its nature ii whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations and iii whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis 

when we present nonus gaap forwardlooking guidance we do not also provide guidance for the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability complexity and low visibility with respect to certain special items including gains and losses on the disposition of businesses 

the ultimate outcome of certain legal or tax proceedings foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the volatile currency market in argentina and other unusual gains and losses these items are uncertain depend on various factors and could be material to our results computed in accordance with us gaap 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude the impact of special items management uses adjusted ebitda as one of many measures to assess the performance of the business additionally adjusted ebitda is the performance metric used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments adjusted ebitda is also a metric used to determine performance in the companys annual incentive plan we do not believe there are estimates underlying the calculation of adjusted ebitda other than those inherent in our us gaap results of operations which would render the use and presentation of adjusted ebitda misleading while the nature and amount of individual special items vary from period to period we believe our calculation of adjusted ebitda is applied consistently to all periods and in conjunction with other us gaap and nonus gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda provides a useful and consistent comparison of our companys performance to other periods 

the following table shows a reconciliation of us gaap net earnings from continuing operations to nonus gaap total company adjusted ebitda from continuing operations 



   

1 includes depreciation and amortization adjustments of 08 million and 24 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the company may also assess performance using adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by net sales we believe that adjusted ebitda margin is a useful measure to assess the profitability of sales made to third parties and the efficiency of our core operations 

adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share “adjusted eps” are also used by the company to measure total company performance adjusted net earnings is defined as us gaap net earnings from continuing operations excluding the impact of special items adjusted eps is defined as our adjusted net earnings divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding we believe that adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps are useful measurements of company performance along with other us gaap and nonus gaap financial measures because they incorporate noncash items of depreciation 

and amortization including stockbased compensation which impact the overall performance and net earnings of our business additionally adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps reflect the impact of our adjusted tax rate and interest expense on a net and per share basis while the nature and amount of individual special items vary from period to period we believe our calculation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps is applied consistently to all periods and in conjunction with other us gaap and nonus gaap financial measures adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps provide a useful and consistent comparison of our companys performance to other periods 

the following table shows a reconciliation of us gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to nonus gaap adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps from continuing operations 



   

1 net earnings per common share are calculated under the twoclass method 

2 includes pretax special items less tax special items and the tax impact of special items as seen in the following calculation of nonus gaap adjusted income tax rate 

adjusted tax rate 

we also present our adjusted income tax rate “adjusted tax rate” the adjusted tax rate is a measure of our us gaap effective tax rate adjusted to exclude the tax impact from the special items that are excluded from our adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps metrics as well as expense or benefit from any special taxes or tax special items the adjusted tax rate is an indicator of the taxes on our core business the tax circumstances and effective tax rate in the specific countries where the special items occur will determine the impact positive or negative to the adjusted tax rate while the nature and amount of tax special items vary from period to period we believe our calculation of the adjusted tax rate is applied consistently to all periods and in conjunction with our us gaap effective income tax rate the adjusted tax rate provides a useful and consistent comparison of the impact that tax expense has on our companys performance 

the following table shows our calculation of the nonus gaap adjusted income tax rate 



   

1 for the year ended december 31 2020 tax special items reflect net benefits from audit settlements and retroactive application of new gilti regulations offset by withholding expense related to cash repatriation initiatives for the year ended december 31 2019 tax special items reflect net benefits from tax optimization initiatives and research and development credits for the year ended december 31 2018 the tax special items included 222 million of expense for the onetime tax on unrepatriated earnings us tax reform transition tax partially offset by the release of valuation allowances associated with tax initiatives 

2 the tax rate used to calculate the tax impact of special items is based on the jurisdiction in which the item was recorded 

organic and constant dollar measures 

in our “net sales by geographic region” “net sales by segment” and in some of the discussions and tables that follow we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information which we define as “constant dollar” and we exclude acquisitions in the first year after closing divestiture activity and the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information which we define as “organic” changes in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation andor acquisition and divestiture activity are nonus gaap financial measures as a worldwide business it is important that we consider the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies nonetheless we cannot control changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently when our management analyzes our financial results including performance metrics such as sales cost of goods sold or selling general and administrative expense to measure the core performance of our business we may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation by translating our current period results at prior period foreign currency exchange rates we also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations as a result our management believes that these presentations are useful internally and may be useful to investors 

refer to these specific tables presented later in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for reconciliations of these nonus gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable us gaap measures 

free cash flow 

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us gaap therefore free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures including certain debt servicing requirements or nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure

executive summary for 2020 

covid19 presented new challenges for sealed airs global operations throughout 2020 while focusing on the health and safety of our employees suppliers and customers globally we continue to operate and serve customers needs with only limited facility closures as a result of initial government orders in response to the pandemic our local regional and corporate crisis management teams remain active and business continuity plans remain in effect 

since march 2020 there has been an imbalance across our endmarkets due to changes in consumer behaviors modifications made by our customers governmental restrictions and other covid19 related factors within our food reporting segment there has been strong demand in retail channels with continuing softness in food service food processors are working hard to meet increased retail demand while balancing labor shortages and social distancing within their operations in protective ecommerce retail and logistics exhibited strength throughout the year due to shifts in consumer behavior the growth in ecommerce logistics and fulfillment was offset by industrial endmarkets which were soft during the year 

in 2020 we launched our see automation solutions strategy we seek to solve our customers’ automation needs and provide a differentiated value proposition to our customers including automated equipment services and materials with see 

automation we are taking an integrated solutions approach and looking for opportunities to help customers eliminate waste simplify processes remove people from harms way and drive touchless operations across both our segments capitalintensive equipment and automated solutions were negatively impacted during the first half of 2020 by the slowdown on capital expenditures by our customers as well as order and installation delays due to social distancing measures however our equipment and automated solutions business increased in the second half of 2020 as customers resumed essential purchases and began to invest in automation 

we continue to execute our reinvent see business transformation focused on the 4ps sm  performance people products process and sustainability during the year reinvent see delivered incremental adjusted ebitda benefits of 118 million the full year benefits to adjusted ebitda from reinvent see were partially offset by negative foreign currency impacts and higher expenses associated with labor inflation incentive compensation and investments in the business we expect the reinvent see business transformation to deliver incremental cost benefits to adjusted ebitda of approximately 65 million in 2021 compared to 2020 we also expect that the capabilities and governance processes established through the reinvent see business transformation will transition well into our see operating model and an ongoing continuous improvement system and enable us to generate additional savings and growth opportunities beyond 2021 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred approximately 31 million or 23 million net of tax in restructuring and restructuring associated charges primarily related to our reinvent see business transformation initiatives cash payments including restructuring payments related to our reinvent see business transformation and legacy programs were 74 million see note 12 “restructuring activities” for additional details regarding each of the company’s restructuring programs 

in 2020 the companys net sales increased 112 million or 2 to 4903 million primarily driven by incremental contributions from the 2019 acquisition of automated packaging systems foreign currency had a negative impact on net sales of 82 million or 2 foods net sales decreased 55 million or 2 in 2020 the decrease was driven by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency excluding currency headwinds food net sales increased 27 million or 1 on favorable volume and pricing trends and contributions from two small acquisitions made in 2019 in protective net sales increased 167 million or 9 including 166 million from the automated packaging systems acquisition noted above see note 3 “revenue recognition contracts with customers” for additional details regarding revenue recognition 

impact of covid19 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” outbreak as a global pandemic additionally many international heads of state including the president of the united states declared the covid19 outbreak to be a national emergency in their respective countries in response to these declarations and the rapid spread of covid19 across many countries governmental agencies around the world including federal state and local governments in the us implemented varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activities to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness these measures as well as future measures had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the global economy additionally the virus continues to spread in some parts of the world including regions of the us 

we continue to monitor the impact that covid19 has on all aspects of our business and geographies including the impact on our employees customers suppliers business partners and distribution channels our crisis management teams which are comprised of cross functional and regional leaders continue to assess the evolving situation and implement business continuity plans at both the regional and headquarter levels see part i item 1a “risk factors” above for additional risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

we cannot predict the impact on our operations or markets we serve due to the future spread or worsening of the covid19 pandemic or future restrictions on commercial activities by governmental agencies to limit the spread of the virus 

employee health and safety and business continuity 

the health and safety of sealed air’s employees suppliers and customers globally continues to be the company’s top priority safety measures remain in place at sealed air sites such as enhanced cleaning procedures employee temperature checks use of personal protective equipment for locationdependent workers social distancing measures within operating sites remote work arrangements for nonlocation dependent employees visitor access restrictions and limitations on travel 

in remote working environments we continue our efforts to mitigate information technology risks including failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks and security breaches of our networks or systems additionally we continue to execute all activities related to our internal control over financial 

reporting in our remote environment there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended december 31 2020 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

supply chain and operations 

sealed airs global operations continue to operate and serve customers needs we experienced limited facility closures in 2020 as a result of initial government orders in response to the pandemic additionally in some jurisdictions we have at times reduced production capacity due to local social distancing requirements which limit the number of employees at any given time in our facilities these instances have not had a material impact on our operations to date we continue to closely monitor our locationdependent operations 

the impact of covid19 has resulted in approximately 16 million in unanticipated net expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 these costs included additional personal protective gear cleaning and other health and hygiene supplies and related expenses higher employment costs related to covid19 and incremental freight due to sourcing changes along with other higher manufacturing related costs net of direct government assistance 

the health of our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs in our manufacturing facilities distribution of our products and other critical functions are key to our operations 

markets we serve 

early during the implementation of initial commercial and social restrictions due to the pandemic employees within “food and agriculture” and “transportation and logistics” sectors including their respective supply chains such as packaging material providers were deemed “essential critical infrastructure workers” by the us department of homeland security and similarly by other international governmental agencies these designations covered the majority of sealed air employees and allowed us to continue operations in order to serve our customers 

some sectors such as industrial goods capitalintensive equipment and parts of the food industry including food service and restaurants have experienced adverse impacts as a result of the pandemic early in the pandemic sales of capitalintensive equipment that serves food market segments was negatively impacted due to customers reevaluation of investments and delays due to restrictions on thirdparty visitors and installations in light of current social distancing measures however our equipment solutions business increased in the second half of the year as customers began to resume essential investments some endsegments of our business experienced increased demand from shifts in consumer behavior including ecommerce and fulfillment within our protective segment 

liquidity and financial position 

as of december 31 2020 sealed air had approximately 17 billion of liquidity available comprised of 549 million in cash and 1146 million of undrawn committed credit facilities the company does not have longterm debt maturing until august 2022 see note 10 “accounts receivable securitization programs” and note 14 “debt and credit facilities” for further details

foreign currency translation impact on consolidated financial results 

since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated financial results into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our financial results from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact historically the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro the australian dollar the mexican peso the british pound the canadian dollar the new zealand dollar the brazilian real and the chinese renminbi 

the following table presents the approximate favorable or unfavorable impact foreign currency translation had on certain of our consolidated financial results   



net sales by geographic region

protective 

2020 compared with 2019 

as reported net sales increased 167 million or 9 in 2020 compared with 2019 the impact of foreign currency translation during the year was negligible the increase in sales in 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to the following 

• the contribution of 166 million in sales from the automated packaging systems acquisition through july 2020 which represents the 12 month anniversary of the acquisition and 

• higher volume of 16 million primarily in north america and apac due to increased demand in ecommerce fulfillment and automated equipment partially offset by global softness in industrial endmarkets due to covid19

as reported net sales increased 86 million or 5 in 2019 compared with 2018 on a constant dollar basis net sales increased 116 million or 6 in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the following 

• 178 million increase in sales due to acquisitions of automated packaging systems and afp inc in the case of afp inc through the first anniversary of the 2018 acquisition and 

• favorable price of 10 million primarily in north america 

this was partially offset by

2019 compared with 2018 

as reported sga expenses increased 133 million or 17 in 2019 as compared to 2018 sga expenses were impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 16 million on a constant dollar basis sga expenses increased approximately 150 million or 19 the increase in sga expenses is a result of 60 million in restructuring associated charges primarily related to our reinvent see business transformation initiatives the 59 million charge associated with the novipax settlement incremental sga expense from recent acquisitions including automated packaging systems and afp of 39 million and 11 million due to higher incentive compensation expense restructuring associated charges described above primarily relate to fees paid to thirdparty consultants in support of our reinvent see business transformation and costs related to property consolidations resulting from reinvent see these expenses were partially offset by benefits attributable to our reinvent see business transformation initiatives 

amortization expense of intangible assets acquired 

amortization expense of intangible assets acquired for the years ended december 31 were as follows 



the increase in amortization expense of intangibles for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to an increase in amortization for capitalized software and the full year impact of intangible amortization associated with the acquisition of automated packaging systems in august 2019 

the increase in amortization expense of intangibles for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily related to the acquisition of automated packaging systems the most significant impact on year over year increase in amortization expense was backlog acquired in the automated packaging systems purchase which was amortized over 5 months the company also acquired intangibles related to technology trademarks and tradenames and customer relationships from automated packaging systems

see note 12 “restructuring activities” for additional details regarding the company’s restructuring programs discussed below 

in december 2018 the sealed air board of directors approved a threeyear restructuring program related to the reinvent see business transformation 

sealed air has combined the program associated with the reinvent see business transformation with its previously existing restructuring program as combined “program” that was largely related to the elimination of stranded costs following the sale of diversey for the year ended december 31 2020 the program generated incremental cost benefits of 118 million current year benefits include 104 million related to reductions in operating costs 33 million of which is related to restructuring actions and 14 million in benefits related to actions impacting pricecost spread since the inception of the program in 2018 we expect the total cost benefits to approximate 355 million by the end of 2021 which implies additional expected cost benefits of approximately 65 million in 2021 we expect the program spend for the full year 2021 to be in the range of 25 million and 45 million 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded restructuring expense of 11 million this was primarily incurred during the second quarter of 2020 during the fourth quarter of 2020 the company recorded net restructuring income of 1 million which was primarily driven by the reversal of headcountreduction accruals incurred earlier in the year throughout the year restructuring expense was highest in north america which comprised 8 million of the full year expense we also recorded 20 million in restructuring associated costs for the year ended december 31 2020 restructuring associated costs primarily relate to fees paid to thirdparty consultants in support of the reinvent see business transformation 

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to the program described above are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later than expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending benefits and cost synergies 

interest expense net 

interest expense net includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt as well as the net impact of capitalized interest interest income the effects of terminated interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs and credit facility fees bond discounts and terminated treasury locks

other income expense net 

equity investments 

we hold strategic investments in other companies these investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative described in asc 321 for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values these investments are measured at cost less impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer we do not exercise significant influence over these companies for the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded an increase in the fair value of these investments of 15 million the increase in fair value was directly related to an additional round of equity issuance from one investee issued during the fourth quarter 2020 we concluded this was an observable price change in an orderly transaction for a similar investment of the same issuer see note 16 fair value measurements equity investments and other financial instruments for further details 

brazil tax credits

loss on debt redemption 

in november 2019 sealed air issued 425 million of 400 senior notes due december 2027 the proceeds were used to repurchase 425 million 650 senior notes due december 2020 we recognized a 16 million pretax loss on the transaction the loss was primarily driven by the breakage fee on the bond redemption see note 14 debt and credit facilities for further details 

see note 23 “other income expense net” for the components of other income expense net 

income taxes 

the table below shows our effective income tax rate “etr” 

   

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 was 227 the difference between the companys effective income tax rate and the us statutory rate of 21 related primarily to state income tax expense and foreign earnings subject to higher tax rates offset by the benefit from global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” regulations issued by the irs in 2020 research credits and a reduction in valuation allowance due to increased profitability in emea 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 was 207 the difference between the companys effective income tax rate and the us statutory rate of 21 related primarily to benefits related to tax optimization initiatives associated with the reinvent see business transformation and restructuring activities prior year research credits and a reduction in valuation allowance offset by expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and the gilti provisions 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 was 672 the 2018 effective tax rate includes the benefit of a lower us corporate income tax rate of 21 and also reflects 222 million of expense for tax related to the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of us subsidiaries under tcja “transition tax” the difference between the company’s effective income tax rate and the us statutory rate of 21 related primarily to the transition tax associated with tcja the gilti provisions enacted as part of tcja state income taxes and foreign earnings subject to higher tax rates offset by tax benefit for reduction in valuation allowance related to tax initiatives 

our effective income tax rate depends upon the realization of our net deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets related to accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards tax credits employee benefit items intangibles and other items 

the irs completed its field examination of our us federal income tax returns for the years 2011 through 2014 in the third quarter of 2020 as previously disclosed the irs has proposed to disallow for the 2014 taxable year the entirety of the deduction of the approximately 149 billion in settlement payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement as defined in note 20 “commitments and contingencies” and the resulting reduction of our us federal tax liability by approximately 525 million we continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed disallowance and have filed a protest with the irs although we expected to enter the irs administrative appeals process in late 2020 or early 2021 upon receipt of our protest the irs determined that it needed additional information before transferring the matter to the irs administrative appeals process we are currently responding to requests for further information from the irs and at this time cannot predict when we will enter the irs administrative appeals process when such process will conclude or the outcome of such process it is possible that future developments in this matter could have a material impact on the uncertain tax position balances and results of operations including cash flows within the next twelve months 

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences the future income from existing temporary differences and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reduce those valuation allowances we reported a net increase in our valuation allowance for the year ended december 31 2020 of 10 million primarily related to foreign net operating losses see note 19 “income taxes” for additional information 

we reported a net benefit for unrecognized tax benefits in the year ended december 31 2020 of 1 million primarily related to north america tax positions interest and penalties on tax assessments are included in income tax expense 

net earnings from continuing operations 

net earnings from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 are included in the table below

gain loss on sale of discontinued operations net of tax 

gain loss on sale of discontinued operations net of tax for the years ended december 31 are included in the table below 

during 2020 we recorded a net gain of 19 million on the sale of discontinued operations the gain primarily relates to changes in balance sheet positions associated with the settlement and release reached with diversey related to a clawback claim connected with the sale of the business see note 20 “commitments and contingencies” for additional information 

during 2019 we recorded a net loss of 31 million on sale of discontinued operations the loss relates primarily to changes in balance sheet positions associated with the sale of diversey including taxrelated indemnification reserves and other receivable or payable positions arising from the sale 

during 2018 we recorded an additional net gain on the sale of diversey of 43 million which was related to the final net working capital settlement as well as the release of tax indemnity reserves upon expiration of the statute of limitations 

adjusted ebitda by segment 

the company evaluates performance of the reportable segments based on the results of each segment the performance metric used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments is adjusted ebitda we allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments although depreciation and amortization are not included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda we also allocate and disclose restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment although it is not included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda since restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are categorized as special items the accounting policies of the reportable segments and corporate are the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements 

see “nonus gaap information” for a reconciliation of us gaap net earnings from continuing operations to nonus gaap total company adjusted ebitda from continuing operations 



   

the following is a discussion of the factors that contributed to the change in adjusted ebitda by segment in the year ended december 31 as compared with the prior year 

food 

2020 compared with 2019 

on a reported basis adjusted ebitda increased 18 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 adjusted ebitda was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 20 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda increased 38 million or 6 in 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 primarily due to the impact of 

• reinvent see benefits of 79 million driven by actions reducing operating costs by 69 million including restructuring savings of 21 million and improvements to pricecost spread of 10 million and 

• lower input costs resulting in favorable pricecost of 19 million 

these increases were partially offset by 

• higher operating costs of 49 million including labor inflation higher incentive compensation and investments in the business and 

• unfavorable product mix of 11 million 

2019 compared with 2018 

on a reported basis adjusted ebitda increased 52 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 adjusted ebitda was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 21 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda increased 73 million or 13 in 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 primarily due to the impact of 

• reinvent see benefits of 109 million driven by actions reducing operating costs by 89 million including restructuring savings of 39 million and improvements to price cost spread of 20 million 

• other pricecost spread drivers of 20 million and 

• business growth including 10 million from higher volume 

these increases were partially offset by 

• higher operating costs of 66 million including labor inflation higher incentive compensation investments in the business and other manufacturing costs 

protective 

2020 compared with 2019 

on a reported basis adjusted ebitda increased 58 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 adjusted ebitda was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 1 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda increased 57 million or 16 in 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 primarily due to the impact of 

• reinvent see benefits of 39 million driven by actions reducing operating costs of 34 million including restructuring savings of 12 million and improvements to price cost spread of 5 million 

• contributions of 31 million from seven months of incremental adjusted ebitda from the automated packaging systems acquisition and 

• the prior year impact of a 7 million noncash inventory stepup charge associated with the automated packaging systems acquisition 

these increases were partially offset by 

• higher operating costs of 12 million including labor inflation higher incentive compensation expense and investments in the business 

• unfavorable pricecost spread of 5 million and 

• unfavorable product mix of 3 million 

2019 compared with 2018 

on a reported basis adjusted ebitda increased 31 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 adjusted ebitda was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 6 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda increased 37 million or 12 in 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 primarily due to the impact of 

• reinvent see benefits of 59 million driven by actions reducing operating costs of 42 million including restructuring savings of 28 million and improvements to price cost spread of 17 million 

• other price cost spread drivers of 26 million and 

• contributions from recent acquisitions of 14 million which is net of the 7 million onetime noncash inventory stepup charge associated with the automated packaging systems acquisition 

these increases were partially offset by 

• higher operating costs of approximately 34 million including labor inflation higher incentive compensation expense other manufacturing costs and investment in the business and 

• lower volume of 28 million primarily driven by macroeconomic headwinds particularly in the industrial sector 

corporate 

2020 compared with 2019 

corporate expenses decreased by 10 million on an as reported basis and 7 million on a constant dollar basis as compared with the same period in 2019 primarily driven by currency transaction gains in 2020 compared to currency transaction losses in 2019 

2019 compared with 2018 

corporate expenses increased by 8 million on an as reported basis and 9 million on a constant dollar basis as compared with the same period in 2018 primarily driven by currency transaction losses associated with emerging market currencies strengthening against the us dollar 

liquidity and capital resources 

principal sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our senior secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses investments in working capital capital expenditures interest taxes stock repurchases dividends debt obligations restructuring expenses and other longterm liabilities we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months 

as of december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 549 million of which approximately 304 million or 55 was located outside of the us as of december 31 2020 we had an immaterial amount of cash trapped outside of the us we believe our us cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to us borrowers are sufficient to fund our us operating requirements and capital expenditures current debt obligations and dividends the company does not expect that in the near term cash located outside of the us will be needed to satisfy its obligations dividends and other demands for cash in the us 

material commitments and contingencies 

settlement agreement tax deduction 

the information set forth in note 20 “commitments and contingencies” under the caption “settlement agreement tax deduction” is incorporated herein by reference 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2021 and future years

3 refer to note 4 “leases” of the notes for detail related to contractual obligations related to finance and operating leases 

4 obligations related to defined benefit pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans have been excluded from the table above due to factors such as the retirement of employees the performance of plan assets and economic and actuarial assumptions as it is not reasonably possible to estimate when these obligations will become due refer to note 17 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” and note 18 “other postemployment benefits and other employee benefit plans” for additional information related to these plans 

other principal contractual obligations   

sealed air has other principal contractual obligations which include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy assumed in the normal course of business these obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase we may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and as a result use additional cash the amounts included in the 

table above represent estimates of the minimum amounts we are obligated to pay or reasonably likely to pay under these agreements see note 20 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes for additional information 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2020 we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of 381 million given the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with some of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we are not able to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority see note 19 “income taxes” of the notes for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have reviewed our offbalance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

income tax payments 

we expect tax payments to be approximately 111 million in 2021 future payments are uncertain and dependent on a number of factors including the amount of future taxable income and the results of ongoing audits by various taxing authorities including the irs 

contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our us and our nonus employees we currently expect our contributions to these plans to be approximately 18 million in 2021 additionally we expect benefits related to our defined benefit pension plan paid directly by the company to be 4 million in 2021 future contributions are uncertain and rely on a number of factors including performance of underlying assets future cash out flows of the plans actuarial assumptions and funding discussions with boards charged with governance for some of our international plans refer to note 17 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for additional information related to these plans 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents 



see “analysis of historical cash flow” below 

accounts receivable securitization programs 

at december 31 2020 we had 146 million available to us and no outstanding borrowings under our us and european accounts receivable securitization programs at december 31 2019 we had 127 million available to us and no outstanding borrowings under the such programs 

our trade receivable securitization programs represent borrowings secured by outstanding customer receivables therefore the use and repayment of borrowings under such programs are classified as a financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not recognize the cash flow within operating activities until the underlying invoices have been paid by our customer the trade receivables that served as collateral for these borrowings are reclassified from trade receivables net to prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets see note 10 “accounts receivable securitization programs” for further details 

accounts receivable factoring agreements 

we account for our participation in our customers supply chain financing arrangements and our trade receivable factoring program in accordance with asc 860 which allows the ownership transfer of accounts receivable to qualify for sale treatment when the appropriate criteria are met as such the company excludes the balances sold under such programs from trade receivables net on the consolidated balance sheets we recognize cash flow from operating activities at the point the receivables are sold under such programs see note 11 “accounts receivable factoring agreements” for further details 

gross amounts received under these programs for the year ended december 31 2020 were 466 million of which 157 million was received in the fourth quarter gross amounts received under these programs for the year ended december 31 2019 were 351 million of which 105 million was received in the fourth quarter if these programs had not been in effect for the year ended december 31 2020 we would have been required to collect the invoice amounts directly from the relevant customers in accordance with the agreed payment terms approximately 114 million in incremental trade receivables would have been outstanding at december 31 2020 if collection on such invoice amounts were made directly from our customers on the invoice due date and not through our customers supply chain financing arrangements or our factoring program 

the increase in gross amounts factored under these programs from 2019 to 2020 primarily relates to usage of our trade receivable factoring program which was implemented late in 2019 and utilized throughout 2020 during the fourth quarter 2020 we increased the maximum amount available to be sold under that factoring program from 20 million per month to 35 million per month 

payments received through customers supply chain financing arrangements tend to be higher in the fourth quarter the increased use of our trade receivable factoring program had a favorable impact on cash provided by operating activities during the year 

lines of credit 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had a 1 billion revolving credit facility we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility at december 31 2020 and 89 million of outstanding borrowings under the facility at december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had 7 million and 10 million respectively available under various lines of credit extended to our subsidiaries see note 14 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

libor phase out 

in july 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 an alternative to libor has been contemplated in many of our liborlinked instruments and other financial obligations including our senior secured credit facility we do not expect the phaseout of libor to have a material disruption or impact on our financing or liquidity in march 2020 the fasb issued asu 202004 to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform however neither the libor phase out or the recently issued asu is expected to have a material impact on the company 

covenants 

at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations as discussed in “covenants” within note 14 “debt and credit facilities” as a result of our acquisition of automated packaging systems the maximum covenant leverage ratio of debt to ebitda under our senior secured credit facility was temporarily increased to 500 to 100 through september 30 2020 the maximum covenant leverage ratio has returned to 450 to 100 after september 30 2020 at 

december 31 2020 our leverage ratio of debt to ebitda as calculated under the covenant was 280 to 100 we expect to be in continued compliance with our debt covenants including the covenant leverage ratio over the next 12 months 

see “covenants” in note 14 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

supply chain financing programs 

as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our working capital and improve our cash flow we work with suppliers to optimize our purchasing terms and conditions including extending payment terms we also facilitate a voluntary supply chain financing program to provide some of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us our accounts payables to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions these programs are administered by participating financial institutions should the supplier choose to participate in the program it will receive payment from the financial institution in advance of agreed payment terms our responsibility is limited to making payments to the respective financial institutions on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier the range of payment terms is consistent regardless of a vendors participation in the program we monitor our days payable outstanding relative to our peers and industry trends in order to assess our conclusion that these programs continue to be trade payable programs and not indicative of borrowing arrangements the liabilities continue to be presented as trade payables in our consolidated balance sheets until they are paid and they are reflected as cash flows from operating activities when settled 

as of december 31 2020 our accounts payable balance included 149 million related to invoices from suppliers participating in the programs as of december 31 2019 our accounts payable balance included 157 million related to invoices from suppliers participating in the programs the cumulative amounts settled through the supply chain financing programs for the year ended december 31 2020 were 423 million these programs did not significantly improve our cash provided by operating activities or free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 

debt ratings 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency 

   

these credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade with the exception of the baa3 and bbb senior secured credit facility rating from moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s respectively which are classified as investment grade if our credit ratings are downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

outstanding indebtedness 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table 





1 amounts are net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs of 20 million and 25 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

see note 14 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

analysis of historical cash flow 

the following table shows the changes in our consolidated statements of cash flows in the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us gaap therefore free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures including certain debt servicing requirements or nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure we historically have generated the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year below are the details of free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 





1 free cash flow was 311 million in 2018 excluding the payment of charges related to the sale of diversey of 52 million 

operating activities 

2020 vs 2019 

net cash provided by operating activities improved by 226 million in the current year this was primarily the result of stronger net earnings including noncash add backs in 2020 compared to 2019 

net earnings were 503 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 263 million for the year ended december 31 2019 

noncash add backs to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities were 307 million in 2020 compared to 221 million in 2019 the increase in noncash add backs was primarily driven by the change in deferred tax balances generating 137 million year over year depreciation and amortization increased 23 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to amortization of intangibles for capitalized software and the full year impact of intangible amortization from our acquisition of automated packaging systems these noncash addbacks were partially offset by the noncash gain on sale of businesses which was 19 million in 2020 compared to a loss of 31 million in 2019 representing a change of 50 million the increase in noncash add backs in the current year were also partially offset by a gain on an equity investment of 15 million in 2020 

the year over year improvement in cash provided by operating activities was also due to decreased cash payments made for our reinvent see business transformation including restructuring and restructuring associated payments which were 74 million in 2020 compared to 91 million in 2019 cash payments related to restructuring and restructuring associated activities are expected to continue to decline in 2021 

working capital which represents cash generated by trade receivables inventories and accounts payable represented a source of cash of 3 million in 2020 compared to 14 million in 2019 cash generation from working capital in 2020 declined primarily due to an increase in cash used for inventory driven by a purposeful build in 2020 for contingency planning against the risk of raw material shortages or supply disruptions resulting from the covid19 pandemic cash generated from trade receivables benefited from improved days sales outstanding resulting partially from the increased use of our trade receivable factoring program the year over year changes in accounts payable were largely due to the timing of payments to suppliers cash generated from customer advance payments increased 8 million as the company increased automation and equipment sales 

as of december 31 2020 we had repaid the vast majority of us payroll taxes deferred earlier in 2020 under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” with only 03 million yet to be remitted at yearend 

2019 vs 2018 

net cash provided by operating activities improved by 83 million in 2019 compared to 2018 this was primarily the result of stronger net earnings including noncash add backs improved cash provided by working capital and lower cash tax payments in 2019 compared to 2018 

net earnings were 263 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 193 million for the year ended december 31 2018 noncash add backs to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities were 221 million in 2019 compared to 182 million in 2018 the increase was primarily driven by 20 million of higher depreciation and amortization due to amortization of intangibles acquired from automated packaging systems as well as a noncash loss recorded from the sale of discontinued operations of 31 million 

working capital represented a source of cash of 14 million in 2019 compared to a use of cash of 20 million in 2018 cash generation from working capital in 2019 was driven by improvements in accounts receivables primarily on strengthened collections and cash generated from organic inventory reduction which excludes the change in balance resulting from the opening balance sheet acquired in acquisitions made this year these improvements were slightly offset by a use of cash in accounts payable in 2019 of 37 million which compares to a source of cash of 43 million in 2018 the change in cash provided byused in accounts payable primarily represents timing of payments as well as the benefits received in prior years of improvements to working capital 

cash tax payments in 2019 were 95 million compared to 155 million in 2018 the improvement was partially the result of onetime items benefiting cash taxes paid in the year including the novipax settlement and benefits from the purchase of automated packaging systems 

the year over year improvements were partially offset by cash payments made for our reinvent see business transformation including restructuring and restructuring associated payments of 91 million in 2019 compared to 12 million in 2018 the onetime cash outflow in 2019 related to the novipax settlement payment was largely offset by a onetime payment in lieu of certain future royalty payments for patents made in 2018 

investing activities 

2020 vs 2019 

net cash used in investing activities was 160 million in 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 666 million in 2019 the change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to prior year business acquisitions activity of 454 million predominately related to the automated packaging systems acquisition a favorable purchase price adjustment of 4 million was received during the first quarter 2020 related to the automated packaging systems acquisition 

in 2019 the company invested in cash deposits with maturities greater than 90 days marketable securities which matured in 2020 and then converted back into a cash equivalent generating a net favorable impact to investing activities of 26 million in 2020 compared to 2019 

proceeds related to the sale of businesses and property increased 15 million compared to 2019 resulting from the sale of two discrete properties in emea generating 6 million cash inflow during 2020 as well as the impact of recoveries of tax refund amounts related to diversey entities which were owed to us 

during 2020 we made a total investment of 8 million in an equity holding this is classified as an investing cash flow activity based on our strategic investment thesis of anticipated partnership in increasing plastic circularity see note 16 “fair value measurements equity investments and other financial instruments” for more information on our equity investments 

2019 vs 2018 

net cash used in investing activities was 666 million in 2019 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 267 million in 2018 the change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in business acquisitions activity of 384 million primarily due to the acquisition of automated packaging systems offset by the cash outflow for the purchase of afp in 2018 and an increase in capital expenditures of 21 million driven by increased investment to drive growth and improve cost productivity 

financing activities 

2020 vs 2019 

net cash used in financing activities was 262 million in 2020 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 140 million in 2019 the change in net cash used in provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowing activity in 2019 specifically in 2019 we received the proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 895 million including the 475 million on the term loan a due 2022 and the issuance of 425 million of 400 of senior notes which were partially offset by the 425 million repurchase of the 650 senior notes lower repayments of shortterm borrowings of 29 million were primarily due to higher payments on our revolving credit facility in 2019 compared to 2020 at december 31 2020 we had no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility 

cash outlay for share repurchases were 33 million in 2020 compared to 67 million in 2019 

we continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy to determine the best use of cash including decisions regarding share repurchases investments in growth and operational efficiency acquisitions and maintaining our debtleverage ratio 

2019 vs 2018 

net cash provided by financing activities was 140 million in 2019 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 478 million in 2018 the change in net cash provided by used in in financing activities was primarily due to borrowing activity in 2019 specifically we received the proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 895 million including the term loan a due 2022 of 475 million to fund the purchase of automated packaging systems and the issuance of 425 million of 400 of senior notes due 2027 which was partially offset by the 425 million repurchase of the 650 senior notes due 2020 shortterm borrowings was a use of cash in 2019 compared to a source of cash in 2018 representing a net change 352 million year over year this was driven by decrease in borrowings under the european accounts receivable securitization program and our revolving credit facility in 2019 compared to an increase of facility use in 2018 additionally share repurchases were 515 million lower in 2019 compared to 2018 

changes in working capital   

   

the 386 million or 302 increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 286 million and repayment of shortterm borrowings primarily the revolving credit facility of 92 million 

net working capital balances of trade receivables plus inventory less accounts payable were relatively consistent with the prior year the increase in inventory of 26 million was primarily due to a purposeful inventory build in the second quarter 2020 for contingency planning against the risk of raw material shortages or supply disruptions this build was partially offset 

by a higher accounts payable balance at yearend overall given the consistency of the working capital balances of trade receivables inventory and accounts payable coupled with the increase in sales and cost of goods sold compared to 2019 our cash conversion cycle days inventory outstanding plus days sales outstanding less days payable outstanding improved in 2020 relative to 2019 

changes in stockholders’ equity deficit 

the 369 million increase in stockholders’ equity in 2020 compared with 2019 was due to 

• net earnings of 503 million 

• the effect of sharebased incentive compensation of 31 million which includes the impact of our sharebased compensation expense as well as the impact of shares netting to cover the employee tax withholding amounts 

• stock issued for profit sharing contribution paid in stock of 24 million and 

• cumulative translation adjustment of 7 million 

these increases were partially offset by 

• dividends paid on our common stock and dividend equivalent accruals related to unvested equity awards of 101 million 

• a net increase in shares held in treasury of 35 million due to the repurchases of common stock 

• unrealized losses on derivative instruments of 35 million and 

• a net increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 26 million on unrecognized pension items due primarily to market conditions impacting actuarial assumptions as of our annual pension valuation 

we repurchased approximately 09 million shares of our common stock during the year ended december 31 2020 for 35 million see note 21 “stockholders’ equity deficit” for further details

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel thirdparty experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of trade receivables as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have historically adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or for which additional information has been provided on which to review the probability and measurability of outcomes and will continue to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment the impairment model is a two step test under which we first calculate the recoverability of the carrying value by comparing the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group including its estimated residual value to the carrying amount if the cash flows associated with the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value we would perform a fair value assessment of the asset or asset group if the carrying amount is found to be greater than the fair value we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 we identified a triggering event related to our foam fabrication producing asset group within our protective segment this asset group generates cash flows which were identified for the purpose of the impairment test at the lowest level based on the interdependency of revenue and shared cost structure in accordance with asc 360 the 

asset groups primary asset was determined to be the intangible asset of customer relationships which has a remaining useful life of approximately 12 years the triggering event was related to the finalization of the upcoming years financial projections and budget which indicated shortterm deterioration in the profitability of the specific asset groups north american operations the shortterm deterioration is driven in part by a decrease in expected sales of a particular customer within the region the decline in expected performance identified as a triggering event is not expected to be material to the overall segment or total company we performed a quantitative analysis of the recoverability of the net asset group and determined that the assets were not impaired the estimated future cash flows including the residual value of the asset group were 29 greater than the carrying value of net assets the asset group tested for impairment had a net carrying value of 120 million as of the date of testing of which 48 million was attributable to intangible assets key assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amount of the asset group were expected future sales performance and efficiency and cost improvements resulting in cash flow growth over the remaining useful life of the primary asset we believe the assumptions utilized in the projections are appropriate and inline with industry and gdp growth estimates as part of our analysis we performed a sensitivity analysis on the sales and future cash flow assumptions the sensitivities led us to the same conclusion that the carrying value of the asset group was recoverable 

for indefinite–lived intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate we recorded no impairment to indefinite lived assets in the current year 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment  the “component” level  discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

in our annual impairment review we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in a qualitative assessment we would consider the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general economic conditions industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulatory and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation and events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the carrying value of net assets 

if the results of our qualitative assessment indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we are required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 

alternatively if an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed we may perform a quantitative assessment under the quantitative assessment we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value there would be no indication of impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit were less than the carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

under the quantitative assessment we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value fair value computed by these models is arrived at using a number of factors and inputs there are inherent uncertainties however related to fair value models the inputs and our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 

we believe the most significant inputs in our quantitative assessment include 

• forecasted future operating results on an annual basis the company prepares annual and mediumterm financial projections these projections are based on input from the companys leadership strategy commercial leadership and finance teams and presented to our board of directors annually influences on this years forecasted financial information and the fair value model include the impact of planned strategic initiatives the continued integration of recent acquisitions including automated packaging systems 

continuous improvement derived from reinvent see business transformation initiatives and overall market conditions 

• discount rate our thirdparty valuation specialists provide inputs into managements determination of the discount rate the rate is dependent on a number of underlying assumptions the most impactful of which are the riskfree rate tax rate equity risk premium debt to equity ratio and pretax cost of debt 

• longterm growth rate longterm growth rates are applied to the terminal year of our cash flow valuation approach the longterm growth rates are tied to growth rates we expect to achieve beyond the years for which we have forecasted operating results we also consider external benchmarks including forecasted longterm gdp growth and other data points which we believe are applicable to our industry and the composition of our global operations 

the company performed a quantitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of october 1 2020 we believe it is appropriate to periodically perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment test even if qualitative considerations do not indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value the periodic and timely calculation of the quantitative assessment provides better support for our qualitative assessments other factors that contributed to our decision to perform a quantitative test included the market volatility resulting from the covid19 pandemic the indicators of impairment identified with respect to a specific subset of our other longlived assets as described above and our continued integration of recent acquisitions including automated packaging systems which is contained within our protective reporting unit 

based on our quantitative assessment we believe the fair value of each of our reporting units sufficiently exceed the carrying values as part of our analysis we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and longterm growth rate assumptions the sensitivities led us to the same conclusion that no impairment exists 

the company also assesses its goodwill for impairment from time to time when warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding individual reporting units subsequent to our annual reporting period we continued to assess whether there were changes in facts or circumstances that would lead us to believe goodwill may be impaired no indication of goodwill impairment has been identified subsequent to our annual testing date 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we also performed a quantitative assessment for our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018 we performed a qualitative assessment no indication of goodwill impairment was identified in either 2019 or 2018 

see note 9 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets net” for details of our goodwill balances as of 2020 2019 and 2018 and additional information related to the quantitative assessment performed in 2020 

pensions 

for a number of our current and former us and international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year we believe the most significant assumptions are the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected future rate of return on plan assets we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life or expected life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 

at december 31 2020 the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plan was 202 million and the total benefit income for the year ended december 31 2020 was 2 million at december 31 2020 the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 783 million and the total benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2020 was 3 million the employer service cost of our pension plans is charged to cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses all other components of benefits expense are recorded to other income expense net 

material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2020 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2021 





income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carryforwards and tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized on the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 19 “income taxes” for further discussion 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2020 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps collars or options 

the information set forth in note 15 “derivatives and hedging activities” under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 16 “fair value measurements equity investments and other financial instruments” for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 42 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2020 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

argentina 

economic events in argentina including the default on some of its international debt obligations which have subsequently been renegotiated exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks despite some recent debt restructuring fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the argentine peso continue to impact our financial results as of july 1 2018 argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we recognized 5 million of net foreign currency exchange losses in foreign currency exchange loss due to highly inflationary economies on the consolidated statements of operations related to the designation of argentina as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” for additional information as of december 31 2020 1 of our consolidated net sales were derived from our products sold in argentina and net assets include 10 million of cash and cash equivalents domiciled in argentina also as of december 31 2020 our argentina subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 24 million 

russia 

the us and the european union eu have imposed sanctions on various sectors of the russian economy and on transactions with certain russian nationals and entities russia has also announced economic sanctions against the us and other nations that include a ban on imports of certain products these sanctions are not expected to have a material impact on our business as much of the operations in russia support local production however they may limit the amount of future business the company does with customers involved in activities in russia as of december 31 2020 we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact to our 2021 results of operations as of december 31 2020 2 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into russia and net assets include 10 million of cash and cash equivalents domiciled in russia also as of december 31 2020 our russia subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 39 million 

brazil 

recent economic events in brazil including changes in the benchmark interest rate set by the brazilian central bank have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks however as of december 31 2020 we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2021 results of operations as of december 31 2020 2 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into brazil and net assets include 22 million of cash and cash equivalents also as of december 31 2020 our brazil subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 58 million 

united kingdom 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom uk exited the european union referred to as brexit the uk agreed to abide by eu rules during a transition period through december 31 2020 prior to the end of the transition period the uk and the european union reached a deal related to future trade customs and mobility among other topics the deal generally provided continued free trade between the two parties though increased checks and custom declarations the final brexit deal may create additional effort related to our supply chain and shipping goods from the uk over the last two years we have deployed a crossfunctional team to develop and implement changes to our operating model and legal entity structure to efficiently address challenges that may arise from brexit 

as of december 31 2020 3 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into the uk which is consistent with the prior year net assets in the uk include 4 million of cash and cash equivalents and 15 million in inventory also as of december 31 2020 our uk subsidiaries had cumulative translation adjustment gains of 9 million 

impact of inflation and currency fluctuation 

economic and political events in certain countries have exposed us to heightened levels of inflation and foreign currency exchange risks the effects of these could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” for details regarding the impact of inflation and currency fluctuation also for a discussion of our risk factors please refer to part i item 1a “risk factors” 

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2020 would have caused us to pay approximately 30 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 15 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is incorporated herein by reference 

net investment hedge 

the €400 million 450 notes issued in june 2015 are designated as a net investment hedge hedging a portion of our net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the increase in the translated value of the debt was 32 million net of tax as of december 31 2020 and is reflected in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in other income expense net on the consolidated statements of operations 

other derivative instruments 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower or in euros as is the case with the issuance of €400 million of 450 senior notes due 2023 we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the us dollar equivalent amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 541 million and 500 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

customer credit 

effective january 1 2020 the company adopted asu 201613 which requires us to measure all expected credit losses for trade receivables held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model which includes historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for credit losses on trade receivables for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards for further details the impact of our adoption of asu 201613 was not material to 2020 results of operation or financial position as of december 31 2020 

pensions 

many of our us and international defined benefit pension plans are invested in assets which will be used to cover future benefit payments assets may include investments in mutual funds collective investment trusts indexfunds corporate bonds governmentbacked bonds and insurance contracts or annuity buyins the assets include both return seeking assets and liabilityhedging assets as the population of the plan participants age and future cash flows become more certain we undertake asset derisking initiatives including the purchase of buyin contracts particularly in the united kingdom these investments provide a stream of income equal to future benefit payments for predefined groups of participants however the company maintains the primary liability for the projected benefit obligation related to these groups as of december 31 2020 and 2019 buyin contracts represented 131 million or 16 and 120 million or 16 of the companys total plan assets respectively additionally our plan assets may from time to time be invested in assets designed to diversify the investment portfolio and protect against equity market movements some of these assets may only be redeemed on a quarterly basis as of december 31 2020 and 2019 equity diversifying assets represented 86 million or 10 and 55 million or 7 of the companys total plan assets respectively other than the buyin contracts and equity diversifiers noted above we believe that our plan assets are highly liquid and may be readily redeemed to cover necessary plan payments there is a high degree of predictability of payments made from our defined benefit plans 

based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2020 we expect net periodic benefit income to be approximately 1 million in 2021 see note 17 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

global operations 

we operate through our subsidiaries and have a presence in the us and the 47 other countriesregions listed below enabling us to distribute our products to our customers in 124 countriesregions 



we face risks inherent in these international operations such as currency fluctuations inflation and political instability information on currency exchange risk appears in part ii item 7a of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference other risks attendant to our international operations are set forth in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference information on the impact of currency exchange on our consolidated financial statements appears in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” financial information showing net sales for the year ended december 31 2019 and total longlived assets by geographic region as of december 31 2019 appears in note 6 “segments” which information is incorporated herein by reference we maintain programs to comply with the various laws rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countriesregions in which we operate see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “environmental matters” 

raw materials and purchasing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components contract manufactured goods equipment and other direct materials such as inks films and paper our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins as well as paper and wood pulp products raw materials represent approximately onethird of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of 



specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however in some regions we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we purchase some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global purchasing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of purchasing and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent purchasing practices 

competition 

there are other manufacturers of food cares products some that operate across multiple regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products 

product care competes against similar products made by other manufacturers and with alternative packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are paper packaging expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags and corrugated boxes as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts wood blocking and bracing systems and an assortment of automated packaging and fulfillment systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and consumer applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products 

some of our competitors in both food care and product care have been consolidating in recent years or have been involved in significant merger and acquisition activity and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

seasonality 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality though may be difficult to predict if significant onetime transactions events or nonrecurring charges were to impact our business cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 



research and development activities 

we are advancing science and technology and creating new intellectual property which underpins the development of new solutions for our customers including new sustainable packaging materials equipment automation and integration applications knowledge and support for our digital solutions we maintain key external partnerships and are constantly searching for new partnerships that bring unique value including licensing or acquiring new technologies developed by others our technical capabilities encompass a broad range of disciplines including food science materials science chemistry and chemical engineering mechanical engineering electrical and software engineering microbiology package design and engineering and equipment engineering 

in order to best position ourselves for delivering innovative solutions that are compatible with our strategic intent we rationalized our portfolio of innovation pipelines and focused our efforts to deliver projects that have faster speed to market and that have better chance of profitable growth therefore our research and development expense was 77 million in 2019  81 million in 2018 and 92 million in 2017  

our research and development activities are focused on enduse applications as a result we operate 

 in addition we are expanding our rd capabilities through acquisitions made in 2019 which included rd teams and facilities 

patents and trademarks 

we own or are the licensee of approximately 2850 us and foreign patents and patent applications and approximately 2600 us and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage we file annually an average of approximately 270 us and foreign patent applications and approximately 40 us and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countriesregions jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we have an environmental management system that aids in our management of environmental health and safety matters pertaining to our operations key elements of this environmental management system are implemented throughout our operations we believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees we have a policy in place that guides the company in environmental health and safety matters including training materials conservation communications targets and transparency 



employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 16500 employees worldwide approximately 7000 of these employees were in the us with approximately 100 of these employees covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 9500 employees who were outside the us approximately 4700 were covered by collective bargaining agreements of our 4800 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements approximately 35 primarily outside the us will expire within the next year and we will be engaged in negotiations to attain new agreements many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers restaurants industrial manufacturers retail establishments business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

we may face risks related to health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases the outbreak of such a communicable disease could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries for example the recent outbreak in china of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 which has been declared by the world health organization to be a “public health emergency of international concern” has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity a public health epidemic including covid19 poses the risk that we or our employees contractors suppliers customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities while it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that covid19 could have on our business the continued spread of covid19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt the supply chain and the manufacture or shipment of our products and adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in 48 countriesregions and our products are distributed to 124 countries around the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the us and approximately onehalf of our net sales are generated outside of the us these operations particularly in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 





 these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations between foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 48 of our net sales in 2019 were generated outside the us we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as a result the company is exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results back to us dollars during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors the company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results as exchange rates vary the companys results of operations and profitability may be harmed while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 15 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations the gains or losses associated with hedging activities may negatively impact the companys results of operations 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the currency devaluations in argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

raw material pricing including how our selling prices reflect the cost of raw materials availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemicalbased raw materials and energy could increase our costs while historically we have been able to successfully manage the impact of higher raw material costs by increasing our selling prices if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing 



pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected a portion of our sales prices are determined using formula based pricing which reflects changes in underlying raw material indices formula based pricing lags raw material cost movement by approximately six months we may experience a benefit when resin prices decrease or detriment when resin prices increase to our cost of goods sold before those price changes are reflected in our selling prices as such trends in raw material pricing may have a negative impact on future profit margins we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers and harm relations with our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

unfavorable customer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings 

from time to time and especially in periods of rising raw material costs we increase the prices of our products significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by the customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact earnings 

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or if we are not able to innovate and bring new products to market 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in food processing and service industries the industrial manufacturing and electronics sections and ecommerce consumer preferences for food and durable goods packaging can influence our sales consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods and the global ecommerce and industrial market change over time changes in consumer behavior including changes driven by cost availability durability sustainability innovation or various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

innovation is key to our strategy our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations and we are not able to meet our innovation rate goals our customers preferences continue to trend towards sustainable packaging solutions we believe that we are well positioned to offer these solutions to our customers but our success is dependent on continued innovation in sustainability and our ability to bring new products to market in an efficient manner 

o ur competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new and sustainable products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry and regulatory standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

customers in the ecommerce and food service industry and peers in the packaging industry have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products additionally we may not successfully implement our pricing actions these factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 



largescale animal health issues as well as other health issues affecting the food industry and disruptive forces of nature such as significant regional droughts prolonged severe weather conditions floods and natural disasters may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various forces of nature affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply recently african swine fever a viral disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs has spread throughout china south korea and vietnam as well as within parts of the european union and has disrupted pork production other disruptive forces of nature such as droughts floods and other severe weather can lead to agricultural market impacts resulting in reduced herd size or modifications to the traditional herd cycles which could affect demand for our products severe wildfires in australia in late 2019 and early 2020 may have a negative impact on cattle and beef production in the region also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are involved in ongoing investigations by the us attorneys office usao and us securities and exchange commission the results of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations and our ability to comply with certain obligations imposed by federal securities laws and other applicable rules 

the company has received from the staff of the sec subpoenas for documents and requests for information in connection with the secs previously disclosed investigation those subpoenas and requests seek documents and information regarding the companys accounting for income taxes its financial reporting and disclosures the process by which the company selected its former independent audit firm which audited the fiscal years of 2015 through 2018 the independence of that audit firm and other matters the company has also received a grand jury subpoena from the usao seeking documents relating to the termination of our former cfo and relating to the process by which the company selected its previous independent audit firm the company is fully cooperating with the sec and the usao however we cannot predict the outcome or duration of either of those investigations and there can be no guarantee as to the amount of internal and external resources we may need to devote to responding to any further requests we may receive from the sec andor the usao in addition if the sec andor the usao were to charge the company with violations we could potentially be subject to fines penalties or other adverse consequences and our business and financial condition could be adversely impacted finally any determination that the company’s previous audit firm was not independent during the years it audited could require that certain of our historical financial statements be reaudited by a different registered public accounting firm which could affect our ability to comply with certain reporting obligations imposed by federal securities laws 

we are the subject of various legal proceedings and may be subject to future claims and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings including the securities class action lawsuit stockholder derivative action and other actions described in part i item 3 legal proceedings litigation in general and securities derivative actions and class action litigation in particular can be expensive and disruptive some of these proceedings may involve parties seeking large andor indeterminate amounts including punitive or exemplary damages and may remain unresolved for several years litigation and other adverse legal proceedings could materially adversely affect our businesses operating results andor cash flows because of reputational harm to us caused by such proceedings the cost of defending such proceedings the cost of settlement or judgments against us or the changes in our operations that could result from such proceedings 

concerns about the impact that plastic materials have on the environment along with changes in legal regulatory customer preferences or market measures to address these concerns may negatively affect our business and operations 

public attention to plastic waste and its associated environmental impact continues to increase some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products customer preferences and buying behaviors may change as a result of public attention to plastic waste and current and future regulations such as those recently announced in the eu parliament and in china currently singleuse plastic ban proposals have focused on specific items such as grocery bags cutlery beverage straws and stir sticks expanded polystyrene or oxodegradable plastic at present none of the products we manufacture have been banned 



we maintain programs designed to comply with laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution we also continue to innovate our packaging solutions to meet recyclability or reusability requirements address cube optimization to eliminate nonrecyclable plastic waste and increase the use of recycled andor renewable materials however while we believe that we are well positioned to meet sustainability and recyclability demands of our customers with innovative solutions and new formulations of our materials ongoing development of government policies to restrict waste imports to ban single use plastics and to increase recycling and recovery and changes in customer preferences may have an adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

our operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws that expose us to regulatory scrutiny potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water and the use handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the fda we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to mitigate these risks our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software 



solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

the regulatory environment surrounding cybersecurity and data privacy is increasingly demanding with new and changing regulations such as the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr we could be required to expend additional resources to comply with any such regulations and failure to comply could subject us to significant penalties or claims 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations furthermore we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses without significant use of resources or diversion of management’s attention 

successful acquisition and integration of target companies may be limited by the availability of suitable acquisition candidates the ability to obtain necessary thirdparty approvals and availability of financial resources acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining valuation integration of acquired operations technologies services and products key personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters ultimately we may be unable to achieve the expected benefits and synergies which could adversely affect our business 

we may be required to make payments or unable to collect payments owed to us under agreements or other claims or litigation associated with previous acquisition or divestiture activity 

we have made various acquisitions and divestitures as part of executing our business strategy from time to time this activity may result in the future settlement of amounts with the counterparty examples of these items include but are not limited to purchase price adjustments transition service agreements clawback agreements or contingent considerations 

the settlement of activity associated with previous acquisitions or divestitures may result in us making cash payments including amounts beyond what has been accrued on our consolidated balance sheets or recognizing a loss on receivables recorded on our consolidated balance sheets this may also result in higher legal fees and a negative impact on future cash flow 

we may not achieve or be able to sustain all of the expected benefits from our restructuring program 

over time we have implemented a number of restructuring programs including various cost savings and reorganization initiatives currently the company is in the midst of a restructuring program as part our reinvent see strategy we have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities we have also made assumptions on the expected cash spend to achieve the anticipated savings these assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors in addition our ability to realize and sustain the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control if we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs do not achieve our expected results or are unable to maintain the savings on a longterm basis our consolidated results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liabilities claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 



changes in us trade policies and regulations as well as the overall uncertainty surrounding international trade relations could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

continued developments and recent changes in us trade policies including tariffs on imports from china generally have had and we expect that they will continue to have an adverse effect on our costs of products sold and margins in our north america region in january 2020 the united states congress ratified the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca which is intended to replace the north american free trade agreement nafta mexico has previously ratified the agreement and canadas parliament is expected to do the same the effective date of the trade agreement is not yet known additionally in january 2020 the united states and china signed an economic and trade agreement which relaxes some of the tariffs that had been imposed on imports between the two countries however the agreement has been referred to as phase 1 and the us administration continues to seek additional reforms despite the recent events which have eased some concerns related to the us trade policies uncertainty remains on future trade deals or continued tariffs placed on imports and exports to and from other countries additional tariffs and changes to the us trade policies would likely adversely impact our business furthermore other countries may change their own trade policies including the imposition of additional tariffs and quotas which could also adversely affect our business outside the us 

in order to mitigate the impact of these traderelated increases on our costs of products sold we may increase prices in certain markets and over the longer term make changes in our supply chain and potentially our us manufacturing strategy implementing price increases may cause our customers to find alternative sources for their products we may be unable to successfully pass on these costs through price increases adjust our supply chain without incurring significant costs or locate alternative suppliers for raw materials or finished goods at acceptable costs or in a timely manner further the uncertainty surrounding us trade policy makes it difficult to make longterm strategic decisions regarding the best way to respond to these pressures and could also increase the volatility of currency exchange rates our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing us and foreign trade policies could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or regions in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including civil unrest acts of terrorism sabotage epidemics force majeure war or other armed conflict and related government actions including sanctionsembargoes the deprivation of contract rights the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials the expropriation or nationalization of our assets and restrictions on travel payments or the movement of funds geopolitical events including but not limited to the us presidential election in 2020 or the uks exit from the european union may have a negative impact on the global industrial macroeconomic environment ​ 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we were to experience a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or experience adverse impacts such as plant shutdowns or travel restrictions due to regional or global human health related illness or if such events were to affect a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and thirdparty information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations 

we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 



if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies if any of our senior management or other key personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on time or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries the indenture governing certain of our senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 



the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities our accounts receivable securitization programs and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs andor utilization of our supply chain financing programs can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable or payable balances the creditworthiness of us or our customers our receivables collection experience andor our trade payable payment history 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2019  we had 700 million of longterm borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 09 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 



the full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors including our earnings in the us and the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies 

we have deferred tax assets including state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income within each respective jurisdiction during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize the assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us andor certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets our effective tax rate would increase if we were required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

the us internal revenue service the “irs” has indicated that it intends to disallow our deduction of the approximately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement as defined below 

in the past we have reduced taxable income by approximately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement and thus have reduced our us federal tax liability by approximately 525 million the irs has proposed to disallow as deductible expense the entirety of the 149 billion settlement payments although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed disallowance and are protesting it with the irs this matter could take several years to resolve and there can be no assurance that it will be resolved in the companys favor an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations including cash flows 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our geographic mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied in 2017 the united states enacted significant tax reform the tax cuts and jobs act or tcja and certain provisions or interpretations of the new law may adversely affect us for example the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries or “transition tax” involved complex calculations and had a material impact on our financial results in 2018 many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business additional changes in tax laws could increase our overall taxes and our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way the tax authorities in any applicable 



jurisdiction including the us may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could materially and adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that are not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or future products the resulting loss of associated competitive advantage could lead to decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countriesregions where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the us and in the foreign countriesregions in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countriesregions may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of acquisitions we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of the related assets 

as a result of acquisitions we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 



we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment may result from among other things i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessment by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

although the settlement agreement as defined below has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace as defined below if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan as defined below and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we were also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 we completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities beginning in 2000 we were served with a number of lawsuits alleging that the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability or both and that as a result we were responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders staying all asbestos actions against the company the “preliminary injunction” but granted the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” permission to pursue fraudulent transfer successor liability and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction in november 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in each case in connection with the cryovac transaction as memorialized by the parties and approved by the bankruptcy court the “settlement agreement” a definitive settlement agreement was entered into as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement and the settlement agreement was subsequently incorporated into the plan of reorganization for grace filed in september 2008 as filed and amended from time to time the plan subsequently the bankruptcy court in january and february 2011 and the united states district court for the district of delaware in january and june 2012 entered orders confirming grace’s plan of reorganization in its entirety 

on february 3 2014 the “effective date” in accordance with the plan grace emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with the plan and the settlement agreement on the effective date cryovac inc made aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and transferred 18 million shares of sealed air common stock to the pi trust among other things the plan incorporated and implemented the settlement agreement and provided for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the us bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the plan also provided injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims for our benefit in addition under the plan and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

tableend we manufacture products in 107 facilities with 15 of those facilities serving both of our business segments the following table shows our manufacturing facilities by geographic region and our business segment reporting structure 



other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the us and in many foreign countriesregions some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some of these are leased standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters is located in an owned property in charlotte north carolina for a list of those countries and regions outside of the us where we have operations see global operations above

nonus gaap information 

we present financial information that conforms to us gaap we also present financial information that does not conform to us gaap as our management believes it is useful to investors in addition nonus gaap measures are used by management to review and analyze our operating performance and along with other data as internal measures for setting annual budgets and forecasts assessing financial performance providing guidance and comparing our financial performance with our peers it does not purport to represent any similarly titled us gaap information and is not an indicator of our performance under us gaap investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these nonus gaap measures further investors are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to arrive at these nonus gaap financial measures described below 

our management assesses our financial results both on a us gaap basis and on a nonus gaap basis as management believes it is useful to investors nonus gaap financial measures also provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the core operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses andor gains which may not occur in each period presented and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and peers more difficult obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts   

our nonus gaap financial measures may also be considered in calculations of our performance measures set by the organization and compensation committee of our board of directors for purposes of determining incentive compensation the nonus gaap financial metrics exclude items that we consider to be certain specified items “special items” such as restructuring charges and restructuring associated costs certain transaction and other charges related to acquisitions and divestitures gains and losses related to acquisitions and divestitures special tax items or tax benefits collectively “tax special items” and certain other items we evaluate unusual or special items on an individual basis our evaluation of whether to exclude an unusual or special item for purposes of determining our nonus gaap financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item including among other things i its nature ii whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations and iii whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis 

our calculation of these nonus gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation as a result the use of these nonus gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to in isolation from or as a substitute for related us gaap measures 

when we present forwardlooking guidance we do not also provide guidance for the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability complexity and low visibility with respect to certain special items including gains and losses on the disposition of businesses the ultimate outcome of certain legal or tax proceedings foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the volatile currency market in argentina and other unusual gains and losses these items are uncertain depend on various factors and could be material to our results computed in accordance with us gaap 

adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 

adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude the impact of special items management uses adjusted ebitda as one of many measures to assess the performance of the business additionally adjusted ebitda is the performance metric used by the companys chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments adjusted ebitda is also a metric used to determine performance in the companys annual incentive plan we do not believe there are estimates underlying the calculation of adjusted ebitda other than those inherent in our us gaap results of operations which would render the use and presentation of adjusted ebitda misleading while the nature and amount of individual special items vary from period to period we believe our calculation of adjusted ebitda is applied consistently to all periods and in conjunction with other us gaap and nonus gaap measures provides a useful and consistent comparison of our companys performance to other periods in our evaluation of adjusted ebitda management assumes that gainlosses related to special items may not be reflective of our core operating results 



the following table shows a reconciliation of us gaap net earnings from continuing operations to nonus gaap total company adjusted ebitda from continuing operations 





  

 the company may also assess performance using adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by net trade sales we believe that adjusted ebitda margin is one useful measure to assess the profitability of sales made to third parties and the efficiency of our core operations 

adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share 

adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share “adjusted eps” are also used by the company to measure total company performance adjusted net earnings is defined as us gaap net earnings from continuing operations excluding the impact of special items and the expense or benefit from any special taxes or tax special items adjusted eps is defined as our adjusted net earnings divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding we believe that adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps are useful measurements of company performance along with other us gaap and nonus gaap measures because they incorporate noncash items of depreciation and amortization including stockbased compensation which impact the overall performance and net earnings of our business additionally adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps reflect the impact of our adjusted tax rate and interest expense on a net and per share basis while the nature and amount of individual special items vary from period to period we believe our calculation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps is applied consistently to all periods and in conjunction with other us gaap and nonus gaap measures provide a useful and consistent comparison of our companys performance to other periods in our evaluation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps management assumes that gainlosses related to special items and tax special items may not be reflective of our core operating results 

the following table shows a reconciliation of us gaap net earnings and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to nonus gaap adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps from continuing operations 







  

 adjusted tax rate 

we also present our adjusted income tax rate “adjusted tax rate” the adjusted tax rate is a measure of our us gaap effective tax rate adjusted to exclude the tax impact from the special items that are excluded from our adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps metrics as well as expense or benefit from any special taxes or tax special items the adjusted tax rate is an indicator of the taxes on our core business the tax circumstances and effective tax rate in the specific countries where the excluded or special items occur will determine the impact positive or negative to the adjusted tax rate while the nature and amount of tax special items vary from period to period we believe our calculation of the adjusted tax rate is applied consistently to all periods and in conjunction with evaluation of our us gaap effective income tax rate provide a useful and consistent comparison of the impact that tax expense has on our companys performance in our evaluation of our adjusted tax rate management assumes that tax special items may not be reflective of our tax on our core operations 

the following table shows our calculation of the nonus gaap adjusted income tax rate 





  





 net sales by geographic region and net sales by segment 

in our “net sales by geographic region” “net sales by segment” and in some of the discussions and tables that follow we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information which we define as “constant dollar” and we exclude acquisitions in the first year after closing divestiture activity and the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information which we define as organic changes in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation are nonus gaap financial measures as a worldwide business it is important that we take into account the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies nonetheless we cannot control changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently when our management looks at our financial results to measure the core performance of our business we may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation by translating our current period results at prior period foreign currency exchange rates we also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations as a result our management believes that these presentations are useful internally and may be useful to investors 

refer to these specific tables presented later in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

business and reportable segments 

sealed air is in business to protect to solve critical packaging challenges and to leave our world better than we found it our portfolio of leading packaging solutions includes cryovac ® brand food packaging sealed air ® brand protective packaging and bubble wrap ® brand packaging which collectively enable a safer more efficient food supply chain and protect valuable goods shipped around the world we serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing food service retail and commercial and consumer applications in the markets we serve we leverage our iconic brands leading market positions differentiated technologies global scalemarket access and wellestablished customer relationships 

the company’s segment reporting structure consists of two reportable segments food care and product care and a corporate category the company’s food care and product care segments are considered reportable segments under fasb asc topic 280 our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products and customers corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to or monitored by the reportable segments management see note 6 “segments” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

executive summary of 2019 

sealed air continues to execute on its reinvent see strategy that is transforming how the company innovates operates and solves our customers most critical challenges through our focus on the 4ps sm of reinvent see performance people products process and sustainability we are leveraging our recognized cyrov ac ® and bubblewrap ® brands to fuel future growth opportunities in core and adjacent markets we believe our efforts to increase recyclability reusability and recycled or renewable content creates a competitive advantage the 4p’s sm of reinvent see are driving structural changes throughout the organization with a focus on productivity improvements 

during the year reinvent see structural changes include 168 million in benefits of which 67 million was reflected in restructuring savings to delayer and simplify the organization 64 million benefited operating costs and 37 million favorably impacted pricecost spread operating costs benefits were largely driven by material substitution and alternate raw material qualifications savings on indirect spend sga efficiencies logistics process improvements yield improvements and gauge optimization additionally we are seeing benefits from manufacturing network optimization reflected in these operating costs pricecost spread benefits reflect procurement savings and value capture initiatives on price 

for the year ended december 31 2019 we incurred approximately 102 million or 76 million net of tax in restructuring and restructuring associated charges primarily related to our reinvent see initiatives cash payments including restructuring payments related to reinvent see and legacy programs were 91 million given the success to date and the reinvent see initiatives being implemented we now anticipate that over the 3year period of the program 20192021 we will realize approximately 330 million in benefits which is an increase of 80 million compared to previous estimates the full year benefits on adjusted ebitda from reinvent see were partially offset by negative foreign currency and higher expense associated with labor inflation incentive compensation and investments in the business see note 12 “restructuring 



activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding each of the company’s restructuring programs 

the rd and capital investments we are making in the business are aligned with our sustainability goals through our 2025 sustainability pledge we expect to deliver approximately 50 of our product offerings containing recyclable or reusable solutions by 2023 and are targeting 100 by 2025 by applying materials science we are designing and advancing packaging materials to be recyclable or reusable and contain more recycled or renewable content we are involved in collaborations with partners worldwide to increase circularity for example in food care the majority of our case ready portfolio already meets recyclability requirements we continue to innovate our materials to lighten the weight andor increase recyclable or renewable content while at the same time maintaining the highperformance standards our cryovac ® brand food packaging represents around the world in product care our fully recyclable cushioned mailer portfolio and our paperbased products are gaining traction in emea in 2019 we launched new recyclable bubblewrap ® brand cushioning in north america with 90 recycled content both our bubblewrap ® brand cushioning and our stealthwrap ® shrink film were certified for storedrop off recycling in 2019 stealthwrap ® automated packaging system replaces larger heavier secondary boxes and provides improved efficiency by reducing dimensional weigh during distribution 

in 2019 we completed the acquisition of automated packaging systems “automated” and the integration is underway known for its autobag ® brand automated provides unique and innovative solutions complete with automated equipment advanced materials engineering and field service automated is complementary to our protective packaging solutions for ecommerce and fulfillment operations and offers us adjacent opportunities in the food packaging sector including efoods produce snack foods and portioncontrolled meals since the acquisition was closed on august 1 2019 automated generated 117 million in net sales and contributed 13 million in adjusted ebitda through december 31 2019 we have already identified crossselling opportunities and have begun to realize operating cost efficiencies the company has recognized integration related expenses of approximately 9 million in 2019 transaction related expenses were approximately 3 million for the year ended december 31 2019 net consideration transferred for the purchase of automated was 446 million see note 5 “discontinued operations divestitures and acquisitions” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding each of the company’s acquisitions 

in 2019 the companys overall net sales increased 58 million or 1  primarily driven by contributions from our acquisition of automated in 2019 and the incremental benefit from our acquisition of afp in 2018 foreign currency had a negative impact on net sales of 137 million or 3  excluding currency headwinds food care net sales increased 80 million or 3 due to favorable volume and pricing trends and contribution from two acquisitions in product care net sales increased 86 million or 5  including 178 million from the automated and afp acquisitions noted above contributions from acquisitions were offset by weakness in our protective packaging markets particularly where we have exposure to the industrial and manufacturing slowdown and ongoing trade disputes resulting in volume decline of 72 million or 4  see note 3 “revenue recognition contracts with customers” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding revenue recognition 

business environment and overview 

we employ sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors food service businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2019  no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales additionally in 2019  no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for more than 10 of net sales in either of our reporting segments 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality though may be difficult to predict if significant onetime transactions events or nonrecurring charges were to impact our business cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the second half of the year reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 



other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics automation service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach for more details see “competition” included in part i item 1 “business” 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders 

recent events and trends 

the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 is having an impact on overall economic conditions currently the greatest impact is in china and asia pacific which has the highest concentration of transmission we have eight manufacturing facilities in china with approximately 1100 employees china accounted for approximately 3 of sales in 2019 covid19 may impact other geographic areas in which we have operations our top priority is to protect our people and their families our customers and our operations from any adverse impacts we are taking all precautionary measures as directed by health authorities and the local government covid19 has and may continue to have an impact on ports and trade into and out of china and hong kong as well as travel in the region and globally sealed air has set up a special management committee covering all businesses and sites in the region the committee is taking the necessary precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and following the guidance provided by local health authorities g iven the interconnectivity of the global supply chain and global economy or the rate of future global transmission the impact of covid19 may extend beyond the asia pacific region

reinvent see strategy and restructuring activities 

see note 12 “restructuring activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the company’s restructuring programs discussed below 



in december 2018 the sealed air board of directors approved a threeyear restructuring program related to reinvent see 

sealed air has combined the program associated with reinvent see with its previously existing restructuring program as combined “program” which was largely related to the elimination of stranded costs following the sale of diversey for the year ended december 31 2019  the program generated incremental cost savings of 64 million related to reductions in operating costs 67 million related to restructuring actions and 37 million related to actions impacting price cost spread we now expect the program to generate incremental cost savings of approximately 330 million by the end of 2021 we expect remaining program spend between 80 and 110 million primarily incurred in 2020 

for the year ended december 31 2019  we recorded restructuring expense of 42 million  restructuring activities are diversified across all four regions in 2019 restructuring had the largest impact on our second quarter results during which we recognized approximately 70 of the restructuring expense recorded during the year during the fourth quarter we recorded a net restructuring reversal of 2 million the reversal was related to managements fourth quarter decision to no longer cease operations in one of our manufacturing facilities as well as the reversal of a number of headcountreduction accruals incurred earlier in the year 

we also recorded 60 million in restructuring associated costs for the year ended december 31 2019  restructuring associated costs primarily relate to fees paid to thirdparty consultants in support of reinvent see and costs associated with property consolidations and machinery and equipment relocations resulting from reinvent see 

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to the program described above are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later than expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending benefits and cost synergies 

interest expense net 

interest expense net includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt as well as the net impact of capitalized interest interest income the effects of terminated interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs and credit facility fees bond discounts and terminated treasury locks

see note 23 “other expense income net” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the components and discussion of other income net 

income taxes 

the table below shows our effective income tax rate “etr” 



  

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 was 207  the difference between the companys effective income tax rate and the us statutory rate of 21 relates primarily to benefits related to tax optimization initiatives associated with reinvent see and restructuring activities prior year research credits and a reduction in the valuation allowance offset by expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provisions 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 was 672  the tcja had a significant impact on our income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2018  the 2018 effective tax rate includes the benefit of a lower us corporate income tax rate of 21 and also reflects 222 million of expense for tax related to the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of us subsidiaries under tcja transition tax the difference between the company’s effective income tax rate and the us statutory rate of 21 relates primarily to the transition tax associated with 



the tcja the “gilti” provision enacted as part of the tcja state income taxes and foreign earnings subject to higher tax rates offset by tax benefit for reduction in valuation allowance related to tax initiatives 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 was 840  the annual effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily as a result of expense related to the sale of diversey the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the tcja and an increase in unrecognized foreign tax benefits 

our effective income tax rate depends upon the realization of our net deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets related to accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards tax credits employee benefit items intangibles and other items 

the internal revenue service the “irs” is currently auditing the 20112014 consolidated us federal income tax returns of the company included in the audit of the 2014 return is the examination by the irs with respect to the cryovac settlement agreement deduction and the proposed adjustment to disallow the entire amount paid under the settlement agreement the outcome of the examination may require us to record additional tax expense and result in significant cash outflows 

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences the future income from existing temporary differences and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reverse those valuation allowances we reported a net decrease in our valuation allowance for the year ended december 31 2019  primarily related to foreign net operating losses see note 19 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

corporate expenses increased by 10 million on an as reported basis and constant dollar basis as compared with the same period in 2017 primarily due to foreign currency losses 

liquidity and capital resources 

principal sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our amended and restated senior secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses investments in working capital capital expenditures interest taxes stock repurchases dividends debt obligations restructuring expenses and other longterm liabilities we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months 

as of december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 262 million of which approximately 244 million or 93 was located outside of the us as of december 31 2019  we had an immaterial amount of cash trapped outside of the us our us cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to us borrowers are sufficient to fund our us operating requirements and capital expenditures current debt obligations and dividends the company does not expect that in the near term cash located outside of the us will be needed to satisfy its obligations dividends and other demands for cash in the us 

material commitments and contingencies 

cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies 

the information set forth in note 20 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2020 and future years 





  



 shortterm borrowings current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt   

shortterm borrowings current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt represent the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period 

operating leases 

the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under noncancelable real and personal property leases as of december 31 2019  

other principal contractual obligations   

other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy in the normal course of business these obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase the amounts included in the table above represent estimates of the minimum amounts we are obligated to pay or reasonably likely to pay under these agreements we may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and as a result use additional cash 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2019  we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of 384 million  given the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with some of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we are not able to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority as such these amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above see note 19 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

off balance sheet arrangements 

we have reviewed our offbalance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

income tax payments 

we expect tax payments to be approximately 100 million in 2020  these amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above as future payments are uncertain and dependent on a number of factors including the amount of future taxable income and the results of ongoing irs examinations 

contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our us and our nonus employees we currently expect our contributions to these plans to be approximately 20 million in 2020  additionally we expect benefits related to our defined 



benefit pension plan paid directly by the company to be 4 million in 2020  these payments are not included in the contractual obligations table above as future contributions are uncertain and rely on a number of factors including performance of underlying assets future cash out flows of the plans actuarial assumptions and funding discussions with boards charged with governance for some of our international plans refer to note 17 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these plans 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents 



see “analysis of historical cash flow” below 

accounts receivable securitization programs and accounts receivable factoring agreements 

at december 31 2019  we had 127 million available to us under the us and european programs of which we had no borrowings under the european or us programs at december 31 2018  we had 150 million available to us under the us and european programs of which we had 84 million borrowed under the european program 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we renegotiated the us accounts receivable securitization program as a result our maximum purchase limit for receivable interests decreased from 60 million under the old program to 50 million under the new program at the same time we established a new accounts receivable factoring program under which we sell outstanding receivables to the financial institution the sales of these receivables are accounted for i n accordance with asc 860 transfers and servicing asc 860 asc 860 allows for the ownership transfer of accounts receivable to qualify for truesale treatment when the appropriate criteria is met which permits the company to present the balances sold under the program to be excluded from trade receivables net of allowance for doubtful accounts on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2019  the utilization under new factoring program was 10 million the securitization programs and factoring program are renewed annually 

see note 10 “accounts receivable securitization programs” and note 11 accounts receivable factoring agreements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information concerning these programs 

supply chain financing programs 

as part of our ongoing efforts to manage our working capital and improve our cash flow we work with suppliers to optimize our purchasing terms and conditions including extending payment terms we also facilitate a voluntary supply chain financing program to provide some of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us our trade payables to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions these programs are administered by participating financial institutions should the supplier choose to participate in the program it will receive 



payment from the financial institution in advance of agreed payment terms our responsibility is limited to making payments to the respective financial institutions on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier the range of payment terms are consistent regardless of a vendors participation in the program we monitor our days payable outstanding relative to our peers and industry trends in order to assess our conclusion that these programs continue to be trade payable programs and not indicative of borrowing arrangements the liabilities continue to be presented as trade payables in our consolidated balance sheets until they are paid and are reflected as cash flow from operating activities when settled 

these supply chain financing programs were implemented starting in 2016 we believe they had the greatest benefit to cash provided by trade payables within cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in 2016 and 2017 as these programs were being implemented these programs did not significantly improve cash provided by operating activities or free cash flow for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to prior years 

lines of credit 

at december 31 2019 and 2018  we had a 1 billion revolving credit facility and 89 million and 140 million of outstanding borrowings under the facility respectively at december 31 2019 and 2018  we had 10 million and 9 million  respectively available under various lines of credit extended to our subsidiaries see note 14 “debt and credit facilities” of the notes to consolidated financial statement for further details 

libor phase out 

in july 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 an alternative to libor has been contemplated in many of our liborlinked instruments and other financial obligations including our secured credit facility we do not expect the phaseout of libor to have a material disruption or impact on our financing or liquidity 

covenants 

each issue of our outstanding senior notes imposes limitations on our operations and those of specified subsidiaries the third amended and restated credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type including limitations on our indebtedness liens investments restricted payments mergers and acquisitions dispositions of assets transactions with affiliates amendment of documents and sale leasebacks and a covenant specifying a maximum permitted ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the third amended and restated credit agreement we were in compliance with the above financial covenants and limitations at december 31 2019 and 2018  

see “covenants” in note 14 “debt and credit facilities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

debt ratings 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency   



  

these credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade with the exception of the baa3 and bbb senior secured credit facility rating from moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s respectively which are classified as investment grade if our credit ratings are downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

outstanding indebtedness 

at december 31 2019 and 2018  our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table

analysis of historical cash flow 

the following table shows the changes in our consolidated statements of cash flows in the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  



in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us gaap therefore free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures including certain debt servicing requirements or nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure we historically have generated the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year below are the details of free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  





 



operating activities 

2019 vs 2018 

net cash provided by operating activities improved by 83 million in the current year this was primarily the result of stronger net earnings including noncash add backs improved cash provided by working capital and lower cash tax payments in 2019 compared to 2018 

net earnings were 263 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 193 million for the year ended december 31 2018 noncash add backs to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities were 221 million in 2019 compared to 182 million in 2018 the increase was primarily driven by 20 million of higher depreciation and amortization due to amortization of intangibles acquired from automated as well as a noncash loss recorded from the sale of discontinued operations of 31 million 

working capital represented a source of cash of 14 million in 2019 compared to a use of cash of 20 million in 2018 cash generation from working capital in 2019 was driven by improvements in accounts receivables primarily on strengthened collections and cash generated from organic inventory reduction which excludes the change in balance resulting from the opening balance sheet acquired in acquisitions made this year these improvements were slightly offset by a use of cash in accounts payable in 2019 of 37 million which compares to a source of cash of 43 million in 2018 the change in cash provided byused in accounts payable primarily represents timing of payments as well as the benefits received in prior years of improvements to working capital 

cash tax payments in 2019 were 95 million compared to 155 million in 2018 the improvement was partially the result of onetime items benefiting cash taxes paid in the year including the novipax settlement and benefits from the purchase of automated 

the year over year improvements were partially offset by cash payments made for reinvent see including restructuring and restructuring associated payments of 91 million in 2019 compared to 12 million in 2018 the onetime cash outflow in 2019 related to the novipax settlement payment was largely offset by a onetime payment in lieu of certain future royalty payments for patents made in 2018 

2018 vs 2017 

net cash provided by operating activities was 428 million in 2018 compared to 424 million in 2018 net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 included a partial year contribution from diversey prior to its sale in september 2017 

in 2018 we generated 193 million of net earnings and had 182 million of noncash adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities or 375 million 

in 2017 we had 815 million of net earnings and 255 million of noncash adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities or 560 million the net earnings less noncash adjustments of 560 million in 2017 was offset by a 207 million decrease in income tax payables primarily as a result of an increase in cash tax payments related to the sale of diversey 

overall cash generation from diverseys operations in 2017 was largely offset by cash payments related to the sale as well as restructuring and restructuring associated payments related to stranded cost reduction made in 2017 which was a combined outflow of 230 million cash payments related to the sale and restructuring and restructuring associated payments made in 2018 was an outflow of 64 million 

working capital was a use of cash of 20 million in 2018 compared to a source of cash of 17 million in 2017 cash provided by working capital in 2018 was negatively impacted by inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable we experienced a greater benefit from accounts payable improvements in 2017 

investing activities 

2019 vs 2018 

net cash used in investing activities was 666 million in 2019  compared to net cash used in investing activities of 267 million in 2018  the change in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in business acquisitions activity of 384 million primarily due to the acquisition of automated offset by the cash outflow for the purchase of afp in 



2018 and an increase in capital expenditures of 21 million driven by increased investment to drive growth and improve cost productivity 

2018 vs 2017 

net cash used in investing activities was 267 million in 2018  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 1786 million in 2017  the change in net cash used in provided by investing activities was primarily due the 2017 impact of p roceeds from the sale of diversey of 22 billion net of payments of debt of 777 million 

financing activities 

2019 vs 2018 

net cash provided by financing activities was 140 million in 2019  compared to net cash used in financing activities of 478 million in 2018  the change in net cash provided by used in in financing activities was primarily due to borrowing activity in 2019 specifically we received the p roceeds from the issuance of longterm debt of 895 million including the term loan a due 2022 of 475 million to fund the purchase of automated and the issuance of 425 million of 400 of senior notes due 2027 which was partially offset by the 425 million repurchase of the 650 senior notes due 2020 shortterm borrowings was a use of cash in 2019 compared to a source of cash in 2018 representing a net change 352 million year over year this was driven by decrease in borrowings under the european accounts receivable securitization program and our revolving credit facility in 2019 compared to an increase of facility use in 2018 additionally share repurchases were 515 million lower in 2019 compared to 2018 we continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy to determine the best use of cash including decisions around share repurchases investments in growth and operational efficiency acquisitions and maintaining our debtleverage ratio 

2018 vs 2017 

net cash used in financing activities was 478 million in 2018  compared to net cash used in financing activities of 1890 million in 2017  the change in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock which were 720 million less in 2018 compared to 2017 additionally in 2017 we repaid the term loan a due in july 2017 for 250 million plus 98 million for the brazilian tranche of term loan a finally in 2018 the company had higher net proceeds from shortterm borrowings of 318 million driven by an increase in borrowings under the european accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facility compared to 2017 the use of the accounts receivable securitization program and the revolving credit facility was lower in 2017 due to cash on hand resulting from proceeds of our sale of diversey 

changes in working capital   



  

the 62 million  or 93  increase in working capital from 2018 to 2019 results from lower borrowings under the revolving credit facility and european accounts receivable securitization program of 135 million and an increase in inventory of 25 million primarily resulting from our acquisition of automated acquisitions made during the year had a negative impact on our yearend working capital balance 

these were partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities of 85 million reflecting the timing of accrued liabilities including restructuring and higher accruals for incentive compensation and 26 million related to the liability recorded for our shortterm operating leases as a result of our adoption of asu 201602 leases topic 842 

see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards and note 4 leases of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on leases and our adoption of new accounting standards 



changes in stockholders’ equity deficit 

the 152 million  or 44  increase in stockholders’ equity in 2019 compared with 2018 was due to 

 these were partially offset by 

 we repurchased approximately 16 million shares of our common stock during the year ended december 31 2019 for 67 million  see note 21 “stockholders’ deficit” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel thirdparty experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of trade receivables as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have historically adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or for which additional information has been provided on which to review the probability and measurability of outcomes and will continue to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

revenue recognition 

our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using a fivestep model consisting of the following 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation performance obligations are satisfied when the company transfers control of a good or service to a customer which can occur over time or at a point in time the amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services including the expected value of variable consideration the customer’s ability and intent to pay the transaction price is assessed in determining whether a contract exists with the customer if collectability of substantially all of the consideration in a contract is not probable consideration received is not recognized as revenue unless the consideration is nonrefundable and the company no longer has an obligation to transfer additional goods or services to the customer or collectability becomes probable 



in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 “asu 201409” and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance collectively topic 606 the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services 

we have the implemented the guidance using the modified retrospective method in which the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard has been recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings in the year of adoption for the year ending december 31 2017 the company recognized revenue under asc 605 under which the following criteria were used for revenue recognition persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists shipment has occurred selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 

the determination of whether an arrangement meets the definition of a contract under asc 606 depends on whether it creates enforceable rights and obligations while enforceability is a matter of law we believe that enforceable rights and obligations in a contract must be substantive in order for the contract to be in scope of asc 606 the penalty for noncompliance must be significant relative to the minimum obligation fixed or minimum purchase obligations were the most common examples of substantive enforceable rights present in our contracts sealed air determines that the contract term is the period of enforceability outlined by the terms of the contract this means that in many cases the term stated in the contract is different than the period of enforceability 

our efforts to adopt this standard focused on contract analysis at a regional level we concluded our assessment and identified the most significant impact was on the accounting for free on loan equipment in our food care division whereas previously we did not recognize revenue on free on loan equipment under the new standard we allocate revenue to that equipment and account for the lease component under asc 840 which has been superseded by asc 842 asc 60610154 states that a contract can be partially in scope of asc 606 and partially in scope of another standard in this case asc 842 sealed air determined the proper accounting treatment for contracts with lease and nonlease components is to allocate the transaction price of the contract to the separate lease and nonlease components account for the nonlease components of the contract under asc 606 and account for the lease components of the contract under asc 842 during the contract analysis we also evaluated how the transaction price would be allocated across the performance obligations as a result of this review we adjusted our equipment accrual balance within the food care division to reflect the standalone selling price of the equipment within our portfolio 

leasing activity 

sealed air is involved in leasing activity as both a lessee and a lessor sealed air is the lessor primarily for equipment used by our customers to meet their packaging needs sealed air is the lessee of property used for production and for sales and administrative functions including real property buildings manufacturing and office equipment offices and automobiles 

effective january 1 2019 we adopted asu 201602 leases topic 842 “asu 201602” and the subsequently issued amendments to the initial guidance collectively topic 842 this asu requires an entity to recognize a rightofuse asset rou and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months recognition measurement and presentation of expenses now depends on classification as a finance or operating lease the amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements we adopted this asu using a modified retrospective transition method 

we elected the shortterm lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify this means for those leases that qualify we will not recognize rou assets or lease liabilities and this includes not recognizing rou assets or lease liabilities for existing shortterm leases of those assets in transition we also elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and nonlease components for all of our leases which means all consideration that is fixed or insubstance fixed relating to the nonlease components will be captured as part of our lease components for balance sheet purposes 

we believe the most significant effect of adoption was the recognition of new rou assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our office and equipment and real estate operating leases as of december 31 2019 we recognized additional operating lease liabilities of 92 million based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments for existing operating leases and corresponding rou assets of 90 million on our consolidated balance sheets additionally 28 million of assets that were included in property and equipment net as of december 31 2018 are now included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2019  

additionally we now provide significant new disclosures about our leasing activities we have formed a lease accounting center of excellence which has ongoing responsibility to lead our global lease accounting and reporting under topic 842 we have implemented a thirdparty lease accounting software due to the adoption of topic 842 we have also added additional internal controls related to our lease accounting and software solution under topic 842 



see note 4 leases of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional lease disclosures 

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite–lived intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate we recorded no impairment to indefinite lived assets in the current year 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment  the “component” level  discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

in our annual impairment review we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in a qualitative assessment we would consider the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general economic conditions industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation and events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the carrying value of net assets 

if the results of our qualitative assessment indicate it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we are required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 

alternatively if an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed we may perform a quantitative assessment under the quantitative assessment we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value there would be no indication of impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit were less than the carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

under the quantitative assessment we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value fair value computed by these models is arrived at using a number of factors and inputs there are inherent uncertainties however related to fair value models the inputs and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 

we believe the most significant inputs in our quantitative assessment include 





notably automated packaging systems future expected benefits of our reinvent see initiatives and overall market conditions 

 the company performed a quantitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of october 1 2019  we believe it is appropriate to periodically perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment test even if qualitative considerations do not indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value the periodic and timely calculation of the quantitative assessment provides better support for our qualitative assessments additionally we note the changes in the product care reporting unit with the recent acquisitions made in 2017 2018 and 2019 as another contributing factor to our quantitative assessment of goodwill in 2019 

none of our reporting units indicated the fair value was less than its carrying value based on our quantitative assessment we believe the fair value of each of our reporting units sufficiently exceeds each reporting units carrying value as part of our analysis we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate and longterm growth rate assumptions the sensitivities lead us to the same conclusion that no impairment exists 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017  we performed a qualitative assessment no indication of goodwill impairment was identified in 2018 or 2017 

the company also assesses its goodwill for impairment from time to time when warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding individual reporting units subsequent to our annual reporting period we continued to assess whether there were changes in facts or circumstances that would lead us to believe goodwill may be impaired no indication of goodwill impairment has been identified subsequent to our annual testing date 

see note 9 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets net” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2019  2018 and 2017 and other related information 

pension s 

for a number of our current and former us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year we believe the most significant assumptions are the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected future rate of return on plan assets we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life or expected life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 

at december 31 2019  the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plan was 194 million  and the total benefit expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was 1 million  at december 31 2019  the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 704 million  and the total benefit income for the year ended december 31 2019 was 2 million  the employer service cost of our pension plans is charged to cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses all other components of benefits expense are recorded to other expense income net 



material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2019 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2020  





income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carryforwards and tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized on the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 19 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2019  we had no outstanding interest rate swaps collars or options 

the information set forth in note 15 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 16 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 58 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2019  these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

argentina 

economic events in argentina including the default on some of its international debt obligations have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks as of july 1 2018 argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy for the year ended december 31 2019  we recognized 5 million of net foreign currency exchange losses in foreign currency exchange loss due to highly inflationary economies on the consolidated statements of operations related to the designation of argentina as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as of december 31 2019  1 of our consolidated net sales were derived from our products sold in argentina and net assets include 9 million of cash and cash equivalents domiciled in argentina also as of december 31 2019  our argentina subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 24 million  

russia 

the us and the european union eu have imposed sanctions on various sectors of the russian economy and on transactions with certain russian nationals and entities russia has also announced economic sanctions against the us and other nations that include a ban on imports of certain products these sanctions are not expected to have a material impact on our business as much of the operations in russia support local production however they may limit the amount of future business the company does with customers involved in activities in russia as of december 31 2019  we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact to our 2020 results of operations as of december 31 2019  2 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into russia and net assets include 18 million of cash and cash equivalents domiciled in russia also as of december 31 2019  our russia subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 27 million  



brazil 

recent economic events in brazil including changes in the benchmark interest rate set by the brazilian central bank have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks however as of december 31 2019  we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2020 results of operations as of december 31 2019  3 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into brazil and net assets include 24 million of cash and cash equivalents also as of december 31 2019  our brazil subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 38 million  

united kingdom 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom uk exited the european union referred to as brexit the uk has agreed to abide by eu rules during a transition period until the end of the 2020 at which point the european union and the uk expect to have agreements in place regarding future ties including trade customs commerce and travel although the uk and the eu continue to work out terms of the final arrangements and agreements particularly around trade the company has taken steps to mitigate the impact of brexit the exit date was delayed several times as terms of the deal were developed providing the company along with our customers and suppliers additional time to execute action plans to mitigate the impact of brexit 

brexit may impact the way we serve our customers in the uk and in ireland as we expect the uks exit from the european union to reduce efficiencies associated with serving customers in these countries from a central location over the last two years we have deployed a crossfunctional team to develop and implement changes to our operating model and legal entity structure to efficiently address challenges that may arise from brexit including customs processing and clearance transit and logistics time and potential updates to terms and conditions present within our customer contracts we continue to monitor inventory levels including any incremental stock that may be required to minimize disruptions to our business and our customers business 

brexit may also require us to tighten credit controls however for the year ended december 31 2019  bad debt expense recognized in the uk was consistent with the year ended december 31 2018 and was not material to the company in the first quarter of 2020 the company will adopt a su 201613 which requires us to measure all expected credit losses for trade receivable balances held at the reporting date based on an expected loss model which includes historical experience and current conditions future impacts of brexit will be included in our analysis of current and forward looking expectations though we believe the impact of adoption coupled with brexit will not have a material impact on bad debt expense 

given the implementation of brexit we believe that the devaluation of the sterling has stabilized with the value of the currency increasing in the later part of 2019 nevertheless any further devaluation would have a negative impact on our financial results reported in us dollars as of december 31 2019  we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2020 results of operations as of december 31 2019  3 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into the uk which is down from 4 in the prior year we believe that the impact of brexit on the country including an overall weight on economic growth in the uk did have an impact on net sales net assets in the uk include 6 million of cash and cash equivalents and 14 million in inventory also as of december 31 2019  our uk subsidiaries had cumulative translation adjustment losses of 21 million  

a large concentration of the companys defined benefit plans is in the uk approximately 36 of the companys projected benefit obligation and 47 of defined benefit plan assets are in the uk market volatility could have a negative impact on both our plan assets and our benefit obligations however we believe that the market and associated impacts on the value of our plan assets and assumptions used to determine the projected benefit obligation reflect the uncertainties related to brexit our plan assets and obligations presented in our consolidated balance sheets and in note 17 profit sharing retirement savings plan and defined benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements are valued as of december 31 2019  the company and the plans trustees have employed derisking strategies in the defined benefit asset portfolios to reduce market volatility risk interest rate risk and future cash flow risk our defined benefit assets in the uk are diversified between international equities fixed income investments and insurance buyin contracts which all help mitigate market volatility risk 

impact of inflation and currency fluctuation 

economic and political events in certain countries have exposed us to heightened levels of inflation and foreign currency exchange risks the effects of these could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding the impact of inflation and currency fluctuation also for a discussion of our risk factors please refer to part i item 1a “risk factors” 



foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2019 would have caused us to pay approximately 32 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 15 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements is incorporated herein by reference 

net investment hedge 

the €400 million 450 notes issued in june 2015 are designated as a net investment hedge hedging a portion of our net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the decrease in the translated value of the debt was 2 million net of tax as of december 31 2019  and is reflected in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

in march 2015 we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps with a combined notional amount of 425 million hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result of the sale of diversey we terminated these crosscurrency swaps in september 2017 and settled these swaps in october 2017 the fair value of the swaps on the date of termination was a liability of 62 million which was partially offset by semiannual interest settlements of 18 million  this resulted in a net impact of 44 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in other income net on the consolidated statements of operations 

other derivative instruments 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower or in euros as is the case with the issuance of €400 million of 450 senior notes due 2023 we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the us dollar equivalent amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 500 million and 590 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 2 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 and less than 1 million for the year ended december 31 2017  the allowance for doubtful accounts was 8 million and 9 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 



pensions 

many of our us and international defined benefit pension plans are invested in assets which will be used to cover future benefit payments assets may include investments in mutual funds collective investment trusts indexfunds corporate bonds governmentbacked bonds and insurance contracts or annuity or buyins the assets include both return seeking assets and liabilityhedging assets as the population of the plan participants age and future cash flows become more certain we undertake asset derisking initiatives including the purchase of buyin contracts particularly in the united kingdom these investments provide a stream of income equal to future benefit payments for predefined groups of participants however the company maintains the primary liability for the projected benefit obligation related to these groups as of december 31 2019  buyin contracts represented 120 million or 16 of the companys total plan assets additionally our plan assets may from time to time be invested in assets designed to diversify the investment portfolio and protect against equity market movements some of these assets may only be redeemed on a quarterly basis as of december 31 2019  equity diversifying assets represented 55 million or 7 of the companys total plan assets other than the buyin contracts and equity diversifiers noted above we believe that our plan assets are highly liquid and may be readily redeemed to cover necessary plan payments there is a high degree of predictability of payments made from our defined benefit plans 

based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2019  we expect net periodic benefit expense to be less than 1 million in 2020  see note 17 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

global operations 

we operate through our subsidiaries and have a presence in the us and the 47 other countriesregions listed below enabling us to distribute our products to our customers in 123  countriesregions 



we face risks inherent in these international operations such as currency fluctuations inflation and political instability information on currency exchange risk appears in part ii item 7a of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference other risks attendant to our international operations are set forth in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference information on the impact of currency exchange on our consolidated financial statements appears in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” financial information showing net sales and total longlived assets by geographic region for each of the two years ended december 31 2018  appears in note 5 “segments” which information is incorporated herein by reference we maintain programs to comply with the various laws rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countriesregions in which we operate see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “environmental matters” 

raw materials and purchasing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components contract manufactured goods equipment and other direct materials such as inks films and paper our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins as well as paper and wood pulp products raw materials represent approximately onethird of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ®  brand cushioning inks for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of   

supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we purchase some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global purchasing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of purchasing and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent purchasing practices 

competition 

there are other manufacturers of food cares products some operate across multiple regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products 

product care competes against similar products made by other manufacturers and with alternative packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are paper packaging expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags and corrugated boxes as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts wood blocking and bracing systems and an assortment of automated packaging and fulfillment systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and consumer applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products 

seasonality 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

research and development activities 

we are advancing science and technology and creating new intellectual property which underpins the development of new solutions for our customers including new sustainable packaging materials equipment automation and integration applications knowledge and support for our digital solutions we maintain key external partnerships and are constantly searching for new partnerships that bring unique value including licensing or acquiring new technologies developed by others our technical capabilities encompass a broad range of disciplines including food science materials science chemistry and chemical engineering mechanical engineering electrical and software engineering microbiology package design and engineering and equipment engineering our research and development expense was 81 million  in 2018  92 million  in 2017  and 88 million  in 2016  

our research and development activities are focused on enduse applications as a result we operate 



patents and trademarks 

we own or are the licensee of approximately 2700  us and foreign patents and patent applications and approximately 3100  us and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage we file annually an average of approximately 200  us and foreign patent applications and approximately 35  us and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countriesregions jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees 

sustainability 

as a leader in highperformance packaging innovation we are committed to continually improving the environmental sustainability of our products this commitment has already delivered positive environmental impacts for us and our customers cutting resource use  and waste and differentiating us from competitors we are investing in the use of recycled and renewable materials expanding reuse models for our packaging and leading collaboration with partners worldwide on our sustainability efforts 

for more infor mation on our sustainability commitments including our operational efficiency goals and performance please see the sustainability section of our website 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 15500 employees worldwide approximately 6000  of these employees were in the us with approximately 100  of these employees covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 9500  employees who were outside the us approximately 5200  were covered by collective bargaining agreements collective bargaining agreements related to 20 of our employees primarily outside the us will expire within the next year and we will be engaged in negotiations to attain new agreements many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers hotels restaurants retail establishments other retailers business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in 48  countriesregions and our products are distributed to 123  countriesregions around the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the us and a majority of our net sales are generated outside of the us these operations particularly in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 



 these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations between foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 49  of our net sales in 2018  were generated outside the us we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as a result the company is exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results back to us dollars during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors the company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results as exchange rates vary the companys results of operations and profitability may be harmed while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 13 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations the gains or losses associated with hedging activities may harm the companys results of operations 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in argentina and venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical based raw materials and energy could increase our costs while historically we have been able to successfully manage the impact of higher raw material costs by increasing our selling prices if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

unfavorable customer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings 

from time to time and especially in periods of rising raw material costs we increase the prices of our products significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by the customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact earnings 

we may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring program 

we have implemented a number of restructuring programs including various cost savings and reorganization initiatives most recently the company announced a restructuring program as part of its reinvent see strategy we have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities we have also made assumptions on the expected cash spend to achieve the anticipated savings these assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors in addition our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control if we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results our consolidated results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted 

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in the food processing and food service industries consumer preferences for food and packaging formats of prepackaged food can influence our sales as can consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods changes in consumer behavior including changes in consumer preferences driven by various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

customers in the food service food and beverage processing sectors have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products additionally we may not successfully implement our pricing actions these factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to regulatory scrutiny potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water and the use handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the 

disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our european operations as a result of a european union “eu” directive “registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals” eu directive no 20061907 enacted on december 18 2006 the directive imposes several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical substances manufactured or marketed in europe the eu has also enacted a “classification packaging and labeling” regulation other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements 

ongoing development of government policies to restrict waste imports to ban single use plastics and to increase recycling and recovery such as those recently announced in the eu and china highlight a variety of financial liability and increased operating cost exposures we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry and regulatory standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to mitigate these risks our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or acquired businesses may underperform relative to our expectations furthermore we may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses without significant use of resources or diversion of management’s attention 

successful acquisition and integration of target companies may be limited by the availability of suitable acquisition candidates the ability to obtain necessary thirdparty approvals and availability of financial resources acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulty determining valuation integration of acquired operations technologies services and products key personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business matters ultimately we may be unable to achieve the expected benefits and synergies which could adversely affect our business 

disruptive forces of nature such as significant regional droughts prolonged severe weather conditions floods natural disasters and largescale animal health issues as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various forces of nature affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply other disruptive forces of nature such as droughts floods and other severe weather can lead to agricultural market impacts resulting in reduced herd size or modifications to the traditional herd cycles which could affect demand for our products also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liabilities claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

changes in us trade policies and regulations as well as the overall uncertainty surrounding international trade relations could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

recent changes in us trade policies including tariffs on imports from china generally have had and we expect that they will continue to have an adverse effect on our costs of products sold and margins in our north america segment in november 2018 the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca which is intended to replace the north american free trade agreement nafta was signed but has not yet been ratified there remains uncertainty regarding when the usmca would be adopted as well as the specific impacts of the final agreement further changes in us trade policies may be put into place including additional import tariffs and tariffs on raw materials imported from canada and mexico if the replacement trade agreement reached by the three countries is not ratified additional tariffs and changes to the us trade policies would likely adversely impact our business in response to these changes other countries may change their own trade policies including the imposition of additional tariffs and quotas which could also adversely affect our business outside the us 

in order to mitigate the impact of these traderelated increases on our costs of products sold we may increase prices in certain markets and over the longer term make changes in our supply chain and potentially our us manufacturing strategy implementing price increases may cause our customers to find alternative sources for their products we may be unable to successfully pass on these costs through price increases adjust our supply chain without incurring significant costs or locate alternative suppliers for raw materials or finished goods at acceptable costs or in a timely manner further the uncertainty surrounding us trade policy makes it difficult to make longterm strategic decisions regarding the best way to respond to these pressures and could also increase the volatility of currency exchange rates our inability to effectively manage the negative impacts of changing us and foreign trade policies could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countriesregions or regions in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including civil unrest acts of terrorism sabotage epidemics force majeure war or other armed conflict and related government actions including sanctionsembargoes the deprivation of contract rights the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials the expropriation or nationalization of our assets and restrictions on travel payments or the movement of funds in particular if additional restrictions on trade with russia were adopted by the european union or the us and were applicable to our products we could lose sales and experience lower growth rates in the future ​ 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and thirdparty information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations 

we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies if any of our senior management or other key personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on time or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict 

our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries the indenture governing certain of our senior notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities our accounts receivable securitization programs and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 



 in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2018  we had 224 million  of longterm borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 03 million  increase or decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors including our earnings in the us 

we have deferred tax assets including state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income within each respective jurisdiction during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize the assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us andor certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets our effective tax rate would increase if we were required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

although the settlement agreement as defined in note 18 “commitments and contingencies” has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace as defined below if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan as defined below and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we were also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 we completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities beginning in 2000 we were served with a number of lawsuits alleging that the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability or both and as a result we were responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders staying all asbestos actions against the company the “preliminary injunction” but granted the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” permission to pursue fraudulent transfer successor liability and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in each case in connection with the cryovac transaction a definitive settlement agreement was entered into as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement 

subsequently the bankruptcy court issued a confirmation order confirming graces plan or reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the plan and the district court issued a similar confirmation order on february 3 2014 the “effective date” in accordance with the plan grace emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with the plan and the settlement agreement on the effective date cryovac inc made aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and transferred 18 million shares of sealed air common stock to the pi trust among other things the plan incorporated and implemented the settlement agreement and provided for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the us bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the plan also provided injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims for our benefit in addition under the plan and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities the bankruptcy court entered orders overruling all objections and confirming the plan on january 31 2011 and february 15 2011 collectively the “bankruptcy court confirmation order” on january 30 2012 and june 11 2012 the district court entered orders collectively with the bankruptcy court confirmation orders the “confirmation orders” overruling all objections to the plan and confirming the plan in its entirety including the approval and issuance of the injunctions releases and indemnifications set forth in the plan and the bankruptcy court confirmation order five appeals to the confirmation orders were filed with the united states court of appeals for the third circuit the “third circuit court of appeals” the third circuit court of appeals dismissed or denied the appeals in separate opinions with the final dismissal occurring on february 3 2014 the “effective date” 

following the effective date the bankruptcy court issued an order dismissing the proceedings pursuant to which the preliminary injunction was issued notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

from november 2004 the company and specified subsidiaries were named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of grace’s alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos containing products in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by grace was approved by the canadian court and the plan provides for payment of these claims we have no positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us became operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in grace’s us chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding the plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code the canadian court issued an order on april 8 2011 recognizing and giving full effect to the bankruptcy court’s confirmation order in all provinces and territories of canada these and other canadian actions were dismissed or discontinued with prejudice notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay damages which we cannot estimate at this time for further information concerning these matters see note 18 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the us internal revenue service the “irs” has indicated that it intends to disallow our deduction of the approximately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement as defined in note 18 “commitments and contingencies” 

we are currently under examination by the irs with respect to the deduction of the approximately 149 billion for the 2014 taxable year for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement the irs has indicated that it intends to disallow this deduction in full we strongly disagree with the irs position and are protesting this finding with the irs the resolution of the irss challenge could take several years and the outcome cannot be predicted nevertheless we believe that we have meritorious defenses for the deduction of the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement if the irss disallowance of the deduction were sustained in whole or in part we would have to remit all or a portion of the benefit received associated with the settlement agreement deduction which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our 

consolidated financial condition and results of operations for further information concerning this matter see note 18 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our geographic mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied in 2017 the united states enacted significant tax reform the tax cuts and jobs act or tcja and certain provisions or interpretations of the new law may adversely affect us for example the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries or “transition tax” involved complex calculations and had a material impact on our financial results in 2018 many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business additional changes in tax laws could increase our overall taxes and our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the us may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations 

concerns about greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits it is also possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could materially and adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and 

prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that are not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or future products the resulting loss of associated competitive advantage could lead to decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countriesregions where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the us and in the foreign countriesregions in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countriesregions may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of acquisitions we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of the related assets 

as a result of acquisitions we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment may result from among other things i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessment by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the 

carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

tableend we manufacture products in 100  facilities with 15 of those facilities serving more than one of our business segments the following table shows our manufacturing facilities by geographic region and our business segment reporting structure 



other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the us and in many foreign countriesregions some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some of these are leased standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters is located in an owned property in charlotte north carolina for a list of those countriesregions outside of the us where we have operations see global operations above 

we believe that our manufacturing warehouse office and other facilities are well maintained suitable for their purposes and adequate for our needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

the information set forth in note 18 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2018  we were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “superfund” sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2018  environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

on june 25 2018 the company received from the staff of the sec a subpoena for documents including requests concerning the companys accounting for income taxes its financial reporting and disclosures and other matters we are fully cooperating with the sec on this matter and cannot predict the outcome or the duration of the sec investigation 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the second half of the year reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics automation service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach for more details see “competition” included in part i item 1 “business” 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including 

petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders

foreign currency translation impact on consolidated financial results 

since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated financial results into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our financial results from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact historically the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro the chinese renminbi the australian dollar the brazilian real the british pound the canadian dollar and the mexican peso 

the following table presents the approximate favorable or unfavorable impact foreign currency translation had on some of our consolidated financial results

restructuring activities 

see note 10 “restructuring activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding each of the company’s restructuring programs discussed below restructuring plan’s accrual spending and other activity for the year ended december 31 2018  

in the first quarter of 2016 the board of directors agreed to consolidate the remaining activities of all restructuring programs to create a single program to be called the “sealed air restructuring program” or the “program” 

in december 2018 the sealed air board of directors approved a threeyear restructuring program “new program” to drive total annualized savings by the end of 2021 in the range of 215 to 235 million the total cash cost of the new program is estimated to be in the range of 190 to 220 million which will be incurred primarily in 2019 and 2020 

sealed air will combine the new program with its existing restructuring program “program” which was largely related to the elimination of stranded costs the program is estimated to generate incremental cost savings of 240 million to 260 million by the end of 2021 compared with the savings run rate achieved by the end of 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018  the program generated incremental cost savings of 44 million primarily in selling general and administrative expenses 

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to the program described above are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later than expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending benefits and cost synergies

 other expense income net 

see note 21 “other expense income net” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the components and discussion of other income net 

income taxes 

the table below shows our effective income tax rate “etr” 



  

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018  was 672  the tcja had a significant impact on our income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2018  the 2018 effective tax rate includes the benefit of a lower us corporate income tax rate of 21 and also reflects 222 million of expense for tax related to the onetime mandatory tax on 

previously deferred foreign earnings of us subsidiaries under tcja transition tax the difference between the company’s effective income tax rate and the us statutory rate of 21 relates primarily to transition tax associated with the tcja the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provision enacted as part of the tcja state income taxes and foreign earnings subject to higher tax rates offset by tax benefit for reduction in valuation allowance related to tax initiatives 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017  was 840  the annual effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily as a result of expense related to the sale of diversey the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the tcja and an increase in unrecognized foreign tax benefits 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016  was 246  the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016  is lower than the statutory rate primarily because of the mix of earnings and the change in our repatriation strategy 

our effective income tax rate depends upon the realization of our net deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets related to accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards tax credits employee benefit items and other items 

the internal revenue service the “service” is currently auditing the 20112014 consolidated us federal income tax returns of the company included in the audit of the 2014 return is the examination by the service with respect to the settlement agreement deduction and the related refund associated with the carryback to tax years 20042012 the outcome of the examination may require us to return a portion of the refund 

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences the future income from existing temporary differences and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reverse those valuation allowances we reported a net increase in our valuation allowance for the year ended december 31 2018  primarily related to foreign net operating losses see note 17 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we reported a net expense for unrecognized tax benefits in the year ended december 31 2018 of 95 million primarily related to north america tax positions offset by statute of limitations lapses in other foreign jurisdictions interest and penalties on tax assessments are included in income tax expense

we  are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the 

progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and 

assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel thirdparty experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of trade receivables as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have historically adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or for which additional information has been provided on which to review the probability and measurability of outcomes and will continue to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

revenue recognition 

our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using a fivestep model consisting of the following 1 identify the contract with a customer 2 identify the performance obligations in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognize revenue when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation performance obligations are satisfied when the company transfers control of a good or service to a customer which can occur over time or at a point in time the amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services including the expected value of variable consideration the customer’s ability and intent to pay the transaction price is assessed in determining whether a contract exists with the customer if collectability of substantially all of the consideration in a contract is not probable consideration received is not recognized as revenue unless the consideration is nonrefundable and the company no longer has an obligation to transfer additional goods or services to the customer or collectability becomes probable 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 “asu 201409” and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance collectively topic 606 the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition asu 201409 expands and enhances disclosure requirements which require disclosing sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers this includes both qualitative and quantitative information the amendments in asu 201409 are now effective 

we have the implemented the guidance using the modified retrospective method in which the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard has been recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings for the years ending december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 the company recognized revenue under asc 605 under which the following criteria were used for revenue recognition persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists shipment has occurred selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 

for sealed air the determination of whether an arrangement meets the definition of a contract under asc 606 depends on whether it creates enforceable rights and obligations while enforceability is a matter of law we believe that enforceable rights 

and obligations in a contract must be substantive in order for the contract to be in scope of asc 606 the penalty for noncompliance must be significant relative to the minimum obligation fixed or minimum purchase obligations were the most common examples of substantive enforceable rights present in our contracts we determined that the contract term is the period of enforceability outlined by the terms of the contract this means that in many cases the term stated in the contract is different than the period of enforceability 

our efforts to adopt this standard focused on contract analysis at a regional level we have concluded our assessment and identified the most significant impact was on the accounting for free on loan equipment in our food care division whereas previously we did not recognize revenue on free on loan equipment under the new standard we allocate revenue to that equipment and account for the lease component under asc 840 asc 60610154 states that a contract can be partially in scope of asc 606 and partially in scope of another standard in this case asc 840 sealed air determined the proper accounting treatment for contracts with lease and nonlease components is to allocate the transaction price of the contract to the separate lease and nonlease components account for the nonlease components of the contract under asc 606 and account for the lease components of the contract under asc 840 during the contract analysis we also evaluated how the transaction price would be allocated across the performance obligations it highlighted the need to adjust our equipment accrual balance within the food care division to reflect the stand alone selling price of the equipment within our portfolio 

leasing activity 

sealed air is involved in leasing activity as both a lessee and a lessor sealed air is the lessor primarily for equipment used by our customers to meet their packaging needs sealed air is the lessee of property used for production and for sales and administrative functions including real property buildings manufacturing and office equipment offices and automobiles in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842 “asu 201602” and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance collectively topic 842 this asu requires an entity to recognize a rightofuse asset rou and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months recognition measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease minor modifications have also been made to lessor accounting inline with revenue recognition guidance the amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements the new standard is effective for us on january 1 2019 with early adoption permitted entities are required to adopt asc 842 using a modified retrospective transition method full retrospective transition is prohibited the guidance permits an entity to apply the standard’s transition provisions at either the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements or the beginning of the period of adoption ie on the effective date we will adopt the new standard on its effective date we believe the most significant effects of adoption relate to the recognition of new rou assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our office and equipment and real estate operating leases and providing significant new disclosures about our leasing activities 

similar to asc 606 implementation our efforts to adopt the asc 842 standard have focused on lease collection and analysis at a regional and operational level we first obtained a complete inventory of leases which are subject to asc 842 we have also identified a system based solution which will become our central repository of global leases for which we are the lessee and assist with the required accounting we are in the process of implementing the system based solution our process to adopt asc 842 was led by a multidiscipline project team including expertise in technical accounting information systems operational leases and asset management and thirdparty consultants we believe the various covenants stipulated in our debt agreements will not be negatively affected by the adoption of asc 842 in the long term asc 842 may impact lease vs buy decisions or whether we enter into operating or finance leases 

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite–lived intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate we recorded no impairment to indefinite lived assets in the current year 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment  the “component” level  discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

in our annual impairment review we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in a qualitative assessment we would consider the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general economic conditions industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation and events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the carrying value of net assets 

if the results our qualitative assessment indicate it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we are required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine the fair value of the reporting unit we would then compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value there would be no indication of impairment if the fair value of the reporting unit were less than the carrying value an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference 

we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value 

fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the company performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of october 1 2018  during the fourth quarter of 2018  and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount in the fourth quarter 2017  we performed a qualitative assessment and in the fourth quarter of 2016  we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units with allocated goodwill no indication of goodwill impairment was identified in 2017 or 2016 

see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets net” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2018  2017  and 2016  and other related information 

pension s 

for a number of our current and former us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data 

historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 

at december 31 2018  the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plan was 182 million  and the total benefit expense for the year ended december 31 2018  was 05 million  at december 31 2018  the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 634 million  and the total benefit income for the year ended december 31 2018  was 5 million  the employer service cost of our pension plans is charged to cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses all other components of benefits expense are recorded to other expense income net 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2018  and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2019  





income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carryforwards and tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest 

ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized on the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 17 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates at december 31 2018  we had no outstanding interest rate swaps collars or options 

the information set forth in note 13 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 14 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 77 million  in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2018  these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

venezuela 

economic and political events in venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk foreign exchange control regulations have affected our venezuelan subsidiaries’ ability to obtain inventory and maintain normal production as a result of the ongoing challenging economic situation in venezuela the company ceased operations in the country in 2016 and has an insignificant amount of operations in the country including sales derived from the country and cash this resulted in total costs of 49 million  being incurred which included the following i a voluntary reduction in headcount including severance and termination benefits for employees of less than 1 million ii depreciation and amortization expense related to fixed assets and intangibles of 1 million  iii inventory reserves of less than 1 million and iv income tax expense of 1 million  and v the reclassification of 47 million  of cumulative translation adjustment resulting in a charge to net income as the company’s decision to cease operations is similar to a substantially complete liquidation as of december 31 2018  we do not believe the economic and political events in venezuela will have a material impact on our 2019 results of operations 

argentina 

recent economic events in argentina including the default on some of its international debt obligations have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks as of july 1 2018 argentina was designated as a highlyinflationary economy from the date of this designation through december 31 2018  we recognized 2 million of net foreign currency exchange losses in net foreign exchange transaction loss within other expense income net on the consolidated statements of operations primarily related to the designation of argentina as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as of december 31 2018  1  of our consolidated net sales were derived from our products sold in argentina and net assets include 3 million  of cash and cash equivalents also as of december 31 2018  our argentina subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 24 million  

russia 

the us and the european union eu have imposed sanctions on various sectors of the russian economy and on transactions with certain russian nationals and entities russia has also announced economic sanctions against the us and other nations that include a ban on imports of certain products these sanctions are not expected to have a material impact on our business as much of the operations in russia support local production however they may limit the amount of future business the company does with customers involved in activities in russia as of december 31 2018  we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact to our 2019  result of operations as of december 31 2018  2  of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into russia and net assets include 6 million  of cash and cash equivalents also as of december 31 2018  our russia subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 33 million  

brazil 

recent economic events in brazil including the increase in the benchmark interest rate set by the brazilian central bank have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks however as of december 31 2018  we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2019  results of operations as of december 31 2018  3  of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into brazil and net assets include 10 million  of cash and cash equivalents also as of december 31 2018  our brazil subsidiaries had cumulative translation losses of 40 million  

united kingdom 

the united kingdom is in the process of exiting the european union which is currently scheduled for march 2019 referred to as brexit although the final terms of the withdrawal are not yet known we continue to assess the risk and impact of the united kingdoms exit from the european union on our operations controls and financial performance 

brexit may impact the way we currently serve our customers in the united kingdom and in ireland as we expect the united kingdoms exit from the european union to reduce efficiencies associated with serving customers in these countries from a central location we are monitoring our processes as well as operating and legal entity structure to continue to efficiently address changes that may arise from brexit including customs processing and clearance transit and logistics time and potential updates to terms and conditions present within our customer contracts we continue to monitor inventory levels including any incremental stock that may be required to minimize disruptions to our business and our customers business 

brexit may also require us to tighten credit controls that will have adverse impact on our sales and bad debt expense continued devaluation of the sterling will have a negative impact on our financial results reported in us dollar however as of december 31 2018  we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2019  results of operations as of december 31 2018  4  of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into united kingdom net assets in the united kingdom include 3 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 10 million  in inventory also as of december 31 2018  our united kingdom subsidiaries had cumulative translation adjustment losses of 32 million  

a large concentration of the companys defined benefit plans is in the united kingdom approximately 35 of the companys projected benefit obligation and 45 of defined benefit plan assets are in the united kingdom market volatility could have a negative impact on both our plan assets and our benefit obligations however our plan assets and obligations presented in our consolidated balance sheets and in note 15 profit sharing retirement savings plan and defined benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements are valued as of december 31 2018 we believe that the market and associated impacts on the value of our plan assets and assumptions used to determine the projected benefit obligation reflect the uncertainties related to brexit the company and the plans trustees have employed derisking strategies in the defined benefit asset portfolios to reduce market volatility risk interest rate risk and future cash flow risk our defined benefit assets in the united kingdom are diversified between international equities fixed income investments and insurance buyin contracts which all help mitigate market volatility risk 

we have deployed a cross functional project team working to mitigate the impact and risk associated with brexit we continue to monitor the progress of the final terms of the united kingdoms exit from the european union along with associated impacts to our business 

impact of inflation and currency fluctuation 

economic and political events in certain countries have exposed us to heightened levels of inflation and foreign currency exchange risks the effects of these could impact our financial condition and results of operations see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding the impact of inflation and currency fluctuation also for a discussion of our risk factors please refer to part ii item 1a “risk factors” 

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2018  would have caused us to pay approximately 42 million  to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 13 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference 

net investment hedge 

the €400 million 450 notes issued in june 2015 are designated as a net investment hedge hedging a portion of our net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the change in the fair value of the debt was 8 million   6 million  net of tax as of december 31 2018  and is reflected in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

in march 2015 we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps with a combined notional amount of 425 million hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result of the sale of diversey we terminated these crosscurrency swaps in september 2017 and settled these swaps in october 2017 the fair value of the swaps on the date of termination was a liability of 62 million  which was partially offset by semiannual interest settlements of 18 million  this resulted in a net impact of 44 million  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in other income net on the consolidated statements of operations 

other derivative instruments 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower or in euros as is the case with the issuance of €400 million of 450 senior notes due 2023 we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 590 million  at december 31 2018  and 544 million  at december 31 2017  

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 2 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  and less than 1 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the allowance for doubtful accounts was 9 million  and 7 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2018  we expect net periodic benefit expense to be less than 1 million in 2019  see note 15 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

in maintaining our foreign operations we face risks inherent in these operations such as currency fluctuations inflation and political instability information on currency exchange risk appears in part ii item 7a of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference other risks attendant to our foreign operations are set forth in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference information on the impact of currency exchange on our consolidated financial statements appears in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” financial information showing net sales and total longlived assets by geographic region for each of the two years ended december 31 2017  appears in note 4 “segments” which information is incorporated herein by reference we maintain programs to comply with the various laws rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countriesregions in which we operate see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “environmental matters” 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 15000 employees worldwide approximately 5800 of these employees were in the us with approximately 112 of these employees covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 9200 employees who were outside the us approximately 5400 were covered by collective bargaining agreements collective bargaining agreements related to 15 of our employees primarily outside the us will expire within the next year and we will be engaged in negotiations to attain new agreements many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 

marketing distribution and customers 

at december 31 2017  we employed approximately 2300 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers

our food care applications are largely sold direct while most of our product care products are sold through business supply distributors 

we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2017  no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

seasonality 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price there are also other companies producing competing products that are wellestablished since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership we invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year as compared with our packaging peers 

there are other manufacturers of food care products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products and ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays 

our product care products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts wood blocking and bracing systems and a portfolio of automated packaging and fulfillment systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products additionally due to internal technology development investments and the acquisition of b equipment in 2015 we are a leader in automated void reduction systems technology and automated mailer technology the recent acquisition of fagerdala in 2017 enables us to cater to the top leading computer manufacturers through fabricated foam solutions 

raw materials and purchasing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components contract manufactured goods equipment and other direct materials such as inks films and paper our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins as well as paper and wood pulp products raw materials represent approximately onethird of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap® brand cushioning inks for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we purchase some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global purchasing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of purchasing and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent purchasing practices 

research and development activities 

we are advancing the science and technology and creating new intellectual property which underpins the development of new solutions for our customers including new sustainable packaging materials equipment automation and integration applications knowledge and support for our digital solutions we maintain key external partnerships and are constantly searching for new partnerships that bring unique value including licensing or acquiring new technologies developed by others our technical capabilities encompass a broad range of disciplines including the areas of food science materials science chemistry and chemical engineering mechanical engineering electrical and software engineering microbiology package design and equipment engineering our research and development expense was 92 million  in 2017  88 million  in 2016  and 85 million  in 2015  

our research and development activities are focused on enduse application as a result we operate 

 patents and trademarks 

we are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over approximately 2600 us and foreign patents and patent applications as well as an aggregate of approximately 4200 us and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage we file annually an average of approximately 180 us and foreign patent applications and approximately 100 us and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that 

the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countriesregions jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees

 item 1a risk factors 

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers hotels restaurants retail establishments other retailers business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in 58  countriesregions and our products are distributed to 122  countriesregions around the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the us and a majority of our net sales are generated outside of the us these operations particularly in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 

 in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations between foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 49  of our net sales in 2017  were generated outside the us we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as a result the company is exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results back to us dollars during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars foreign exchange rates can also impact the competitiveness of products produced in certain jurisdictions and exported for sale into other jurisdictions these changes may impact the value received for the sale of our goods versus those of our competitors the company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results as exchange rates vary the companys results of operations and profitability may be harmed while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations the gains or losses associated with hedging activities may harm the companys results of operations 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the section “impact of inflation and currency fluctuation— venezuela” 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical based raw materials and energy could increase our costs while historically we have been able to successfully manage the impact of higher raw material costs by increasing our selling prices if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

unfavorable customer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings 

from time to time and especially in periods of rising raw material costs we increase the prices of our products significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by the customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact earnings 

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in the food processing and food service industries consumer preferences for food and packaging formats of prepackaged food can influence our sales as can consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods changes in consumer behavior including changes in consumer preferences driven by various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

customers in the food service food and beverage processing sectors have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products additionally we may not successfully implement our pricing actions these factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data 

disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to mitigate these risks our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as porcine epidemic diarrhea or “ped” bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as “mad cow” disease footandmouth disease avian influenza or “birdflu” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products in recent years occasional cases of ped and “mad cow” disease have been confirmed and incidents of birdflu have surfaced in various countriesregions outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liabilities claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

we may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring program 

we have implemented a number of restructuring programs in the last few years these programs include various cost savings and reorganization initiatives including the relocation of our corporate headquarters to charlotte north carolina the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount we have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities these assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors in addition our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control if we are unsuccessful in implementing 

these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results our consolidated results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted 

political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countriesregions or regions in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including civil unrest acts of terrorism sabotage epidemics force majeure war or other armed conflict and related government actions including sanctionsembargoes the deprivation of contract rights the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials the expropriation or nationalization of our assets and restrictions on travel payments or the movement of funds in particular if additional restrictions on trade with russia were adopted by the european union or the us and were applicable to our products we could lose sales and experience lower growth rates in the future​ 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and third party information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations 

we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies if any of our senior management or other key personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on time or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to affect 

any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indenture governing certain of our senior notes these notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our 

lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2017  we had 226 million of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 03 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors including our earnings in the us 

we have deferred tax assets including state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income within each respective jurisdiction during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize the assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us andor certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets our effective tax rate would increase if we were required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

a significant deferred tax asset is our foreign tax credit carryforwards the benefit from the amount carried forward may depend upon many factors including the jurisdictional mix of our anticipated future earnings a reduction in our anticipated us earnings or an unfavorable mix of domestic versus foreignsourced us earnings may change our foreign tax credit position which could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods in which any such condition occurs in addition changes in statutory tax rates or other legislation or regulation may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate 

although the settlement agreement as defined in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace as defined below if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan as defined below and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we were also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 sealed air completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common 

ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities since the beginning of 2000 we have been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction we are responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries while they vary these suits all appeared to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders dated may 3 2001 and january 22 2002 staying all asbestos actions against the company the “preliminary injunction” however the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” received the court’s permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction this proceeding was brought in the us district court for the district of delaware the “district court” adv no 0202210 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates in connection with the cryovac transaction the settlement agreement provided for the resolution of the fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction the parties to the agreement in principle signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court signed an order approving the settlement agreement although grace was not a party to the settlement agreement under the terms of the order grace was directed by the bankruptcy court to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions 

on september 19 2008 grace the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the asbestos pi future claimants’ representative and the official committee of equity security holders filed as coproponents a plan of reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the “plan” and several exhibits and associated documents including a disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court the plan provided for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the us bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the plan incorporated the settlement agreement including our payment of amounts contemplated by the settlement agreement and the releases and injunctions contemplated by the settlement agreement 

on february 3 2014 the “effective date” the plan implementing the settlement agreement became effective with grace emerging from bankruptcy in accordance with the plan and the settlement agreement on the effective date cryovac inc made aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and transferred 18 million shares of sealed air common stock to the pi trust in each case reflecting adjustments made in accordance with the settlement agreement under the plan the preliminary injunction remained in place through the effective date and on the effective date the plan and settlement agreement injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims became effective following the effective date the bankruptcy court issued an order dismissing the proceedings pursuant to which the preliminary injunction was issued the plan provides for the channeling of existing and future asbestos claims to the pi trust or the pd trust as applicable in addition under the plan and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

from november 2004 the company and specified subsidiaries were named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of grace’s alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos containing products in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by grace has been approved by the canadian court and the plan provides for payment of these claims we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us became operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in grace’s us chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code as indicated above the bankruptcy court entered the bankruptcy court confirmation order on january 31 2011 and the clarifying order on february 15 2011 and the district court entered the original district court confirmation order on january 30 2012 and the amended district court confirmation order on june 11 2012 the canadian court issued an order on april 8 2011 recognizing and giving full effect to the bankruptcy 

court’s confirmation order in all provinces and territories of canada in accordance with the bankruptcy court confirmation order’s terms as described above the plan became effective on february 3 2014 in accordance with an order of the canadian court on the effective date the actions became permanently stayed until they were amended to remove the grace parties as named defendants two actions were dismissed by the manitoba court as against the grace parties on february 19 2014 the remaining actions were either dismissed or discontinued with prejudice by the canadian courts as against the grace parties in may and june 2015 but for two actions in the province of quebec which were discontinued by order of the quebec court in february 2016 notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay damages which we cannot estimate at this time for further information concerning these matters see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the us internal revenue service the “irs” has indicated that it intends to disallow our deduction of the approximately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement as defined in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” 

we are currently under examination by the irs with respect to the deduction of the approximately 149 billion for the 2014 taxable year for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement the irs has indicated that it intends to disallow this deduction in full we strongly disagree with the irs position and are protesting this finding with the irs the resolution of the irss challenge could take several years and the outcome cannot be predicted nevertheless we believe that we have meritorious defenses for the deduction of the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement if the irss disallowance of the deduction were sustained in whole or in part we would have to remit all or a portion of the refund of taxes previously received which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for further information concerning this matter see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens and a more stringent manner in which they are applied particularly in the us could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole this includes among other things interpretations and clarifications of recently enacted us tax legislation compliance costs and enforcement under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act and costs associated with complying with the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder 

for example under section 1502 of the doddfrank act the sec has adopted additional disclosure requirements related to the source of certain “conflict minerals” for issuers for which such “conflict minerals” are necessary to the functionality or product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by that issuer the metals covered by the rules include tin tantalum tungsten and gold commonly referred to as “3tg” our suppliers may use some or all of these materials in their production processes the secs rules require us to perform due diligence on our suppliers global supply chains can have multiple layers thus the costs of complying with these requirements could be substantial these requirements may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices compliance costs and the unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

as another example the affordable care act the “aca” which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years significantly affects the provision of both healthcare services and benefits in the us the aca may impact our 

cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business we provide benefits to our employees which are competitive within the industries in which we operate the aca did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2017 2016 or 2015 however we are continuing to assess the impact of the aca on our healthcare benefit costs the regulatory environment is still developing and the potential exists for future legislation and regulations to be adopted these developments as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied the us recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business additional changes in tax laws could increase our overall taxes and our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be adversely effected in a material way in addition the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the us may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations 

us federal income tax reform could adversely affect us 

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tcja which was enacted on december 22 2017 significantly affects us tax law by changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations the tcja among other things reduces the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 creates a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of us subsidiaries and creates a new tax on certain foreign earnings we continue to examine the impact the tcja may have on our business the tcja requires complex computations not previously provided in us tax law as such the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain further compliance with the tcja and the accounting for such provisions require the accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced as a result and in conjunction with the complexity of the tax implications associated with the sale of diversey we are in the process of quantifying the mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of our us subsidiaries this amount could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations andor statement of cash flows 

concerns about greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits it is also possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes 

we are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water and the use handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our european operations as a result of a european union “eu” directive “registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals” eu directive no 20061907 enacted on december 18 2006 the directive imposes several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical substances manufactured or marketed in europe the eu has also recently enacted a “classification packaging and labeling” regulation other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that are not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products this loss of a competitive advantage could result in decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countriesregions where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the us and in the foreign countriesregions in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countriesregions may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of acquisitions we may record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of the related assets 

as a result of acquisitions we record a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment may result from among other things i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessment by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the us and in many foreign countriesregions some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some of these are leased standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters is located in an owned property in charlotte north carolina for a list of those countriesregions outside of the us where we have operations see foreign operations above our website wwwsealedaircom contains additional information about our worldwide business 

we believe that our manufacturing warehouse office and other facilities are well maintained suitable for their purposes and adequate for our needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

the information set forth in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2017  we were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “superfund” sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2017  environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

the information in this mda should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in part ii item 8 as well as the discussion included in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k all amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions except per share amounts 

on march 25 2017 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the diversey care division and the food hygiene and cleaning business within the food care division collectively diversey the sale of diversey was completed on september 6 2017 the net assets of diversey met the criteria to be classified as “held for sale” for the period ended december 31 2016 results of operations for diversey are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented see note 3 “discontinued operations divestitures and acquisitions” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

the company’s segment reporting structure now consists of two  reportable segments and a corporate category as follows

see note 4 “segments” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

overview 

we are a global leader in food safety and security and product protection we serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing food service retail healthcare and industrial and commercial and consumer applications our focus is on achieving quality sales growth through leveraging our geographic footprint technological knowhow and leading market positions to bring measurable sustainable value to our customers employees and investors we have widely recognized and inventive brands such as cryovac® packaging technology and our bubble wrap® brand cushioning jiffy® protective mailers and instapak® foaminplace systems 

as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 2300 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors food service businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2017  no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the second half of the year reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership competition is both global and regional in scope and 

includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach for more details see “competition” included in part i item 1 “business” 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders

 foreign currency translation impact on consolidated financial results 

since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated financial results into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our financial results from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact historically the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro the australian dollar the brazilian real the british pound the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the venezuelan bolivar

restructuring activities 

  

see note 9 “restructuring and relocation activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding each of the company’s restructuring programs discussed below restructuring plan’s accrual spending and other activity for the year ended december 31 2017  

as reported in our 2015 form 10k our december 2011 integration and optimization program “iop” is substantially complete while the may 2013 earnings quality improvement program “eqip” is nearing completion in the first quarter of 2016 the board of directors agreed to consolidate the remaining activities of those programs together with the december 2014 fusion program to create a single program to be called the “sealed air restructuring program” or the “program” 

the program is estimated to generate incremental cost savings of 130 million to 150 million which includes approximately 90 million related to sealed airs continuing operations by the end of 2019 compared with the savings run rate achieved by the end of 2015 for the year ended december 31 2017  the program generated cost savings of 32 million primarily in selling general and administration expenses of which approximately 17 million of savings is in discontinued operations 

additionally the program is expected to generate onetime cash benefits of approximately 70 million from the sale of certain assets state and local incentives in connection with the relocation of the company’s headquarters and reductions in working capital through december 31 2017  we had generated 30 million in cash related to the sale of our facility located in racine wisconsin 10 million from other site sales and 9 million from grants and other working capital benefits 

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to the program described above and our relocation activities are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later than expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending benefits and cost synergies 

interest expense 

interest expense includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt as well as the net impact of capitalized interest the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs and credit facility fees bond discounts and terminated treasury locks

sale of equity investment 

in september 2007 we established a joint venture that supported our food care segment in turkey we accounted for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of net income or losses included in other expense net on the consolidated statements of operations in the second quarter of 2012 we recorded otherthantemporary impairment of 26 million 18 million net of taxes or 009 per diluted share this impairment primarily consisted of the recognition of a current liability for the guarantee we issued related to the uncommitted credit facility of 20 million the other component of the impairment was a 4 million writedown of the carrying value of the investment to zero at june 30 2012 we also recorded provisions for bad debt on receivables due from the joint venture to the company of 2 million which was included in marketing administrative and development expenses 

in the second quarter of 2015 sealed air sold its equity interest in the joint venture which had a carrying value of zero and in connection with the closing of this sale sealed air and the other partner had to pay a portion of the outstanding debt that the joint venture owed for which sealed air had recorded a current liability in 2012 at closing sealed air also collected its outstanding receivables and paid certain payables to the joint venture in july 2015 the partner paid the remaining outstanding debt balance and sealed air was relieved of its remaining guarantee obligation therefore the remaining liability for the guarantee was reversed as a result of these transactions we recorded in 2015 pretax income of 9 million which was reflected as a special item and is excluded from our adjusted ebitda results included in this amount was 7 million related to the portion of the debt that the partner paid which is reflected in other income expense net 2 million due to the reversal of allowance for bad debts which is reflected in selling general and administrative expenses and in other income expense net and less than 1 million related to the impact of the revaluation of the nonus dollardenominated contingent liability and the related foreign currency forward contracts which was included in other income net 

foreign currency exchange losses gains related to venezuelan subsidiaries 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy the foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2016 and 2015 for our venezuelan subsidiary were the result of the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements at the balance sheet date we believe these gains and losses are attributable to the unstable foreign currency environment in venezuela see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the section “impact of inflation and currency fluctuation – venezuela” for further details 

ceasing operations in venezuela 

due to the ongoing challenging economic situation in venezuela the company approved a program in the second quarter of 2016 to cease operations in the country foreign exchange control regulations have affected our venezuelan subsidiaries ability to obtain inventory and maintain normal production this resulted in total costs of 49 million  being incurred which included the following i a voluntary reduction in headcount including severance and termination benefits for employees of less than 1 million ii depreciation and amortization expense related to fixed assets and intangibles of 1 million  iii inventory reserves of less than 1 million and iv income tax expense of 1 million  and v the reclassification of 47 million  of cumulative translation adjustment resulting in a charge to net income as the company’s decision to cease operations is similar to a substantially complete liquidation 

other expense income net 

see note 20 “other expense income net” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the components and discussion of other income net 

income taxes 

the table below shows our effective income tax rate “etr” 

  



  

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017  was 840  the annual effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily as a result of expense related to the sale of diversey the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of us tax reform and an increase in unrecognized foreign tax benefits 

our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016  was 246  and for the year ended december 31 2015  was 455  the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2016 is lower than the statutory rate primarily because of the mix of earnings and the change in our repatriation strategy 

our effective income tax rate depends upon the realization of our net deferred tax assets we have deferred tax assets related to accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes foreign tax credits state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and investment tax allowances employee benefit items and other items 

the internal revenue service the “service” is currently auditing the 20112014 us federal income tax returns of the company included in the audit of the 2014 return is the examination by the service with respect to the settlement agreement deduction and the related carryback to tax years 20042012 the outcome of the examination could affect the utilization of certain tax attributes and require us to make a significant payment 

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences the future income from existing temporary differences and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reverse those valuation allowances there was a negligible change in our valuation allowances for the year ended december 31 2017 

interest and penalties on tax assessments are included in income tax expense 

net earnings from continuing operations

net earnings from discontinued operations net of taxes 

as a result of the sale of diversey the results of operations for diversey are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented during the year ended december 31 2017 we recorded a gain on the sale of diversey of 641 million  refer to note 3 “discontinued operations divestitures and acquisitions” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on diversey net earnings from discontinued operations net of taxes for december 31 2017  2016 and 2015 are included in the table below 



the sale of diversey was completed on september 6 2017 as a result the majority of the discontinued operations activity took place in the first eight months of the year for december 31 2017  net earnings from discontinued operations included 28 million  of tax expense 

for december 31 2016  net earnings from discontinued operations were favorably impacted by  16 million  of reduced tax expense which is primarily related to the release of reserves and a reduced tax rate because of the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

for december 31 2015  net earnings from discontinued operations were favorably impacted by  42 million  of reduced tax expenses which is primarily related to the release of reserves and a reduced tax rate because of the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates 

adjusted ebitda by segment 

we allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments although property and equipment net is not allocated to the segment assets nor is depreciation and amortization included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda as of january 1 2017 we modified our calculation of adjusted ebitda to exclude interest income the impact in this modification was 8 million  and 7 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we also allocate and disclose restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment although it is not included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda since restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are categorized as special items the accounting policies of the reportable segments and corporate are the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements 

see note 4 “segments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation of us gaap net earnings from continuing operations to nonus gaap adjusted ebitda and other segment details 

  

  





  

 

the following is a discussion of the factors that contributed to the change in adjusted ebitda by segment in the three years ended december 31 2017  as compared with the prior year 

food care 

2017  compared with 2016 

adjusted ebitda was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 5 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda decreased 2 million or less than 1 in 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 primarily due to the impact of 

 these drivers were partially offset by

adjusted ebitda was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 24 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda decreased 14 million or 2 in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 primarily due to the impact of 

 these drivers were partially offset by

adjusted ebitda was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of less than 1 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda increased 1 million or less than 1 in 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 primarily due to the impact of

adjusted ebitda was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 4 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda increased 12 million or 4 in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 primarily due to the impact of 

 operating expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior year which reflected salary and wage inflation offset by a reduction in incentive based compensation 

  corporate 

2017  compared with 2016 

corporate expenses decreased by 20 million or 16 on an as reported basis and constant dollar basis as compared with the same period in 2016 this was primarily driven by cost containment actions 

2016  compared with 2015   

corporate expenses increased by 12 million or 10 on an as reported basis and constant dollar basis as compared with the same period in 2015 this increase was attributable to higher selling and administrative expenses primarily due to the impact of annual salary increases and inflation

 5 restructuring and other charges by our segment reporting structure were as follows 





  

   

  

liquidity and capital resources 

principal sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our amended credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses investments in working capital capital expenditures interest taxes stock repurchases dividends debt obligations restructuring expenses and other longterm liabilities we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months 

as of december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 594  million of which approximately 323 million or 54 was located outside of the us as of december 31 2017 we did not have any cash trapped outside of the us our us cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to us borrowers were sufficient to fund our us operating requirements and capital expenditures current debt obligations and dividends the company does not expect that in the near term cash located outside of the us will be needed to satisfy its obligations dividends and other demands for cash in the us 

material commitments and contingencies 

settlement agreement and related costs 

we recorded a pretax charge of 850 million in 2002 of which 513 million represented a cash payment that was due upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of w r grace  co “grace” on february 3 2014 upon grace’s emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization the settlement agreement was implemented and our subsidiary cryovac inc made the payments contemplated by the settlement agreement consisting of aggregate cash payments of 930 million including accrued interest and the issuance of 18 million shares 

we deducted payments related to the settlement agreement in our 2014 consolidated us income tax return as a result we had a net operating loss for us tax purposes in 2014 and carried back for 10 years more than 1 billion of the loss 

as a result of the loss carryback we increased our unrecognized tax benefits by 104 million in 2015 while the company believes it is more likely than not it will be successful in defending the deduction of the settlement payment the ultimate outcome of negotiations may affect the utilization of certain tax attributes and require us to make a significant payment

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2018  and future years   





  

 current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt  — represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period 

operating leases — the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under noncancelable real and personal property leases as of december 31 2017  

other principal contractual obligations  — other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy in the normal course of business these obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase the amounts included in the table above represent estimates of the minimum amounts we are obligated to pay or reasonably likely to pay under these agreements we may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and as a result use additional cash 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2017  we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 199 million see note 16 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have reviewed our offbalance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

income tax payments 

excluding payments associated with the us transition tax which the company is in the process of quantifying we expect tax payments to be in the range of 150 to 190 million in 2018  

contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our us and our nonus employees we currently expect our contributions to these plans to be approximately 13 million in 2018 refer to note 14 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these plans 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures

analysis of historical cash flow 

the following table shows the changes in our consolidated statement of cash flows in the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

  



in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us gaap therefore free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures including certain debt servicing requirements or nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure we historically have generated the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year below are the details of free cash flow for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel thirdparty experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of trade receivables as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

fair value measurements of financial instruments 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 

 our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our fair value measurements 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have historically adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or for which additional information has been provided on which to review the probability and measurability of outcomes and will continue to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

revenue recognition 

our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products and we consider revenues to be earned when we have completed the process by which we are entitled to receive consideration the following criteria are used for revenue recognition persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists shipment has occurred selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 “asu 201409” and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance within asu 201504 asu 201608 asu 201610 asu 201612 asu 201705 asu 201710 and asu 201713 collectively topic 606 previous revenue recognition guidance in us gaap comprised broad revenue recognition concepts together with numerous revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions which sometimes resulted in different accounting for economically similar transactions the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition asu 201409 expands and enhances disclosure requirements which require disclosing sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers this includes both qualitative and quantitative information the amendments in asu 201409 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period early application is not permitted in august 2015 the fasb issued asu 201514 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 deferral of the effective date “asu 201514” the amendments in asu 201514 delay the effective date of asu 201409 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2018 and allow early adoption as of the original public entity effective date the amendments in asu 201608 asu 201610 asu 201612 asu 201705 asu 201710 and asu 201713 are effective in conjunction with asu 201514 

the guidance permits two methods of adoption full retrospective in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective where an entity will have to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings we will adopt the modified retrospective method 

for sealed air the determination of whether an arrangement meets the definition of a contract under asc 606 depends on whether it creates enforceable rights and obligations while enforceability is a matter of law we believe that enforceable rights and obligations in a contract must be substantive in order for the contract to be in scope of asc 606 the penalty for noncompliance must be significant relative to the minimum obligation fixed or minimum purchase obligations were the most common examples of substantive enforceable rights present in our contracts we determined that the contract term is the period of enforceability outlined by the terms of the contract this means that in many cases the term stated in the contract is different than the period of enforceability 

our efforts to adopt this standard focused on contract analysis at a regional level we have concluded our assessment and identified the most significant impact will be on the accounting for free on loan equipment in our food care division whereas today we do not recognize revenue on free on loan equipment under the new standard we anticipate allocating revenue to that equipment and account for the lease component under asc 840 asc 60610154 states that a contract can be partially in scope of asc 606 and partially in scope of another standard in this case asc 840 sealed air determined the proper accounting treatment for contracts with lease and nonlease components would be to allocate the transaction price of the contract to the separate lease and nonlease components account for the nonlease components of the contract under asc 606 and account for the lease components of the contract under asc 840 during the contract analysis we also evaluated how the transaction price would be allocated across the performance obligations it highlighted the need to adjust our equipment accrual balance within the food care division to reflect the stand alone selling price of the equipment within our portfolio 

based on the information we have evaluated to date we do not anticipate that the adoption of the amendments will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements with the exception of new and expanded disclosures that said we currently estimate the adjustment will result in a reduction to the opening balance of retained earnings in the range of 1 to 5 million 

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite–lived intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate 

asset retirement obligations 

the company records asset retirement obligations at fair value at the time the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made accretion expense is recognized as an operating expense using the creditadjusted riskfree interest rate in effect when the liability was recognized the associated asset retirement obligations are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the longlived asset and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment  the “component” level  discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

as part of the annual impairment test we may conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in a qualitative assessment we would consider the macroeconomic conditions including any deterioration of general conditions industry and market conditions including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates increased competition changes in the productsservices and regulator and political developments cost of doing business overall financial performance including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods other relevant reporting unit specific facts such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation and events affecting the reporting unit including changes in the carrying value of net assets 

if an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the twostep process in step one we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must perform step two of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment we must recognize a noncash impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value 

fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units assumptions for sales net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

income approach used to determine fair values 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis we use a discount rate that reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value longterm growth rates provisions for income taxes future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless debtfree working capital 

annual goodwill impairment test 

the company performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of october 1 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2017 and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount in the fourth quarter 2016 and 2015 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units that have goodwill allocated and no impairment was identified 

market approaches used to determine fair values 

we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value 

the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance the “public company method” these multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate 

using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the company the “quoted price method” the third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publiclytraded and privatelyheld companies in our industries the “mergers and acquisition method” 

the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include current and forward 12month operating performance results as applicable and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied under the public company and the quoted price methods a control premium or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units we also compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions if the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates andor other assumptions 

if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change such as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock a decline in current market multiples a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates an adverse action or assessment by a regulator heightened competition strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

see note 7 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2017  2016  and 2015  and other related information 

pensions 

for a number of our us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 for all material plans november 30 for nonmaterial plans 

at december 31 2017  the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans was 205 million  and the total benefit income for the year ended december 31 2017  was entirely offset by settlement and curtailment costs at december 31 2017  the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 702 million  and the total benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2017  was 1 million  

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases 

in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2017  and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2018  in millions 

  



  



income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carryforwards and foreign tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized on the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 16 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

at december 31 2017  we had no outstanding interest rate swaps and no outstanding interest rate collars or options 

the information set forth in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 72 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2017  these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

venezuela 

economic and political events in venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the section “impact of inflation and currency fluctuation  venezuela” for additional details 

argentina 

recent economic events in argentina including the default on some of its international debt obligations have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks however as of december 31 2017  we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact to our 2018  results of operations for 2017 about 1 of our consolidated net sales and operating income were derived from our businesses in argentina as of december 31 2017  we had net assets of 9 million including less than 1 million of cash and cash equivalents in argentina also as of december 31 2017  our argentina subsidiaries had a negative cumulative translation adjustment balance of 21 million

recent economic events in greece including missing payment to the international monetary fund and the uncertainties relating to the ability of greece to remain in the european monetary union may require us to tighten credit controls that will have adverse impact on our sales and bad debt expense however as of december 31 2017  we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2018  results of operations as of december 31 2017  less than 1 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into greece as of december 31 2017  we had net assets of 7 million including less 5 million of cash and cash equivalents in greece also as of december 31 2017  our greece subsidiaries had a positive cumulative translation adjustment balance of less than 1 million 

brazil

impact of inflation and currency fluctuation 

economic and political events in certain countries have exposed us to heightened levels of inflation and foreign currency exchange risks the effects of these could impact our financial condition and results of operations see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding the impact of inflation and currency fluctuation also for a discussion of our risk factors please refer to part ii item 1a “risk factors” 

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2017  would have caused us to pay approximately 67 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference 

interest rate and currency swap 

  in 2014  in connection with exercising the 100 million  delayed draw under the senior secured credit facility we entered into a series of interest rate and currency swaps in a notional amount of 100 million  on september 30 2016 the first 20 million  swap contract matured and was settled as a result of the settlement the company received 5 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  net cash received for these swaps was 15 million  in july 2017 we prepaid the brazilian tranche of 

our term loan a facility due in july 2019 in the amount of 96 million  in connection with the anticipated diversey transaction in anticipation of this loan prepayment we terminated all the swaps used to convert the related us dollardenominated variable rate obligation into a fixed brazilian realdenominated obligation the related activity has been classified as net earnings from discontinued operations net of tax on the consolidated statement of operations 

net investment hedge 

during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forwards totaling €270 million these foreign currency exchange forwards hedged a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and expired in june 2015 the loss of 4 million 2 million after tax is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci on our consolidated balance sheet 

the €400 million 450 notes issued in june 2015 are designated as a net investment hedge hedging a portion of our net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the change in the fair value of the debt was 28 million 17 million after tax as of december 31 2017  and is reflected in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet 

in march 2015 we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps with a combined notional amount of 425 million hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as a result of the sale of diversey we terminated these crosscurrency swaps in september 2017 and settled these swaps in october 2017 the fair value of the swaps on the date of termination was a liability of 62 million which was partially offset by semiannual interest settlements of 18 million this resulted in a net impact of 44 million recorded in aoci 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in other income net on the consolidated statements of operations 

other derivative instruments 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower or in euros as is the case with the issuance of €400 million of 450 senior notes due 2023 we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 544 million at december 31 2017  and 875 million at december 31 2016 

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was less than 1 million for the years ended december 31 2017  2016 and 2015 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 7 million at december 31 2017  and 8 million at december 31 2016 

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the 

performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2017  we expect our net periodic benefit income to be approximately 9 million in 2018 see note 14 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2016 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

seasonality 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season net sales in our diversey care segment have tended to be higher in the second quarter due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price there are also other companies producing competing products that are wellestablished since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership we invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year as compared with our packaging peers 

there are other manufacturers of food care products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the us 

our food care hygiene solutions and diversey care solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach we compete globally on premium product offerings and application expertise innovative product and dispensing equipment offerings valueadded solution delivery and strong customer service and support we differentiate our offerings from competitors by becoming the preferred partner to our customers and by providing innovative industryleading products to make their facilities safer and healthier for both maintenance staff and building occupants we believe our integrated solutions approach which includes the supply of machines tools chemicals processes and training to customers to drive productivity improvements reduce total cost of ownership reduce risk of food safety events and improve infection control to reduce healthcare acquired infections is a unique competitive strength additionally the quality ease of use and environmental profile of our products are unique and have helped support longstanding profitable relationships with many top customers 

our product care products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts wood blocking and bracing systems and a portfolio of automated packaging and fulfillment systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products additionally due to internal technology development investments and the acquisition of b equipment in 2015 we are a leader in automated void reduction systems technology and automated mailer technology 

competition for most of our medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price 

raw materials and purchasing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components contract manufactured goods equipment and other direct materials such as inks films and paper our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins as well as chemicals such as caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants chelates fragrances paper and wood pulp products raw materials represent approximately onethird of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials baginthebox containers bottles drums pails totes aerosol cans caps triggers valves and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment dilutioncontrol warewashing and laundry equipment floor care machines and items used in the maintenance of a facility such as air care dispensers floor care applicators microfiber mops and cloths buckets carts and other cleaning tools and utensils 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we purchase some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global purchasing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of purchasing and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent purchasing practices 

research and development activities 

we maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and improve our existing products and processes including developing new packaging chemical formulations and equipment and related applications using our intellectual property from time to time we also license or acquire technology developed by others our research and development projects rely on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science chemistry and chemical engineering package design and equipment engineering our research and development expense was 131 million in 2016 129 million in 2015 and 135 million in 2014

our research and development activities are focused on enduse application as a result we operate 







patents and trademarks 

we are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over approximately 3900 us and foreign patents and patent applications as well as an aggregate of approximately 10200 united states and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage we file annually an average of approximately 160 us and foreign patent applications and approximately 120 us and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements in the us we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the us environmental protection agency “epa” we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees

risk factors 

tableend

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers hotels restaurants retail establishments other retailers business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in 60 countries and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the us and a majority of our net sales are generated outside of the us these operations particularly in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 



























in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations between foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 62 of our net sales in 2016 were generated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as a result the company is exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results back to us dollars during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars the company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results as exchange rates vary the companys results of operations and profitability may be harmed while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations the gains or losses associated with hedging activities may harm the companys results of operations

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the section “impact of inflation and currency fluctuation— venezuela” 

political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows

we are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or regions in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including civil unrest acts of terrorism sabotage epidemics force majeure war or other armed conflict and related government actions including sanctionsembargoes the deprivation of contract rights the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials the expropriation or nationalization of our assets and restrictions on travel payments or the movement of funds in particular if additional restrictions on trade with russia were adopted by the european union or the us and were applicable to our products we could lose sales and experience lower growth rates in the future​

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on time or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indenture governing certain of our senior notes these notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 





















in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 









in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2016 we had 1226 billion of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 15 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical based raw materials and energy could increase our costs in addition the prices of many of the other key raw materials used in our businesses such as caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants polymers and resins chelates and fragrances are cyclical based on numerous supply and demand factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

unfavorable consumer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings 

from time to time and especially in periods of rising raw material costs we increase the prices of our products significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by the customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact earnings 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors including our earnings in the us 

we have deferred tax assets including state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards foreign tax credits accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income within each respective jurisdiction during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize the assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us andor certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets our effective tax rate would increase if we were required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets

a significant deferred tax asset is our foreign tax credit carryforwards the benefit from the amount carried forward may depend upon many factors including the jurisdictional mix of our anticipated future earnings a reduction in our anticipated us earnings or an unfavorable mix of domestic versus foreignsourced us earnings may change our foreign tax credit position which could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods in which any such condition occurs in addition changes in statutory tax rates or other legislation or regulation may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate

we may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring program

we have implemented a number of restructuring programs in the last few yearsthese programs include various cost savings and reorganization initiatives including the relocation of our corporate headquarters to charlotte north carolina the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount we have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities these assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors in addition our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control if we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results our consolidated results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as porcine epidemic diarrhea or “ped” bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as “mad cow” disease footandmouth disease avian influenza or “birdflu” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products in recent years occasional cases of ped and “mad cow” disease have been confirmed and incidents of birdflu have surfaced in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system

we are currently engaged in a multiyear process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system “erp” the erp is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes accurately maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team the erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties as a result any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders apply cash receipts place purchase orders with suppliers and make cash disbursements and could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations which may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades to those systems while we implement the new erp system while we have invested significant resources in planning and project management significant implementation issues may arise

as of december 31 2016 implementations have been substantially completed for our operations in north america south america australianew zealand and europe with the exception of turkey and russia more simplified implementations are scheduled to be completed in 2017 for singapore philippines indonesia and malaysia 

although the settlement agreement as defined in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace as defined below if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan as defined below and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we are also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 sealed air completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities since the beginning of 2000 we have been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction we are responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries while they vary these suits all appear to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders dated may 3 2001 and january 22 2002 staying all asbestos actions against the company the “preliminary injunction” however the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” received the court’s permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction this proceeding was brought in the us district court for the district of delaware the “district court” adv no 0202210 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates in connection with the cryovac transaction the settlement agreement provided for the resolution of the fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction the parties to the agreement in principle signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court signed an order approving the settlement agreement although grace is not a party to the settlement agreement under the terms of the order grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions 

on september 19 2008 grace the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the asbestos pi future claimants’ representative and the official committee of equity security holders filed as coproponents a plan of reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the “plan” and several exhibits and associated documents including a disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court the plan provides for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the united states bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the plan incorporates the settlement agreement including our payment of amounts contemplated by the settlement agreement and the releases and injunctions contemplated by the settlement agreement 

on february 3 2014 the “effective date” the plan implementing the settlement agreement became effective with grace emerging from bankruptcy in accordance with the plan and the settlement agreement on the effective date cryovac inc made aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and transferred 18 million shares of sealed air common stock to the pi trust in each case reflecting adjustments made in accordance with the settlement agreement under the plan the preliminary injunction remained in place through the effective date and on the effective date the plan and settlement agreement injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims became effective following the effective date the bankruptcy court issued an order dismissing the proceedings pursuant to which the preliminary injunction was issued the plan further provides for the channeling of existing and future asbestos claims to the pi trust or the pd trust as applicable in addition under the plan and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

from november 2004 the company and specified subsidiaries were named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of grace’s alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos containing products in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by grace has been approved by the canadian court and the plan provides for payment of these claims we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us became operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in grace’s united states chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code as indicated above the bankruptcy court entered the bankruptcy court confirmation order on january 31 2011 and the clarifying order on february 15 2011 and the district court entered the original district court confirmation order on january 30 2012 and the amended district court confirmation order on june 11 2012 the canadian court issued an order on april 8 2011 recognizing and giving full effect to the bankruptcy court’s confirmation order in all provinces and territories of canada in accordance with the bankruptcy court confirmation order’s terms as described above the plan became effective on february 3 2014 in accordance with an order of the canadian court on the effective date the actions became permanently stayed until they were amended to remove the grace parties as named defendants two actions were dismissed by the manitoba court as against the grace parties on february 19 2014 the remaining actions were either dismissed or discontinued with prejudice by the canadian courts as against the grace parties in may and june 2015 but for two actions in the province of quebec which were discontinued by order of the quebec court in february 2016 notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay damages which we cannot estimate at this time for further information concerning these matters see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the us internal revenue service the “irs” has indicated that it intends to disallow our deduction of the approximately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement as defined in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” 

we are currently under examination by the irs with respect to the deduction of the approximately 149 billion for the 2014 taxable year for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement the irs has indicated that it intends to disallow this deduction in full we strongly disagree with the irs position and are protesting this finding with the office of appeals of the irs the resolution of the irss challenge could take several years and the outcome cannot be predicted nevertheless we believe that we have meritorious defenses for the deduction of the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement if the irss disallowance of the deduction were sustained in whole or in part we would have to remit all or a portion of the refund of taxes previously received which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations  for further information concerning this matter see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in the food processing and food service industries consumer preferences for food and packaging formats of prepackaged food can influence our sales as can consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods changes in consumer behavior including changes in consumer preferences driven by various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

customers in the food service food and beverage processing building care lodging industrial distribution and healthcare sectors have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

the market for our hygiene products is highly competitive our hygiene products businesses face significant competition from global national regional and local companies within some or all of our product lines in each sector that we serve barriers to entry and expansion in the institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene industry are low 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products additionally we may not successfully implement our pricing actions these factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

concerns about greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials and freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits it is also possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

strengthening of the us dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 62 of our net sales in 2016 were generated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 

also while we often produce in the same geographic markets as our products are sold expenses are more concentrated in the us than sales so that in a time of strengthening of the us dollar our profit margins could be reduced while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the section “impact of inflation and currency fluctuation— venezuela” 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens and a more stringent manner in which they are applied particularly in the us could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole this includes among other things the possible taxation under us law of certain income from foreign operations compliance costs and enforcement under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act and costs associated with complying with the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder

for example under section 1502 of the doddfrank act the sec has adopted additional disclosure requirements related to the source of certain “conflict minerals” for issuers for which such “conflict minerals” are necessary to the functionality or product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by that issuer the metals covered by the rules include tin tantalum tungsten and gold commonly referred to as “3tg” our suppliers may use some or all of these materials in their production processes the secs rules require us to perform due diligence on our suppliers global supply chains can have multiple layers thus the costs of complying with these requirements could be substantial these requirements may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices compliance costs and the unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

as another example the affordable care act the “aca” which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years significantly affects the provision of both healthcare services and benefits in the us the aca may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business we provide benefits to our employees which are competitive within the industries in which we operate the aca did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2016 2015 or 2014 however we are continuing to assess the impact of the aca on our healthcare benefit costs the regulatory environment is still developing and the potential exists for future legislation and regulations to be adopted these developments as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure we are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies adverse developments in these laws or regulations or any change in position regarding the application administration or interpretation thereof in any applicable jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations in addition the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the us may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations

our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and third party information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations 

we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of previous acquisitions including diversey we recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of these assets 

as a result of certain acquisitions including the acquisition of diversey we recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment may result from among other things i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessment by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liabilities claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

it is uncertain we will be able to fully replace the business we lose once the agreement with sc johnson  son inc “scj” expires later this year

in october 2016 we announced a mutual agreement to end the existing business relating to diversey’s distribution of scj branded products to the professional market effective may 2 2017 with the exception of australia new zealand argentina chile czech republic and poland which ended on january 1 2017 although the loss of this business will have a negative impact on results of operations near term we are actively working to replace our scj sales and to develop new products to replace the scj products it is uncertain when and if we will be able to fully replace this lost business which could also negatively impact our future results of operations 

the relationship with unilever plc “unilever” is important to our diversey care segment and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on this segment 

diversey is a party to various agreements with unilever under which it is granted a license to produce and sell professional size packs of unilever’s consumer brand cleaning products in the institutional and industrial channels of trade which expires at the end of 2017 with the exception of a subset of the uk business which expires at the end of 2022 although the term of this agreement may be extended it is uncertain that the parties will agree to do so in addition diversey also holds licenses to use some trademarks and technology of unilever in the market for institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene products and related services if we default under our agreements with unilever and the agreements are terminated unilever fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with unilever is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our diversey care segment consolidated financial condition or results of operations

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies if any of our senior management or other key personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business 

we are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water and the use handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our european operations as a result of a european union “eu” directive “registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals” eu directive no 20061907 enacted on december 18 2006 the directive imposes several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical substances manufactured or marketed in europe the eu has also recently enacted a “classification packaging and labeling” regulation other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that are not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products this loss of a competitive advantage could result in decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countries where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the us and in the foreign countries in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to mitigate these risks our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

 

risks relating to our proposed spinoff or sale of our diversey care division and the food hygiene and cleaning business within our food care division “new diversey”

 

we previously announced a plan to pursue a taxfree spinoff or sale of new diversey any spinoff or sale would be contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions will require significant time and attention of our management and may have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations even if it is not completed

 

we announced a plan to pursue a taxfree spinoff or sale of new diversey any spinoff or sale will be subject to various conditions and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions completion of a spinoff or sale will be contingent upon several factors including but not limited to authorization and approval of our board of directors receipt of governmental and regulatory approvals of the transactions contemplated by the spinoff or sale execution of intercompany agreements and in the case of a spinoff confirmation of the taxfree status of the spinoff and the effectiveness of a registration statement with the sec for these and other reasons a spinoff or sale of new diversey may not be completed during 2017 if at all

 

even if we do not complete a spinoff or sale of new diversey our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences including but not limited to the following







 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from any spinoff or sale of new diversey

although we believe that separating new diversey from the company will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders a spinoff or sale may not provide such results on the scope or scale we anticipate and we may not realize the assumed benefits of such spinoff or sale in addition we will incur onetime costs in connection with a spinoff or sale that may exceed our estimates and negate some of the benefits we expect to achieve if we do not realize these assumed benefits we could suffer a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

 

if any proposed spinoff of new diversey is completed the trading price of our common stock may be expected to decline

we expect the trading price of our common stock immediately following any proposed spinoff to be significantly lower than immediately preceding the spinoff because the trading price of our common stock will no longer reflect the value of new diversey

 

following any proposed spinoff the combined market value of the shares of common stock held in the company and in new diversey may be less than what the market value of the company’s common stock would have been had no spinoff occurred

the common stock of the company and of any new independent company that operates new diversey that you may hold following any proposed spinoff may collectively trade at a price that is less than the price at which the company’s common stock would have traded had no spinoff occurred the combined market value of your common stock in the company and in the new independent company that operates new diversey will depend on the future performance of the company and that new company as separate independent companies the nature of the stockholder base of each company how the market for the company’s common stock and the common stock of the company operating new diversey may differ and the prices at which each company’s shares subsequently trade

other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the united states and in many foreign countries some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some of these are leased standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters is located in an owned property in charlotte north carolina for a list of those countries outside of the united states where we have operations see foreign operations above our website wwwsealedaircom contains additional information about our worldwide business

we believe that our manufacturing warehouse office and other facilities are well maintained suitable for their purposes and adequate for our needs

the information set forth in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2016 we were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “superfund” sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2016 environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the information in this mda should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in part ii item 8 as well as the discussion included in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k all amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions except per share amounts 

we report our segment information in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 280 “segment reporting” “fasb asc topic 280” the company’s segment reporting structure consists of three reportable segments and an “other” category and is as follows 









as of january 1 2016 our kevothermal business was moved from other to our product care segment accordingly all prior periods have been revised to reflect this change

see note 4 “segments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

overview 

we are a global leader in food safety and security facility hygiene and product protection we serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing food service retail healthcare and industrial and commercial and consumer applications our focus is on achieving quality sales growth through leveraging our geographic footprint technological knowhow and leading market positions to bring measureable sustainable value to our customers employees and investors we have widely recognized and inventive brands such as cryovac ® packaging technology diversey ® and taski ® brand cleaning and hygiene solutions and our bubble wrap ® brand cushioning jiffy ® protective mailers and instapak ® foaminplace systems 

as of december 31 2016 we employed approximately 6900 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2016 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season net sales in our diversey care segment have tended to be higher in the second quarter due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be higher in the second half of the year reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership our food care hygiene solutions and diversey care solutions businesses face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach for more details see “competition” included in part i item 1 “business” 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders 

recent events and trends

agreement with sc johnson  son

diversey care division has reached a mutual agreement with sc johnson  son “scj” to end the existing business relating to sealed air’s distribution of scjbranded products to the professional market under the existing brand license agreement “bla” the companies agreed that the bla will expire on may 2 2017 with the exception of australia new zealand argentina chile czech republic and poland where the bla expired on january 1 2017 both companies are committed to maintaining a continuous supply of scjbranded products to customers under the bla while the expiration of the bla will negatively impact the results of operations for the diversey care segment near term the company is actively engaged in efforts to replace the business lost including developing new partnerships expanding existing relationships and growing the diversey brand into new channels

separation of new diversey

on october 17 2016 sealed air announced a plan to pursue the taxfree spinoff of its diversey care division and the food hygiene and cleaning business within its food care division together “new diversey” the taxfree spinoff would create two independent companies new sealed air the remaining sealed air business and new diversey each with an enhanced strategic focus simplified operating structure distinct investment identity and strong financial profile as the company proceeds with that plan it is also exploring other strategic alternatives including a potential sale of new diversey

outlook 

looking ahead to 2017 we expect growth from increased sales in our core business and new product introductions we expect our business will continue to benefit from strong protein markets in north america and emea and growth in the global ecommerce market these positive trends are expected to be partially offset by limited growth opportunities in the industrial sector due to overall weakness in global industrial gdp continued weakness in the australian beef market the expiration of the scj bla and unfavorable currency

the program is estimated to generate incremental cost savings of 100 million to 110 million per annum by the end of 2019 compared with the savings run rate achieved by the end of 2015 for the year ended december 31 2016 the program generated cost savings of 42 million primarily in selling general and administration expenses

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to the program described above and our relocation activities are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later than expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending benefits and cost synergies

in september 2007 we established a joint venture that supported our food care segment in turkey we accounted for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of net income or losses included in other expense net on the consolidated statements of operations in the second quarter of 2012 we recorded otherthantemporary impairment of 26 million 18 million net of taxes or 009 per diluted share this impairment primarily consisted of the recognition of a current liability for the guarantee we issued related to the uncommitted credit facility of 20 million the other component of the impairment was a 4 million writedown of the carrying value of the investment to zero at june 30 2012 we also recorded provisions for bad debt on receivables due from the joint venture to the company of 2 million which was included in marketing administrative and development expenses

impairment of equity method investments 

in 2014 we recognized an impairment of 6 million in connection with equity method investments these investments were not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

the impairments are considered special items and excluded from our adjusted ebitda results

foreign currency exchange losses gains related to venezuelan subsidiaries 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy the foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2016 2015 and 2014 for our venezuelan subsidiary were the result of the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements at the balance sheet date we believe these gains and losses are attributable to the unstable foreign currency environment in venezuela see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the section “impact of inflation and currency fluctuation – venezuela” for further details

ceasing operations in venezuela

due to the ongoing challenging economic situation in venezuela the company approved a program in the second quarter of 2016 to cease operations in the country foreign exchange control regulations have affected our venezuelan subsidiaries ability to obtain inventory and maintain normal production this resulted in total costs of 530 million being incurred in the second quarter of 2016 which included the following i a voluntary reduction in headcount including severance and termination benefits for employees of approximately 03 million ii depreciation and amortization expense related to fixed assets and intangibles of approximately 48 million iii inventory reserves of 09 million iv income tax expense of 10 million and v the reclassification of approximately 460 million of cumulative translation adjustment into net income as the company’s decision to cease operations is similar to a substantially complete liquidation see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the section “impact of inflation and currency fluctuation – venezuela” for further details

on february 3 2014 we entered into the settlement agreement under the settlement agreement we released and waived certain claims against the grace parties and the grace parties released and waived certain claims against us as a result we recognized a gain of 21 million in 2014 which consisted of the release of 17 million of certain tax liabilities and 4 million of other associated liabilities see note 17 “commitments and contingencies – settlement agreement and related costs” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more details on the settlement agreement

other income net 

see note 20 “other income net” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the components and discussion of other income net 

income taxes 

the table below shows our effective income tax rate “etr” 

 



 

our effective income tax rate was 140 for 2016 the primary adjustments to the statutory rate were the following













tax expense for 2016 includes a 1 million benefit from adjustments that would appropriately be recorded in a prior period but which the company has determined are not material to the prior year or current year financial statements and therefore included the adjustments in the current year 

 

our effective income tax rate was 212 for 2015 the primary adjustments to the statutory rate were the following











tax expense for 2015 includes an 11 million benefit from adjustments that would appropriately be recorded in a prior period but which the company has determined are not material to the prior year or current year financial statements and therefore included the adjustments in the current year these items include income from overall foreign loss recapture benefit from recognition of foreign tax credits deferred tax adjustments and additional domestic taxable income from foreign sources

our effective income tax rate was 34 for 2014 primarily due to a favorable earnings mix in jurisdictions with lower tax rates in addition our effective tax rate benefited from the release of reserves due to favorable settlements judicial verdicts and expiration of statute of limitations 23 million and the release of a valuation allowance from a favorable tax settlement of approximately 13 million 

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carry back any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences the future income from existing temporary differences and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reverse those valuation allowances

liquidity and capital resources 

principal sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our amended credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses investments in working capital capital expenditures interest taxes stock repurchases dividends debt obligations restructuring expenses and other longterm liabilities we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months 

as of december 31 2016 we had cash and cash equivalents of 364 million of which approximately 286 million or 79 was located outside of the us there were certain foreign government regulations restricting transfers on less than 10 million of the cash located outside of the us our us cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to us borrowers were sufficient to fund our us operating requirements and capital expenditures current debt obligations and dividends the company does not expect that in the near term cash located outside of the us will be needed to satisfy its obligations dividends and other demands for cash in its us operations 

material commitments and contingencies 

settlement agreement and related costs 

we recorded a pretax charge of 850 million in 2002 of which 513 million represented a cash payment that was due upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of w r grace  co “grace” on february 3 2014 upon grace’s emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization the settlement agreement was implemented and our subsidiary cryovac inc made the payments contemplated by the settlement agreement consisting of aggregate cash payments of 930 million including accrued interest and the issuance of 18 million shares 

we deducted payments related to the settlement agreement in our 2014 consolidated us income tax return as a result we had a net operating loss for us tax purposes in 2014 and carried back for 10 years more than 1 billion of the loss 

we increased our unrecognized tax benefits by 104 million in 2015 for the recording of a reserve related to the settlement payment while the company believes it is more likely than not it will be successful the ultimate outcome of negotiations may affect the utilization of certain tax attributes and require us to return all or a portion of the refund

at december 31 2016 we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 239 million most of which is included in other liabilities and the remaining balance is included as a reduction to deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2016 we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities see note 16 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

offbalance sheet arrangements

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents 

 



 

cash and cash equivalents excludes 53 million and 57 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively of cash held on deposit as a compensating balance for shortterm borrowings at december 31 2016 and 2015 the amount was recorded in other current assets

lines of credit 

we have a 700 million revolving credit facility for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 we utilized borrowings under this facility and had no outstanding borrowings at year end 

there was 93 million and 98 million outstanding under various lines of credit extended to our subsidiaries at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively see note 11 “debt and credit facilities” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 

covenants

debt ratings 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency 

 



 

these credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade with the exception of the baa3 and bbb senior secured credit facility rating from moody’s investor services and standard  poor’s respectively which are classified as investment grade if our credit ratings are downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

free cash flow 

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us gaap therefore it should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures including certain debt servicing requirements or nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure we typically generate the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year below find details of free cash flow for years ended december 31

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel thirdparty experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of trade receivables as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

fair value measurements of financial instruments 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 







our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our fair value measurements 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have historically adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or for which additional information has been provided on which to review the probability and measurability of outcomes and will continue to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made

revenue recognition 

our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products and we consider revenues to be earned when we have completed the process by which we are entitled to receive consideration the following criteria are used for revenue recognition persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists shipment has occurred selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 

in may 2014 the fasb and the iasb issued largely converged revenue recognition standards as it relates to revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap and will be effective for us as of january 1 2018 the core principle of the new standard is that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services

the guidance permits two methods of adoption full retrospective in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective where an entity will have to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings we currently anticipate adopting the modified retrospective method

our efforts to adopt this standard to date have focused on contract analysis at a regional level we currently estimate the most significant impact will be on the accounting for free on loan equipment in our food care division and global contracts in our diversey care division whereas today we do not recognize revenue on free on loan equipment under the new standard we anticipate allocating revenue to that equipment and treating it as a performance obligation we are in the process of assessing the timing of when revenue assigned to free on loan equipment would be recognized we have not completed our analysis at a segment level and are in the process of quantifying the potential impact of the new standard

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite–lived intangible assets such as trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate 

asset retirement obligations

the company records asset retirement obligations at fair value at the time the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made accretion expense is recognized as an operating expense using the creditadjusted riskfree interest rate in effect when the liability was recognized the associated asset retirement obligations are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the longlived asset and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment — the “component” level — discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2016 2015 and 2014 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units that have goodwill allocated 

the goodwill impairment test involves a twostep process in step one we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must perform step two of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment we must recognize a noncash impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value 

fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units assumptions for sales net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

income approach used to determine fair values 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis we use a discount rate that reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value longterm growth rates provisions for income taxes future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless debtfree working capital 

2016 annual goodwill impairment test 

critical assumptions that the company used in performing the income approach for its reporting units included the following 



 



 





 



  



changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units our forecasts take into account the near and longterm expected business performance considering the longterm market conditions and business trends within the reporting units for further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions see “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k and our other filings with the sec

market approaches used to determine fair values 

each year we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value 

the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance the “public company method” these multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the company the “quoted price method” the third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publiclytraded and privatelyheld companies in our industries the “mergers and acquisition method” 

the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include current and forward 12month operating performance results as applicable and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied under the public company and the quoted price methods a control premium or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units we also compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions if the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates andor other assumptions 

for the 2014 2015 and 2016 annual goodwill impairment review of the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units we evaluated each of the above market approaches and determined that the public company and quoted price methods provided the most reliable measures of fair value because they were deemed to be a reliable proxy for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units in 2015 and 2016 we also included the mergers and acquisition method since it also provided a reliable measure of fair value and was deemed to be a reliable proxy for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units we applied a combined weighting of 20 to the market approaches when determining the fair value of each of the reporting units in each year for the 2014 2015 and 2016 annual goodwill impairment review of the packaging solutions product care and medical applications reporting units we also evaluated each of the above market approaches and determined that the public company the quoted price and the mergers and acquisition methods provided the most reliable measures of fair value because they were deemed to be a reliable proxy for these reporting units we applied a combined weighting of 20 to the three market approaches when determining the fair value of these reporting units 

if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change such as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock a decline in current market multiples a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates an adverse action or assessment by a regulator heightened competition strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair values of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount ranging from approximately 73 to approximately 475 of the carrying amounts we will continue to monitor goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in management’s business strategy or significant declines in our stock price indicate that there may be potential indicator of impairment 

see note 7 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2016 2015 and 2014 and other related information 

pensions 

for a number of our us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 for all material plans november 30 for nonmaterial plans 

at december 31 2016 the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans was 213 million and the total benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2016 was 3 million at december 31 2016 the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 11 billion and the total benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2016 was 9 million 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2016 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2017 in millions 

 



 



 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carry forwards and foreign tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized on the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 16 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

at december 31 2016 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps and no outstanding interest rate collars or options

see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 85 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2016 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2016 would have caused us to pay approximately 50 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference

during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forwards totaling €270 million these foreign currency exchange forwards hedged a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and expired in june 2015 the loss of 4 million 2 million after tax is recorded in aoci on our consolidated balance sheet 

the €400 million 450 notes issued in june 2015 are designated as a net investment hedge hedging a portion of our net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the change in the fair value of the debt was 29 million 18 million after tax at december 31 2016 and is reflected in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet 

in march 2015 we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps with a combined notional amount of 425 million hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the fair value of this hedge as of december 31 2016 was 5 million 3 million after tax on our consolidated balance sheet semiannual interest settlements resulted in aoci of 14 million 9 million after tax 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in other income net on the consolidated statements of operations 

other derivative instruments 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 875 million at december 31 2016 and 1 billion at december 31 2015 

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 4 million in 2016 4 million in 2015 and 8 million in 2014 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 20 million at december 31 2016 and 25 million at december 31 2015

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2016 we expect our net periodic benefit income to be approximately 3 million in 2017 see note 14 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2015 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

seasonality 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season net sales in our diversey care segment have tended to be higher in the second quarter due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price there are also other companies producing competing products that are wellestablished since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership we invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year as compared with our packaging peers 

there are other manufacturers of food care products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the us 

our food care hygiene solutions and diversey care solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across each p roduct category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach we compete globally on premium product offerings and application expertise innovative pr oduct and dispensing equipment offerings valueadded solution delivery and strong customer service and support we differentiate our offerings from competitors by becoming the preferred partner to our customers and by providing innovative industrylead ing products to make their facilities safer and healthier for both maintenance staff and building occupants we believe our integrated solutions approach which includes the supply of machines tools chemicals processes and training to customers to drive productivity improvements reduce total cost of ownership reduce risk of food safety events and improve infection control to reduce healthcare acquired infections is a unique competitive strength additionally the quality ease of use and environmental profile of our products are unique and have helped support longstanding profitable relationships with many top customers 

our product care products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts wood blocking and bracing systems and a portfolio of automated packaging and fulfillment systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products additionally due to internal technology development investments and due to the acquisition of b equipment in 2015 we are a leader in automated void reduction systems technology and automated mailer technology 

competition for most of our medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price 

raw materials and purchasing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components contract manufactured goods equipment and other direct materials such as inks films and paper our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins as well as chemicals such as caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants chelates fragrances paper and wood pulp products raw materials represent approximately onethird of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials baginthebox containers bottles drums pails totes aerosol cans caps triggers valves and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment dilutioncontrol warewashing and laundry equipment floor care machines and items used in the maintenance of a facility such as air care dispensers floor care applicators microfiber mops and cloths buckets carts and other cleaning tools and utensils 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we purchase some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global purchasing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of purchasing and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent purchasing practices 

research and development activities 

we maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and improve our existing products and processes including developing new packaging chemical formulations and equipment and related applications using our intellectual property from time to time we also license or acquire technology developed by others our research and development projects rely on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science chemistry and chemical engineering package design and equipment engineering our research and development expense was 129 million in 2015 135 million in 2014 and 133 million in 2013

our research and development activities are focused on enduse application as a result we operate 







patents and trademarks 

we are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over 4000 us and foreign patents and patent applications as well as an aggregate of over 10600 united states and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage we file annually an average of 200 us and foreign patent applications and 400 us and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements in the us we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the us environmental protection agency “epa” we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees

risk factors 

tableend

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers hotels restaurants retail establishments other retailers business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in 62 countries and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the us and a majority of our net sales are generated outside of the us these operations particularly in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 



























in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

fluctuations between foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 62 of our net sales in 2015 were generated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements as a result the company is exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results back to us dollars during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars the company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on its future operating results as exchange rates vary the companys results of operations and profitability may be harmed while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from foreign currency variations the gains or losses associated with hedging activities may harm the companys results of operations

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards — impact of inflation and currency fluctuation— venezuela” 

political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows

we are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or regions in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including civil unrest acts of terrorism sabotage epidemics force majeure war or other armed conflict and related government actions including sanctionsembargoes the deprivation of contract rights the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials the expropriation or nationalization of our assets and restrictions on travel payments or the movement of funds in particular if additional restrictions on trade with russia were adopted by the european union or the us and were applicable to our products we could lose sales and experience lower growth rates in the future​

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiari es and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contract ual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indenture governing certain of our senior notes these notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiari es we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 





















in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 









in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2015 we had 1264 billion of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 16 million increase or a 16 million decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical based raw materials and energy could increase our costs in addition the prices of many of the other key raw materials used in our businesses such as caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants polymers and resins chelates and fragrances are cyclical based on numerous supply and demand factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

unfavorable consumer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings 

from time to time and especially in periods of rising raw material costs we increase the prices of our products significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by the customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact earnings 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors including our earnings in the us 

we have deferred tax assets including state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards foreign tax credits accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income within each respective jurisdiction during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize the assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us andor certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets our effective tax rate would increase if we were required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets

our most significant deferred tax asset is our foreign tax credit carryforwards the benefit from the amount carried forward may depend upon many factors including the jurisdictional mix of our anticipated future earnings a reduction in our anticipated us earnings or an unfavorable mix of domestic versus foreignsourced us earnings may change our foreign tax credit position which could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods in which any such condition occurs in addition changes in statutory tax rates or other legislation or re gulation may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate 

we may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs

we have implemented a number of restructuring programs in the last few years including our fusion program earnings quality improvement program eqip and integration and optimization program iop these programs include various cost savings and reorganization initiatives including the relocation of our corporate headquarters to charlotte north carolina the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount we have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities these assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors in addition our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control if we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as porcine epidemic diarrhea or “ped” bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as “mad cow” disease footandmouth disease avian influenza or “birdflu” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products in recent years occasional cases of ped and “mad cow” disease have been confirmed and incidents of birdflu have surfaced in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system

we are currently engaged in a multiyear process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system “erp” the erp is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes accurately maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team the erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties as a result any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders apply cash receipts place purchase orders with suppliers and make cash disbursements and could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations which may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades to those systems while we implement the new erp system while we have invested significant resources in planning and project management significant implementation issues may arise

although the settlement agreem ent as defined in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transact ion with grace as defined below if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan as defined below and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if grace were unwilling or unable to defend and inde mnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we are also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 sealed air completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities since the beginning of 2000 we have been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction we are responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries while they vary these suits all appear to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders dated may 3 2001 and january 22 2002 staying all asbestos actions against the company the “preliminary injunction” however the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” received the court’s permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction this proceeding was brought in the us district court for the district of delaware the “district court” adv no 0202210 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates in connection with the cryovac transaction the settlement agreement provided for the resolution of the fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction the parties to the agreement in principle signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court signed an order approving the settlement agreement although grace is not a party to the settlement agreement under the terms of the order grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions 

on september 19 2008 grace the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the asbestos pi future claimants’ representative and the official committee of equity security holders filed as coproponents a plan of reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the “plan” and several exhibits and associated documents including a disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court the plan provides for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the united states bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the plan incorporates the settlement agreement including our payment of amounts contemplated by the settlement agreement and the releases and injunctions contemplated by the settlement agreement 

on february 3 2014 the “effective date” the plan implementing the settlement agreement became effective with grace emerging from bankruptcy in accordance with the plan and the settlement agreement on the effective date cryovac inc made aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and transferred 18 million shares of sealed air common stock to the pi trust in each case reflecting adjustments made in accordance with the settlement agreement under the plan the preliminary injunction remained in place through the effective date and on the effective date the plan and settlement agreement injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims became effective following the effective date the bankruptcy court issued an order dismissing the proceedings pursuant to which the preliminary injunction was issued the plan further provides for the channeling of existing and future asbestos claims to the pi trust or the pd trust as applicable in addition under the plan and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

since november 2004 the company a nd specified subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of grace’s alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos containing product s in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace has agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by grace has been approved by the canadian court and the plan provides for payment of these claims we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us became operative upon the effective dat e of a plan of reorganization in grace’s united states chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code as i ndicated above the bankruptcy court entered the bankruptcy court confirmation order on january 31 2011 and the clarifying order on february 15 2011 and the district court entered the original district court confirmation order on january 30 2012 and the amended district court confirmation order on june 11 2012 the canadian court issued an order on april 8 2011 recognizing and giving full effect to the bankruptcy court’s confirmation order in all provinces and territories of canada in accordance with t he bankruptcy court confirmation order’s terms as described above the plan became effective on february 3 2014 in accordance with an order of the canadian court on the effective date the actions became permanently stayed until they are amended to rem ove the grace parties as named defendants two actions were dismissed by the manitoba court as against the grace parties on february 19 2014 the remaining actions were either dismissed or discontinued with prejudice by the canadian courts as against the grace parties in may and june 2015 but for two actions in the province of quebec for which motions to dismiss are pending notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay damages which we cannot estimate at this time for furth er information concerning these matters see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” 

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in the food processing and food service industries consumer preferences for food and packaging formats of prepackaged food can influence our sales as can consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods changes in consumer behavior including changes in consumer preferences driven by various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

customers in the food service food and beverage processing building care lodging industrial distribution and healthcare sectors have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

the market for our hygiene products is highly competitive our hygiene products businesses face significant competition from global national regional and local companies within some or all of our product lines in each sector that we serve barriers to entry and expansion in the institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene industry are low 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products additionally we may not successfully implement our pricing actions these factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

concerns about greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials and freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits it is also possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit market s could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

strengthening of the us dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 62 of our net sales in 2015 were generated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 

also while we often produce in the same geographic markets as our products are sold expenses are more concentrated in the us than sales so that in a time of strengthening of the us dollar our profit margins could be reduced while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards — impact of inflation and currency fluctuation— venezuela” 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens and a more stringent manner in which they are applied particularly in the us could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole this includes among other things the possible taxation under us law of certain income from foreign operations compliance costs and enforcement under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act and costs associated with complying with the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder

for example under section 1502 of the doddfrank act the sec has adopted additional disclosure requirements related to the source of certain “conflict minerals” for issuers for which such “conflict minerals” are necessary to the functionality or product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by that issuer the metals covered by the rules include tin tantalum tungsten and gold commonly referred to as “3tg” our suppliers may use some or all of these materials in their production processes the secs rules require us to perform due diligence on our suppliers global supply chains can have multiple layers thus the costs of complying with these requirements could be substantial these requirements may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices compliance costs and the unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as another example the affordable care act the “aca” which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years significantly affects the provision of both healthcare services and benefits in the us the aca may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business we provide benefits to our employees which are competitive within the industries in which we operate the aca did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2015 2014 or 2013 however we are continuing to assess the impact of the aca on our healthcare benefit costs the regulatory environment is still developing and the potential exists for future legislation and regulations to be adopted these developments as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure we are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies adverse developments in these laws or regulations or any change in position regarding the application administration or interpretation thereof in any applicable jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations in addition the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the us may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations

our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and third party information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations 

we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

as a result of previous acquisitions including diversey we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and we may never realize the full carrying value of these assets 

as a result of certain acquisitions including the acquisition of diversey we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intan gible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment may result from among other things i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessme nt by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold o r disposed of in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liabilities claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

the relationship with sc johnson  son inc “scj” is important to our diversey care segment and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on this segment 

diversey is party to various agreements with scj under which it is granted a license in specified territories to sell certain scj products and use specified trade names owned by scj in the institutional and industrial channels of trade and subject to certain limitations in specified channels of trade in which both our diversey care segment and scj’s consumer business operate which expires in 2017 although the term of this agreement may be extended it is uncertain the parties will agree to do so if we default under our agreements with scj and the agreements are terminated we are not able to amicably resolve any disputes in accordance with the terms of the agreements scj fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with scj is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our diversey care segment consolidated financial condition or results of operations

the relationship with unilever plc “unilever” is important to our diversey care segment and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on this segment 

diversey is a party to various agreements with unilever under which it is granted a license to produce and sell professional size packs of unilever’s consumer brand cleaning products in the institutional and industrial channels of trade which expires at the end of 2017 with the exception of a subset of the uk business which expires at the end of 2022 although the term of this agreement may be extended it is uncertain that the parties will agree to do so in addition diversey also holds licenses to use some trademarks and technology of unilever in the market for institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene products and related services if we default under our agreements with unilever and the agreements are terminated unilever fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with unilever is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our diversey care segment consolidated financial condition or results of operations

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies if any of our senior management or other key personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we coul d experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business 

we are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water and the use handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our european operations as a result of a european union “eu” directive “registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals” eu directive no 20061907 enacted on december 18 2006 the directive imposes several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical substances manufactured or marketed in europe the eu has also recently enacted a “classification packaging and labeling” regulation other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the legacy diversey business had tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever pursuant to the unilever acquisition agreement as defined below 

under a previous acquisition agreement between the legacy diversey business and unilever the “unilever acquisition agreement” unilever made warranties to diversey with respect to the facilities formerly owned by unilever in addition unilever agreed to indemnify diversey for specified types of environmental liabilities if the aggregate amount of damages meets various dollar thresholds subject to a cap of 250 million in the aggregate diversey was required to notify unilever of any environmental indemnification claims by may 3 2008 any environmental claims pending after this date with respect to which diversey has notified unilever remain subject to indemnification until remediation is completed in accordance with the unilever acquisition agreement 

diversey has previously tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever in connection with former unilever locations unilever has not indicated its agreement with diversey’s request for indemnification we may file additional requests for reimbursement in the future in connection with pending indemnification claims however there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover any amounts relating to these indemnification claims from unilever 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of o ur coverage could adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that are not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products this loss of a competitive advantage could result in decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countries where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the us and in the foreign countries in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to mitigate these risks our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and th ose of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information im proper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our cons olidated financial condition and results of operations

medical and other we produce medical applications and other products in 5 manufacturing facilities of which 2 are in north america and 3 are in emea 

other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the us and in many foreign countries some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some on those that we lease standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters are currently located in a leased facility in charlotte north carolina we began construction of our permanent facility which is anticipated to be completed by the first quarter of 2017 for a list of those countries outside of the us where we have operations see “global operations” above 

we believe that our manufacturing warehouse office and other facilities are well maintained suitable for their purposes and adequate for our needs

the information set forth in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2015 w e were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “superfund” sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2015 environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the futu re impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financ ial condition or results of operations 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

the information in this mda should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in part ii item 8 as well as the discussion included in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k all amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions except per share amounts 

on december 6 2013 we completed the sale of the rigid medical packaging business and accordingly the operating results were reclassified to discontinued operations net of tax on the consolidated statements of operations for 2013 see note 3 “divestitures and acquisitions” for further details all results and discussion included in this mda are presented on a continuing operations basis 

we report our segment information in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 280 “segment reporting” “fasb asc topic 280” the company’s segment reporting structure consists of three reportable segments and an “other” category and is as follows 









see note 4 “segments” for further information 

overview 

we are a global leader in food safety and security facility hygiene and product protection we serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing food service retail healthcare and industrial and commercial and consumer applications our focus is on achieving quality sales growth through leveraging our geographic footprint technological knowhow and leading market positions to bring measureable sustainable value to our customers employees and investors we have widely recognized and inventive brands such as cryovac ® packaging technology diversey ® and taski ® brand cleaning and hygiene solutions and our bubble wrap ® brand cushioning jiffy ® protective mailers and instapak ® foaminplace systems 

as of december 31 2015 we employed approximately 7100 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2015 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season net sales in our diversey care segment have tended to be higher in the second quarter due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be higher in the second half of the year reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership our food care hygiene solutions and diversey care solutions businesses face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach for more details see “competition” included in part i item 1 “business” 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochem icalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders 

highlights of financial performance 

below are the highlights of our financial performance for the three years ended december 31 2015

foreign currency translation impact on consolidated financial results 

since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated financial results into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our financial results from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact historically the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro the australian dollar the brazilian real the british pound the canadian dollar the mexican peso and the venezuelan bolivar 

the following table presents the approximate favorable or unfavorable impact foreign currency translation had on some of our consolidated financial results 

 



 

net sales by geographic region

components of change in net sales by segment 

the following tables present the components of change in net sales by our segment reporting structure for 2015 compared with 2014 and 2014 compared with 2013 we also present the change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation a nonus gaap measure which we define as “constant dollar” we believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability between periods as it eliminates the volatility of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 



 





the following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis

2015 compared with 2014 

cost of sales was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 492 million on a constant dollar basis cost of sales decreased 126 million or 3 primarily due to





these were partially offset by



we anticipate raw material costs in 2016 to be in line with 2015 however we expect an unfavorable impact related to foreign currency while we will maintain our focus on valueadded selling and pricing disciplines our pricing actions could be placed under negative pressure due to competitive pricing and our formula pricing structure primarily in our food care division 

2014 compared with 2013 

cost of sales was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 125 million on a constant dollar basis cost of sales increased 87 million or 2 primarily due to





these factors were partially offset by favorable impact of cost savings of 47 million and other supply chain efficiencies

restructuring activities 

 

see note 9 “restructuring and relocation activities” for additional details regarding each of the company’s restructuring programs discussed below restructuring plan’s accrual spending and other activity for the year ended december 31 2015 

 

fusion

on december 18 2014 the board of directors of the company approved a new restructuring plan the “fusion program” or the “plan” which consists of a portfolio of restructuring projects across all of our divisions as part of our transformation of sealed air corporation into a knowledgebased company including reduction in headcount and consolidation and relocation of certain facilities and offices including the relocation of the company’s headquarters to charlotte nc as announced on july 23 2014 the cost of the charlotte campus is estimated to be approximately 120 million the net cash cost of the plan is now expected to be in the range of 330 million to 340 million

the company currently estimates that it will incur aggregate costs of approximately 395 million to 405 million in connection with the implementation of this plan which compares to previously reported estimates of 275 million to 285 million the increase represents our decision to build and own the new campus in charlotte north carolina rather than lease it and improved estimates of the costs of implementing the plan primarily related to relocation expenses the costs associated with the plan the majority of which are expected to be incurred primarily between 2015 and 2017 largely consist of i a reduction in headcount through reorganization and integration including severance and termination benefits for employees expected to be approximately 115 million to 120 million and ii other costs associated with the plan primarily relating to the building costs of the charlotte campus rationalization consolidation and relocation of certain portions of our global supply chain and other facilities and offices expected to be approximately 280 million to 285 million included in the total cash costs the company anticipates approximately 190 million to 200 million of capital expenditures related to the plan including the building of the charlotte campus of which the majority is expected to be incurred in 2016 

the plan is currently estimated to generate annualized savings of approximately 90 million to 100 million by the end of 2018 additionally the plan is expected to generate cash and benefits of approximately 65 million from the sale of certain assets state and local incentives in connection with the relocation of the company’s headquarters and reductions in working capital as of december 31 2015 we generated 30 million in cash related to the sale of our facility located in racine wisconsin and have achieved 18 million of incremental cost savings primarily in selling general and administration expenses in 2015 related to this program compared with the same period in 2014

earnings quality improvement program eqip 

on may 1 2013 we commenced with our eqip which is an initiative to deliver meaningful cost savings and network optimization the plan is estimated to generate annualized savings of approximately 90110 million by the end of 2016 we achieved 36 million incremental cost savings in 2015 related to this program compared with 2014 we achieved these savings in cost of sales 15 million and in selling general and administrative expenses 21 million primarily in our food care and diversey care divisions

integration and optimization program iop 

in december 2011 we initiated a restructuring program associated with the integration of diversey’s business following our acquisition of diversey on october 3 2011 this program was substantially completed by the end of 2015 we achieved 6 million incremental cost savings in 2015 related to this program compared with 2014 we achieved these savings in cost of sales 1 million and in selling general and administrative expenses 5 million primarily in our food care and diversey care divisions 

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to the programs described above and our relocation activities is subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later than expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending and benefits and cost savings see note 9 “restructuring and relocation activities” for further discussion of the costs cash payments and liabilities associated with these programs and relocation activities 

adjusted ebitda by segment 

the company utilizes adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure as the measure in which management assesses segment performance and makes allocation decisions by segment adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude the impact of special items see “use of nonus gaap information” above for a discussion of special items and further information of our use of nonus gaap measures 

we allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments although property and equipment net is not allocated to the segment assets nor is depreciation and amortization included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda we also allocate and disclose restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment although it is not included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda since restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are categorized as special items the accounting policies of the reportable segments and other are the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements 

see note 4 “segments” for the reconciliation of nonus gaap adjusted ebitda to us gaap net earnings from continuing operations and other segment details

loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities 

in the second quarter 2015 we issued 400 million of 550 senior notes due september 15 2025 and €400 million of 450 senior notes due september 15 2023 the proceeds from these notes were used to repurchase the company’s 750 million 8375 notes due september 2021 the aggregate repurchase price was 866 million which included the principal amount of 750 million a premium of 99 million and accrued interest of 17 million we recognized a total pretax loss of 110 million on the repurchase which included the premiums mentioned above also included in the loss on debt redemption was 11 million of accelerated amortization of original nonlender fees related to the 8375 senior notes

see note 11 “debt and credit facilities” for details of our debt transactions 

sale of equity investment

in september 2007 we established a joint venture that supported our food care segment in turkey we accounted for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of net income or losses included in other expense net on the consolidated statements of operations in the second quarter of 2012 we recorded otherthantemporary impairment of 26 million 18 million net of taxes or 009 per diluted share this impairment primarily consisted of the recognition of a current liability for the guarantee we issued related to the uncommitted credit facility of 20 million the other component of the impairment was a 4 million writedown of the carrying value of the investment to zero at june 30 2012 we also recorded provisions for bad debt on receivables due from the joint venture to the company of 2 million which was included in marketing administrative and development expenses

in the second quarter of 2015 sealed air sold its equity interest in the joint venture which had a carrying value of zero and in connection with the closing of this sale sealed air and the other partner had to pay a portion of the outstanding debt that the joint vent ure owed for which sealed air had recorded a current liability in 2012 at closing sealed air also collected its outstanding receivables and paid certain payables to the joint venture in july 2015 the partner paid the remaining outstanding debt balan ce and sealed air was relieved of its remaining guarantee obligation therefore the remaining liability for the guarantee was reversed as a result of these transactions we recorded in 2015 pretax income of 91 million which was reflected as a specia l item and is excluded from our adjusted ebitda results included in this amount was 66 million related to the portion of the debt that the partner paid which is reflected in other income expense net 20 million due to the reversal of allowance for bad debts which is reflected in selling general and administrative expenses and in other income expense net and 05 million related to the impact of the revaluation of the nonus dollardenominated contingent liability and the related foreign curre ncy forward contracts which was included in other income net 

impairment of equity method investments 

in 2014 and 2013 we recognized an impairment of 6 million and 2 million respectively in connection with equity method investments these investments were not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

the impairments are considered special items and excluded from our adjusted ebitda results

foreign currency exchange losses gains related to venezuelan subsidiaries 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy the foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2015 2014 and 2013 for our venezuelan subsidiary were the result of the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements at the balance sheet date we believe these gains and losses are attributable to the unstable foreign currency environment in venezuela see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards – impact of inflation and currency fluctuation  venezuela” for further details

gain from claims settlement 

on february 3 2014 we entered into the settlement agreement under the settlement agreement we released and waived certain claims against the grace parties and the grace parties released and waived certain claims against us as a result we recognized a gain of 21 million in 2014 which consisted of the release of 17 million of certain tax liabilities and 4 million of other associated liabilities see note 17 “commitments and contingencies – settlement agreement and related costs” for more details on the settlement agreement

other income expense net 

see note 20 “other income expense net” for the components and discussion of other income expense net 

income taxes 

the table below shows our effective income tax rate from continuing operations “etr” 

 



 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 212 for 2015 the primary adjustments to the statutory rate were the following











tax expense for 2015 includes an 11 million benefit from adjustments that would appropriately be recorded in a prior period but which the company has determined are not material to the prior year or current year financial statements and therefore included the adjustments in the current year these items include income from overall foreign loss recapture benefit from recognition of foreign tax credits deferred tax adjustments and additional domestic taxable income from foreign sources

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 34 for 2014 primarily due to a favorable earnings mix in jurisdictions with lower tax rates in addition our effective tax rate benefited from the release of reserves due to favorable settlements judicial verdicts and expiration of statute of limitations 23 million and the release of a valuation allowance from a favorable tax settlement of approximately 13 million 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 471 for 2013 primarily due to an increase of approximately 50 million as a result of not funding the settlement agreement before the end of 2013 the delay in funding required us to increase our valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to the settlement agreement excluding that increase our tax rate would have been approximately 19 our tax rate for the year benefited from a favorable earnings mix in jurisdictions with lower tax rates as well as various reorganizations and a retroactive reinstatement of certain tax provisions that were recorded as discrete items in 2013 

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carry back any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences the future income from existing temporary differences and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reverse those valuation allowances

liquidity and capital resources 

principal sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our amended credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses investments in working capital capital expenditures interest taxes stock repurchases dividends debt obligations restructuring expenses and other longterm liabilities we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months 

on february 3 2014 we funded the 930 million settlement agreement and accrued interest liability using cash on hand and committed liquidity to fund the cash payment we used 555 million of cash and cash equivalents and utilized borrowings of 260 million from our revolving credit facility and 115 million from our accounts receivable securitization programs also on february 14 2014 we repaid our 12 senior notes on their maturity date with available cash on hand and committed liquidity see note 11 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

as of december 31 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents of 358 million of which approximately 345 million or 96 was located outside of the us as of december 31 2015 there were certain foreign government regulations restricting transfers on less than 25 million of the cash located outside of the us as of december 31 2015 our us cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to us borrowers were sufficient to fund our us operating requirements and capital expenditures current debt obligations and dividends the company does not expect that in the near term cash located outside of the us will be needed to satisfy its obligations dividends and other demands for cash in its us operations 

material commitments and c ontingencies 

settlement agreement and related costs 

we recorded a pretax charge of 850 million in 2002 of which 513 million represented a cash payment that was due upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of w r grace  co 

on february 3 2014 upon grace’s emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization the settlement agreement was implemented and our subsidiary cryovac inc made the payments contemplated by the settlement agreement consisting of aggregate cash payments in the amount of 930 million to the pi trust and the pd trust and the transfer of 18 million shares of sealed air common stock the “settlement shares” to the pi trust in each case reflecting adjustments made in accordance with the settlement agreement 

on february 3 2014 we funded the cash portion of the settlement payment by using 555 million of accumulated cash and cash equivalents and utilized borrowings of 260 million from our revolving credit facility and 115 million from our accounts receivable securitization programs see “principal sources of liquidity” below the cash payment of 513 million accrued interest at a 55 annual rate which was compounded annually from december 21 2002 to the february 3 2014 date of payment this accrued interest was 413 million at december 31 2013 and was recorded in settlement agreement and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheet the total liability on our consolidated balance sheet was 925 million at december 31 2013 in addition the settlement agreement provided for the issuance of the 18 million settlement shares since the impact of issuing the settlement shares was dilutive to our eps under us gaap they were included in our diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in our calculation of eps to the extent that the impact of including these shares were dilutive see note 21 “net earnings per common share” for details of our calculation of eps 

we deducted the settlement payment in our 2014 consolidated us income tax return as a result we had a net operating loss for us tax purposes in 2014 and carried back for 10 years more than 1 billion of the loss 

we increased our unrecognized tax benefits by 104 million in 2015 for the recording of a reserve related to the settlement payment while the company believes it is more likely than not it will be successful the ultimate outcome of negotiations may affect the utilization of certain tax attributes and require us to return all or a portion of the refund

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an increase to the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset related to the settlement agreement which resulted in an increase of approximately 50 million to our income tax provision approximately 023 per diluted share

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us gaap therefore it should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures including certain debt servicing requirements or nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure we typically generate the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year below find details of free cash flow for three years ended december 31 2015 

 



 







changes in working capital 

 



 

the 483 million or 54 decrease in working capital in the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in other receivables due to the tax refund received related to the settlement agreement a decrease in trade receivables and an increase in accounts payable reflecting higher days payable outstanding consistent with initiatives for longer payment terms and an increase in shortterm borrowings consistent with our share repurchase activity

changes in stockholders’ equity 

the 636 million or 55 decrease in stockholders’ equity in 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to











partially offset by 





the company repurchased approximately 161 million shares of its common stock in 2015 for 802 million at an average price of 4973 per share this includes 05 million shares purchased under our march asr program for 25 million at an average price of 4574 per share and 58 million shares purchased under our august asr program for 299 million at an average price of 5176 per share see note 18 “stockholders’ equity” for further details

in 2015 we recorded an excess tax benefit of 46 million as an out of period adjustment related to the settlement agreement resulting from an increase in the value of the company’s common stock related to the 18 million shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the settlement agreement in 2002 until its settlement on february 3 2014 the tax benefit was recorded to additional paidin capital on our consolidated balance sheet and did not impact net earnings

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel thirdparty experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of trade receivables as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the likelihood of failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed at a minimum quarterly and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts which is included in selling general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations these changes may reflect changes in economic business and market conditions the allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of chargeoffs net of recoveries 

the provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including but not limited to a regular assessment of the collectability of specific customer balances the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with our customers in circumstances where a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations is known we record a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount we reasonably assess will be collected if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to pay our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount 

fair value measurements of financial instruments 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 







our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for further details on our fair value measurements 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability and we expect to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite–lived intangible assets such as inprocess research and development and trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review other than for inprocess research and development assets we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment — the “component” level — discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in 2014 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units 

the goodwill impairment test involves a twostep process in step one we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must perform step two of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment we must recognize a noncash impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value 

fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis noneth eless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units assumptions for sales net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

income approach used to determine fair values 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis we use a discount rate that reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value longterm growth rates provisions for income taxes future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless debtfree working capital 

2015 annual goodwill impairment test 

critical assumptions that the company used in performing the income approach for its reporting units included the following 



 



 





 



 



changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units our forecasts take into account the near and longterm expected business performance considering the longterm market conditions and business trends within the reporting units for further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions see “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k and our other filings with the sec

market approaches used to determine fair values 

each year we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value 

the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance the “public company method” these multiples are derived from comparable public lytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the company the “quoted price method” the third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publiclytraded and privatelyheld companies in our industries the “mergers and acquisition method”  

the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include current and forward 12month operating performance results as applicable and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied under the public company and the quoted price methods a control premium or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units we also compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions if the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates andor other assumptions 

for the 2013 2014 and 2015 annual goodwill impairment review of the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units we evaluated each of the above market approaches and determined that the public company and quoted price methods provided the most reliable measures of fair value because they were deemed to be a reliable proxy for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units in 2015 we also included the mergers and acquisition method since it also provided a reliable measure of fair value and was deemed to be a reliable proxy for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units we applied a combined weighting of 20 to the market approaches when determining the fair value of each of the reporting units in each year for the 2013 2014 and 2015 annual goodwill impairment review of the packaging solutions product care and medical applications reporting units we also evaluated each of the above market approaches and determined that the public company the quoted price and the mergers and acquisition methods provided the most reliable measures of fair value because they were deemed to be a reliable proxy for these reporting units we applied a combined weighting of 20 to the three market approaches when determining the fair value of these reporting units 

if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change such as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock a decline in current market multiples a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates an adverse action or assessment by a regulator heightened competition strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair values of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount ranging from approximately 39 to approximately 727 of the carrying amounts we will continue to monitor goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in management’s business strategy or significant declines in our stock price indicate that there may be potential indicator of impairment 

see note 7 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2015 2014 and 2013 and other related information 

pensions 

for a number of our us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on t hirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation is december 31 for all material plans november 30 for nonmaterial plans the measurement date used to determine the plan assets is december 31 for all plans

at december 31 2015 the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans was 215 million and the total benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2015 was 1 million at december 31 2015 the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 11 billion and the total benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2015 was 9 million 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2015 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2016 in millions 

 



 



 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carry forwards and foreign tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which d eferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results diffe r from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized on the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 16 “income taxes” for further discussion 



we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

at december 31 2015 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps and no outstanding interest rate collars or options

the information set forth in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 109 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2015 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

venezuela 

economic and political events in venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards – impact of inflation and currency fluctuation  venezuela” for additional details

argentina

recent economic events in argentina including the default on some of its international debt obligations have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks however as of december 31 2015 we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact to our 2016 outlook discussed above for 2015 about 2 of our consolidated net sales and operating income were derived from our businesses in argentina as of december 31 2015 we had net assets of 23 million including 6 million of cash and cash equivalents in argentina

russia

the us and the european union eu have recently imposed sanctions on various sectors of the russian economy and on transactions with certain russian nationals and entities russia has also announced economic sanctions against the us and other nations that include a ban on imports of certain products these sanctions are not expected to have a material impact on our business as much of the operations in russia support local production however they may limit the amount of future business the company does with customers involved in activities in russia as of december 31 2015 less than 2 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into russia   

greece

recent economic events in greece including missing payment to the international monetary fund and the uncertainties relating to the ability of greece to remain in the european monetary union may require us to tighten credit controls that will have adverse impact on our sales and bad debt expense however as of december 31 2015 we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2016 results of operations as of december 31 2015 less than 1 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into greece

brazil

recent economic events in brazil including the increase in the benchmark interest rate set by the brazilian central bank have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks however as of december 31 2015 we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2016 results of operations as of december 31 2015 less than 3 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into brazil

impact of inflation and currency fluctuation 

economic and political events in certain countries have exposed us to heightened levels of inflation and foreign currency exchange risks the effects of these could impact our financial condition and results of operations see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding the impact of inflation and currency fluctuation also for a discussion of our risk factors please refer to part ii item 1a “risk factors”

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2015 would have caused us to pay approximately 50 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in part ii item 8 and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference 

interest rate and currency swap 

in connection with exercising the 100 million delayed draw under the senior secured credit facility we entered into a series of interest rate and currency swaps these swaps convert the us dollar denominated variable rate obligation under the credit facility into a fixed rate brazilian real denominated obligation the delayed draw and the interest rate and currency swaps are used to fund expansion and general corporate purposes of our brazilian subsidiaries

net investment hedge

during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forwards totaling €270 million these foreign currency exchange forwards hedged a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and expired in june 2015 the loss of 35 million 22 million after tax is recorded in aoci on our consolidated balance sheet 

the €400 million 450 notes issued in june 2015 are designated as a net investment hedge hedging a portion of our net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the change in the fair value of the debt was 124 million 76 million after tax at december 31 2015 and is reflected in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet 

in march 2015 we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps with a combined notional amount of 425 million hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the fair value of this hedge as of december 31 2015 was 120 million 74 million after tax on our consolidated balance sheet semiannual interest settlements resulted in aoci of 59 million 36 million after tax 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in other income net on the consolidated statements of operations 

other derivative instruments

during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange options to partially protect the company’s eurodenominated earnings from a decline in the value of the euro the options have expired as of december 31 2015

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 1 billion at december 31 2015 and 500 million at december 31 2014 

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 4 million in 2015 8 million in 2014 and 12 million in 2013 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 25 million at december 31 2015 and 29 million at december 31 2014 

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2015 we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately 9 million in 2016 see note 14 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

recent economic events in brazil including the increase in the benchmark interest rate set by the brazilian central bank have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks however as of december 31 2015 we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact on our 2016 results of operations as of december 31 2015 less than 3 of our consolidated net sales were derived from products sold into brazil

impact of inflation and currency fluctuation 

economic and political events in certain countries have exposed us to heightened levels of inflation and foreign currency exchange risks the effects of these could impact our financial condition and results of operations see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for details regarding the impact of inflation and currency fluctuation also for a discussion of our risk factors please refer to part ii item 1a “risk factors”

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2015 would have caused us to pay approximately 50 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in part ii item 8 and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference 

interest rate and currency swap 

in connection with exercising the 100 million delayed draw under the senior secured credit facility we entered into a series of interest rate and currency swaps these swaps convert the us dollar denominated variable rate obligation under the credit facility into a fixed rate brazilian real denominated obligation the delayed draw and the interest rate and currency swaps are used to fund expansion and general corporate purposes of our brazilian subsidiaries

net investment hedge

during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forwards totaling €270 million these foreign currency exchange forwards hedged a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and expired in june 2015 the loss of 35 million 22 million after tax is recorded in aoci on our consolidated balance sheet 

the €400 million 450 notes issued in june 2015 are designated as a net investment hedge hedging a portion of our net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the change in the fair value of the debt was 124 million 76 million after tax at december 31 2015 and is reflected in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet 

in march 2015 we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps with a combined notional amount of 425 million hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the fair value of this hedge as of december 31 2015 was 120 million 74 million after tax on our consolidated balance sheet semiannual interest settlements resulted in aoci of 59 million 36 million after tax 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in other income net on the consolidated statements of operations 

other derivative instruments

during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange options to partially protect the company’s eurodenominated earnings from a decline in the value of the euro the options have expired as of december 31 2015

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates and to access to international financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 1 billion at december 31 2015 and 500 million at december 31 2014 

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 4 million in 2015 8 million in 2014 and 12 million in 2013 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 25 million at december 31 2015 and 29 million at december 31 2014 

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2015 we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately 9 million in 2016 see note 14 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

reclassifications and revisions

for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 certain amounts related to foreign currency gains and losses including the remeasurement loss related to venezuelan subsidiaries in 2014 and 2013 and the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts were misclassified on the consolidated statement of cash flows the revision of the consolidated statement of cash flows for these items for the year ended december 31 2014 has no impact on cash used in operating activities resulted in a decrease to cash used in investing activities of 152 million and a decrease of 152 million related to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash the revision of the consolidated statement of cash flows for these items for the year ended december 31 2013 resulted in an increase in cash provided by operating activities of 156 million a decrease to cash used in investing activities of 85 million and an increase of in cash of 71 million related to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash 

additionally for the year ended december 31 2014 certain amounts related to external payment terms and compensating balance arrangements were misclassified in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of cash flows the revision of these items resulted in a decrease of 128 million in accounts payable and an increase of 128 million in shortterm borrowings related to extended payment terms on a vendor agreement and a decrease of 362 million in cash and an increase in other current assets 97 million and other noncurrent assets 265 million related to cash deposits held in compensating balance arrangement for certain shortterm borrowing agreements on the consolidated balance sheet the revision of these items on the consolidated statement of cash flows resulted in a decrease to cash provided by operating activities of 128 million and an increase to cash used in financing activities of 233 million

in 2015 we recorded an out of period adjustment of 46 million related to excess tax benefits from the settlement agreement refer to note 16 “income taxes” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details

on december 6 2013 we completed the sale of our rigid medical packaging business the operating results for the rigid medical packaging business were reclassified to discontinued operations net of tax on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 see note 3 “divestitures and acquisition” for further information 

in addition certain other prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation these reclassifications individually and in the aggregate had no impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows

use of estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported these estimates include among other items assessing the collectability of receivables the use and recoverability of inventory the estimation of fair value of financial instruments assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes useful lives and recoverability of tangible assets and goodwill and other intangible assets assumptions used in our defined benefit pension plans and other post employment benefit plans estimates related to selfinsurance such as the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience insurance and actuarial estimates and estimated trends in claim values fair value measurement of assets costs for incentive compensation and accruals for commitments and contingencies we review these estimates and assumptions periodically using historical experience and other factors and reflect the effects of any revisions in the consolidated financial statements in the period we determine any revisions to be necessary actual results could differ from these estimates 

financial instruments 

we may use financial instruments such as cross currency swaps interest rate swaps caps and collars us treasury lock agreements and foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options relating to our borrowing and trade activities we may use these financial instruments from time to time to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes we face credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations our policy is to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least bbb by standard  poor’s and baa3 by moody’s 

we report derivative instruments at fair value and establish criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes before entering into any derivative transaction we identify our specific financial risk the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce this risk and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument we use forecasts and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to be hedged we do not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high correlation with the underlying financial risk we are trying to reduce we regularly review our hedge positions and the correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments 

we account for derivative instruments as hedges of the related underlying risks if we designate these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments are effective as hedges of recognized assets or liabilities forecasted transactions unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions 

we record gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions are re cognized on the consolidated statements of operations at which time we recognize the gains and losses on the consolidated statements of operations we recognize gains and losses on qualifying fair value hedges and the related loss or gain on the hedged it em attributable to the hedged risk on the consolidated statements of operations 

generally our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated or if we determine the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated statements of operations over the period in which the income or expense on the underlying hedged transaction is recognized 

see note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” for further details 

fair value measurements of financial instruments 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 







our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for further details on our fair value measurements 

foreign currency translation 

in nonus locations that are not considered highly inflationary we translate the balance sheets at the end of period exchange rates with translation adjustments accumulated in stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets we translate the statements of operations at the average exchange rates during the applicable period 

we translate assets and liabilities of our operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at the end of period exchange rates except that nonmonetary asset and liability amounts are translated at historical exchange rates in countries with highly inflationary economies we translate items reflected in the statements of operations at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period except that nonmonetary amounts are translated at historical exchange rates 

impact of inflation and currency fluctuation

venezuela 

economic and political events in venezuela have continued to expose us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk accordingly venezuela has been designated a highly inflationary economy under us gaap and the us dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela all bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into us dollars using the current exchange rate available to us and any changes in the exchange rate are reflected in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our venezuelan subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of operations

on february 8 2013 the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar exchange rate from 43 bolivars to the us dollar to 63 bolivars to the us dollar we used this official exchange rate of 63 bolivars to the us dollar to remeasure the bolivardenominated assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiaries for us gaap financial statement presentation as of december 31 2013 as a result of the changes in the exchange rates we recognized a pretax loss of 13 million in 2013 due to the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiaries’ financial statements and the impact due to the settlement of bolivardenominated transactions 

on march 18 2013 the venezuelan government announced the creation of an alternative foreign currency mechanism called the supplementary foreign currency administration system known as the sicad during december 2013 the venezuelan government issued a new rule allowing the central bank to publish the average sicad rate previously it was prohibited by law to publish any rate different from the official exchange rate which was 113 bolivars per us dollar as stated above at december 31 2013 we remeasured our venezuelan subsidiaries financial statements using the official exchange rate of 63 bolivars to the us dollar since we were not eligible to use the sicad rate at that time

 

in january 2014 the government expanded the use of sicad and created a new agency called the national center of foreign commerce or cencoex which replaced the commission for the administration of foreign exchange or “cadivi” in february 2014 the government opened a new exchange called sicad 2 which would allow for more exchanges of us dollars and allow more companies the ability to obtain us dollars including for dividend remittances this market began to operate on march 24 2014 therefore there were 4 legal mechanisms at this time to exchange bolívars for us dollars









during 2014 we evaluated which legal mechanisms were available to each venezuelan subsidiary to access us dollars and also estimated the excess cash position over the next 18 months we concluded that as of december 31 2014 the excess cash position for our venezuelan subsidiaries would be remeasured at the sicad 2 rate which was 499883 at december 31 2014 since that would be the only mechanism available to access us dollars to be able to make a dividend payment for the remaining bolivar denominated cash balances and all other bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities we determined that since we still had access to and were receiving us dollars via the cencoex official rate of 63 we continued to remeasure these items at that rate as of december 31 2014 for any us dollar denominated monetary asset or liability such amounts do not get remeasured at monthend since it is already an asset or liability denominated in us dollars however such amounts were considered and included in the excess cash analysis and an evaluation of the applicable exchange mechanism such amounts could be obtained or settled at was considered as a result of this evaluation the company reported a remeasurement loss of 20 million in 2014   

in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced a new foreign exchange platform called the marginal currency system or simadi the simadi basically replaced the sicad 2 rate as noted above when this market opened on february 12 2015 the rate was 1700390 and then at december 31 2015 it was 1986986 the sicad 1 and the sicad 2 were merged into the sicad the opening rate was 12 for the sicad and at december 31 2015 it was 135 in addition the cencoex will continue and provide preferential treatment for certain import operations such as food and medicines

since these changes were announced by the venezuelan government the new simadi market has had very little activity and companies have not been able to access this market to obtain us dollars in addition the sicad rate which is established via auctions has had no auctions held since october 2014 however in june 2015 an auction was held for the automotive parts and school supplies industries

therefore there are now three legal mechanisms at this time to exchange bolivars for us dollars







at december 31 2015 we evaluated which legal mechanisms were available to our venezuelan subsidiaries to access u s dollars starting june 2015 and at december 31 2015 we concluded that we will use the simadi rate to remeasure our bolivar denominated monetary assets and liabilities since it is our only legally available option and our intent on a goforward basis to utilize this market to settle any future transactions based on the current facts and circumstances the simadi rate as of december 31 2015 was 1986986 during 2015 the company did not receive us dollars via the cencoex official rate of 63 we exp ect that we will only have limited access to the cencoex market to settle certain past transactions however if the option becomes available to us to use the cencoex in the future the company will consider this further in addition there have been no sicad auctions for the food or chemical industries as of december 31 2015 during 2015 we have only been able to access the simadi market and during 2015 only received minimal amounts of us dollars for any us dollar denominated monetary asset or l iability such amounts do not get remeasured at monthend since it is already an asset or liability denominated in us dollars as a result of this evaluation the company reported a remeasurement loss of 33 million for the year ended december 31 2015  we will continue to evaluate each reporting period the appropriate exchange rate to remeasure our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances at that time 

for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 1 of our consolidated net sales and operating income were derived from our businesses in venezuela as of december 31 2015 we had net assets of 5 million in venezuela which included cash and cash equivalents of 1 million also as of december 31 2015 our venezuelan subsidiaries had a negative cumulative translation adjustment balance of 46 million

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we make estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred 

revenue recognition 

our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products and we consider revenues to be earned when we have completed the process by which we are entitled to receive consideration the following criteria are used for revenue recognition persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists shipment has occurred selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 

sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales on the consolidated statements of operations 

charges for rebates and other allowances are recognized as a deduction from revenue on an accrual basis in the period in which the associated revenue is recorded when we estimate our rebate accruals we consider customerspecific contractual commitments including stated rebate rates and history of actual rebates paid our rebate accruals are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time we adjust the accruals to reflect any differences between estimated and actual amounts these adjustments impact the amount of net sales recognized by us in the period of adjustment charges for rebates and other allowances were approximately 9 of gross sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 we expect 2016 rebates and other allowances to be approximately the same percentage of gross sales as in 2015 

shipping and handling costs

costs incurred for the transfer and delivery of goods to customers are recorded as a component of cost of sales

research and development 

we expense research and development costs as incurred research and development costs were 129 million in 2015 135 million in 2014 and 133 million in 2013 

sharebased incentive compensation 

at the 2014 annual meeting the 2014 omnibus incentive plan the “omnibus plan” was approved by our stockholders the omnibus plan replaced the 2005 contingent stock plan and no new awards were granted under that plan any awards outstanding under the 2005 contingent stock plan on the date of stockholder approval of the omnibus plan will remain subject to and be paid under the 2005 contingent stock plan see note 18 “stockholders’ equity” for further information on this plan 

we record sharebased compensation awards exchanged for employee services at fair value on the date of grant and record the expense for these awards in cost of sales and in selling general and administrative expense as applicable on our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite employee service period sharebased incentive compensation expense includes an estimate for forfeitures and anticipated achievement levels and is generally recognized over the expected term of the award on a straightline basis 

environmental expenditures 

we expense or capitalize environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business activities as appropriate we expense costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and which do not contribute to current or future net sales we record liabilities when we determine that environmental assessments or remediation expenditures are probable and that we can reasonably estimate the associated cost or a range of costs 

income taxes 

we file a consolidated us federal income tax return our nonus subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions we provide for us income taxes on those portions of our foreign subsidiaries’ accumulated earnings that we believe are not reinvested indefinitely in our businesses 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period using enacted tax rates 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations 

see note 16 “income taxes” for further discussion 

cash and cash equivalents 

we consider highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents our policy is to invest cash in excess of shortterm operating and debt service requirements in cash equivalents cash equivalents are stated at cost which approximates fair value because of the short term maturity of the instruments our policy is to transact with counterparties that are rated at least a by standard  poor’s and a3 by moody’s some of our operations are located in countries that are rated below a or a3 in this case we try to minimize our risk by holding cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions with which we have existing global relationships whenever possible diversifying counterparty exposures and minimizing the amount held by each counterparty and within the country in total 

accounts receivable securitization programs 

we and a group of our us operating subsidiaries maintain an accounts receivable securitization program under which they sell eligible us accounts receivable to an indirectly whollyowned subsidiary that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into this program the whollyowned subsidiary in turn may sell an undivided fractional ownership interest in these receivables with two banks and an issuer of commercial paper administered by these banks the whollyowned subsidiary retains the receivables it purchases from the operating subsidiaries any transfers of undivided fractional ownership interests of receivables under the us receivables securitization program to the two banks and an issuer of commercial paper administered by these banks are considered secured borrowings with pledge of collateral and will be classified as shortterm borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets the net trade receivables that served as collateral for these borrowings are reclassified from trade receivables net to prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets

in february 2013 we entered into a european accounts receivable securitization and purchase program with a special purpose vehicle or spv two banks and a group of our european subsidiaries the european program is structured to be a securitization of certain trade receivables that are originated by certain of our european subsidiaries the spv borrows funds from the banks to fund its acquisition of the receivables and provides t he banks with a first priority perfected security interest in the accounts receivable we do not have an equity interest in the spv we concluded the spv is a variable interest entity because its total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the spv to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from the bank via loans or via the collections from accounts receivable already purchased additionally we are considered the primary beneficiary of the spv since we contr ol the activities of the spv and are exposed to the risk of uncollectable receivables held by the spv therefore the spv is consolidated in our consolidated financial statements any activity between the participating subsidiaries and the spv is elimina ted in consolidation loans from the banks to the spv will be classified as shortterm borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets the net trade receivables that served as collateral for these borrowings are reclassified from trade receivables net to p repaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

see note 8 “accounts receivable securitization programs” for further details 

trade receivables net 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria trade receivables which are included on the consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain trade receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the likelihood of failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates 

inventories 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 we changed the method of valuing our inventories that used the lifo method to the fifo method so that all of our inventories are now determined using the fifo method we state inventories at the lower of cost or market costs related to inventories include raw materials direct labor and manufacturing overhead which are included in cost of sales on the consolidated statement of operations 

property and equipment net 

we state property and equipment at cost except for the fair value of acquired property and equipment and property and equipment that have been impaired for which we reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value at the impairment date we capitalize significant improvements and charge repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to expense as incurred we remove the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the accounts and recognize any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition of the assets 

we depreciate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis as follows buildings — 20 to 40 years machinery and equipment — 5 to 10 years and other property and equipment — 2 to 10 years 

goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the following 1 consideration transferred 2 the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and 3 if the business combination is achieved in stages the acquisitiondate fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisitiondate amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 

identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of patents licenses trademarks trade names customer lists and relationships noncompete agreements and technology based intangibles and other contractual agreements we amortize finite lived identifiable intangible assets over the shorter of their stated or statutory duration or their estimated useful lives generally ranging from 3 to 15 years on a straightline basis to their estimated residual values and periodically review them for impairment total identifiable intangible assets comprise 11 in both 2015 and 2014 of our consolidated total assets 

we use the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations and do not amortize goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

longlived assets 

impairment and disposal of longlived assets 

for definitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinitelived intangible assets such as inprocess research and development and trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review other than for inprocess research and development assets we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinitelived is appropriate see note 7 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for additional details 

selfinsurance 

we retain the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property casualty workers’ compensation and employee benefit claims we accrue for outstanding reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not reported based upon management’s estimates of the aggregate liability for retained losses using historical experience insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values our estimates include management’s and independent insurance companies’ assumptions regarding economic conditions the frequency and severity of claims and claim development patterns and settlement practices these estimates and assumptions are monitored and evaluated on a periodic basis by management and are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 

pensions 

for a number of our us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

we review and approve the assumptions made by our thirdparty actuaries regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations the expected future rate of return on plan assets the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions the measurement date used to determine benefit obligations is december 31 for all material plans november 30 for nonmaterial plans the measurement date used to determine plan assets is december 31 for all plans in general significant changes to these assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recorded in our consolidated financial statements 

see note 14 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for information about the company’s benefit plans 

net earnings per common share 

basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period nonvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and therefore included in computing earnings per common share using the “twoclass method” the twoclass method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net earnings per common share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings the nonvested restricted stock issued under our omnibus plan and our 2005 contingent stock plan are considered participating securities since these securities have nonforfeitable rights to dividends when we declare a dividend during the contractual vesting period of the sharebased payment award and therefore included in our earnings allocation formula using the twoclass method 

when calculating diluted net earnings per common share the more dilutive effect of applying either of the following is presented a the twoclass method described above assuming that the participating security is not exercised or converted or b the treasury stock method for the participating security our diluted net earnings per common share for all periods presented were calculated using the twoclass method since such method was more dilutive 

see note 21 “net earnings per common share” for further discussion 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in november 2015 financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards updates “asu” 201517 income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes “asu 201517” this asu will simplify the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities by requiring companies to classify all deferred tax as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts asu 201517 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 31 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods however as early adoption is available we have adopted this standard as of december 31 2015 with retroactive application adoption of asu 201517 resulted in a decrease in current deferred tax assets of 1056 million an increase in noncurrent deferred tax assets of 170 million a decrease in current deferred tax liabilities of 48 million and a decrease in noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 838 million as of december 31 2014

acquisitions 

acquisition of intellibot robotics llc 

during the first quarter of 2015 we acquired the business of intellibot robotics llc a usbased privately owned company that has pioneered the development of robotic commercial floor cleaning machines the combination of diversey care’s industry expertise and global reach and intellibot’s artificial intelligence technology will help accelerate the development of the robotic floor cleaning machines market – ultimately driving efficiencies and business value for the hygiene industry

the fair value of the consideration transferred was 18 million which included cash paid of 9 million and 9 million related to the fair value of contingent consideration we recorded the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date which included 11 million of intangible assets based on the preliminary allocation goodwill of 7 million was recorded and 100 will be deductible for tax purposes  

 

the contingent consideration which is classified as a liability includes earnout fees to be paid out in cash to the seller over a 10 year period based on various percentages of net sales over the 10 year period since it is classified as a liability we must remeasure to fair value each reporting period the fair value of the liability as of december 31 2015 was 10 million mostly included in noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet the less than 1 million change in fair value was recognized in selling general and administrative expenses the valuation of the contingent consideration is based on a probability weighted projection of payments over the 10 year period using the deterministic method these projections are based on our internal forecast of the business performance and since this is an unobservable input used in the fair value measurement it would be considered a level 3 input as defined in note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” in addition the probability weighted earnout payments were present valued using factors to consider the risk associated with achievement of the sales forecast and the credit risk associated with the payments

acquisition of b equipment

during the third quarter of 2015 we acquired 100 equity interest in the business of b equipment a company headquartered in france that designs manufactures and services automated packaging equipment for order fulfillment operations our acquisition strategy is focused on bestinclass disruptive technologies that extends product care’s leadership position the acquisition of b further solidifies our position in the growing ecommerce market with a solution that focuses on reducing the cost of shipping and increasing productivity

other

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we acquired a small business in the food care division the purchase price allocation had not been completed as of december 31 2015 as such 7 million of the purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill 

note 4 segments 

the company’s segment reporting structure consists of three reportable segments and an “other” category and is as follows 









the company’s food care diversey care and product care segments are considered reportable segments under fasb asc topic 280 our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products other includes corporate and the medical applications and new ventures businesses other includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable segments as applicable primarily consisting of unallocated corporate overhead costs including administrative functions and cost recovery variances not allocated to the reportable segments from global functional expenses 

we allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments although property and equipment net is not allocated to the segment assets nor is depreciation and amortization included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda we also disclose restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment although these items are not included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda since restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are categorized as special items as outlined in the table reconciling nonus gaap total company adjusted ebitda to us gaap net earnings from continuing operations set forth below the accounting policies of the reportable segments and other are the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements 

the following tables show net sales and adjusted ebitda by our segment reporting structure 

 



 

the following table shows a reconciliation of nonus gaap total company adjusted ebitda to us gaap net earnings from continuing operations 

 



 





 



 







 



 

the restructuring and other charges in 2015 primarily relate to our previously announced fusion program the restructuring and other charges in 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to our previously announced earnings quality improve ment program eqip see note 9 “restructuring and relocation activities” for further discussion 

assets by reportable segments 

the following table shows assets allocated by our segment reporting structure only assets which are identifiable by segment and reviewed by our chief operating decision maker by segment are allocated to the reportable segment assets which are trade receivables net and finished goods inventories net all other assets are included in “assets not allocated” 

 



 

allocation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to reportable segments 

our management views goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as corporate assets so we do not allocate their balances to the reportable segments however we are required to allocate their balances to each reporting unit to perform our annual impairment review which we do during the fourth quarter of the year using a measurement date of october 1 st  see note 7 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for the allocation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and the changes in their balances in the year ended december 31 2015 by our segment reporting structure and the details of our impairment review

note 7 goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually during the fourth quarter of each year using a measurement date of october 1 st  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our 2015 and 2014 annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of each applicable year we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units 

the goodwill impairment test involves a twostep process in step one we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must perform step two of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

2015 2014 and 2013 annual impairment test 

during the fourth quarters of 2015 2014 and 2013 we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment test for our reporting units we concluded that the fair values of these reporting units were above their carrying values and therefore there was no indication of impairment in either year 

we estimated the fair value of these reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from an income and market approaches under the income approach we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins taking into consideration industry and market conditions the discount rate used is based on a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with the characteristics of the business and the projected cash flows the market approaches estimate fair value based on market multiples of current and forward 12month operating performance results as applicable derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit

 

allocation of goodwill to reporting units 

the following table shows our goodwill balances by our segment reporting structure 

 



 







 

the excess of estimated fair values over carrying value including goodwill for each of our reporting units that had goodwill as of the 2015 annual impairment test were the following 

 



 





 

 

as noted above the fair value determined under step one of the goodwill impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 exceeded the carrying value for each reporting unit therefore there was no impairment of goodwill however if the fair value decreases in future periods the company may fail step one of the goodwill impairment test and be required to perform step two in performing step two the fair value would have to be allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit therefore any potential goodwill impairment charge would be dependent upon the estimated fair value of the reporting unit at that time and the outcome of step two of the impairment test the fair values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including the intangible assets could vary depending on various factors 

the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment such as a decrease in expected net earnings adverse equity market conditions a decline in current market multiples a decline in our common stock price a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of could require an interim assessment for some or all of the reporting units before the next required annual assessment in the event of significant adverse changes of the nature described above we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

i dentifiable intangible assets 

the following tables summarize our identifiable intangible assets with definite and indefinite useful lives 

 



 







the following table shows the remaining estimated future amortization expense at december 31 2015 

 



 

amortization expense was 887 million in 2015 1189 million in 2014 and 1232 million in 2013

we and a group of our us operating subsidiaries maintain an accounts receivable securitization program under which they sell eligible us accounts receivable to an indirectly whollyowned subsidiary that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into this program the whollyowned subsidiary in turn may sell an undivided fractional ownership interest in these receivables with two banks and issuers of commercial paper administered by these banks the whollyowned subsidiary retains the receivables it purchases from the operating subsidiaries any transfers of fractional ownership interests of receivables under the us receivables securitization program to the two banks and issuers of commercial paper administered by these banks are considered secured borrowings with pledge of collateral and will be classified as shortterm borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets these banks do not have any recourse against the general credit of the company the net trade receivables that served as collateral for these borrowings are reclassified from trade receivables net to prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets

as of december 31 2015 the maximum purchase limit for receivable interests was 90 million subject to the availability limits described below

the amounts available from time to time under this program may be less than 90 million due to a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings trade receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience during the year ended december 31 2015 the level of eligible assets available under the program was lower than 90 million primarily due to certain required reserves against our receivables as a result the amount available to us under the program before utilization was 72 million at december 31 2015 although we do not believe restrictions under this program presently materially restrict our operations if an additional event occurs that triggers one of these restrictive provisions we could experience a further decline in the amounts available to us under the program or termination of the program

the program expires annually in september and is renewable the program expires annually and is renewable the expiration date of the program was extended for a one month period until september 30 2015 and then renewed for an additional year at the end of such extension

european accounts receivables securitization program 

we and a group of our european subsidiaries maintain an accounts receivable securitization program with a special purpose vehicle or spv two banks and issuers of commercial paper administered by these banks the european program is structured to be a securitization of certain trade receivables that are originated by certain of our european subsidiaries the spv borrows funds from the banks to fund its acquisition of the receivables and provides the banks with a first priority perfected security interest in the accounts receivable we do not have an equity interest in the spv we concluded the spv is a variable interest entity because its total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the spv to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from the bank via loans or via the collections from accounts receivable already purchased additionally we are considered the primary beneficiary of the spv since we control the activities of the spv and are exposed to the risk of uncollectable receivables held by the spv therefore the spv is consolidated in our consolidated financial statements any activity between the participating subsidiaries and the spv is eliminated in consolidation loans from the banks to the spv will be classified as shortterm borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets the net trade receivables that served as collateral for these borrowings are reclassified from trade receivables net to prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

as of december 31 2015 the maximum purchase limit for receivable interests was €110 million 120 million equivalent at december 31 2015 subject to availability limits the terms and provisions of this program are similar to our us program discussed above as of december 31 2015 the amount available under this program before utilization was €110 million 120 million equivalent as of december 31 2015 

this program expires annually in february and is renewable the program was renewed in february 2016 for an additional year 

utilization of our accounts receivable securitization programs

as of december 31 2015 there were borrowings of 67 million outstanding under our us program and borrowings of €70 million 77 million equivalent as of december 31 2015 under our european program  we continue to service the trade receivables supporting the programs and the banks are permitted to repledge this collateral total interest expense related to the use of these programs was less than 1 million for the year ended december 31 2015 

under limited circumstances the banks and the issuers of commercial paper can end purchases of receivables interests before the above expiration dates a failure to comply with debt leverage or various other ratios related to our receivables collection experience could result in termination of the receivables programs we were in compliance with th ese ratios at december 31 2015 

as of december 31 2014 the total amount of borrowings under our us program was 36 million and there were no amounts outstanding under the european program

note 12 derivatives and hedging activities 

we report all derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and establish criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes 

as a large global organization we face exposure to market risks such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates to manage the volatility relating to these exposures we enter into various derivative instruments from time to time under our risk management policies we designate derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge accounting the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged we assess the initial and ongoing effectiveness of our hedging relationships in accordance with our policy we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated or if we determine the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring 

we record the fair value positions of all derivative financial instruments on a net basis by counterparty for which a master netting arrangement is utilized

foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges 

the primary purpose of our cash flow hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value associated with the amounts receivable or payable on equipment and raw material purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to minimize the impact of the changes in foreign currencies we record gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income to the extent that these hedges are effective and until we recognize the underlying transactions in net earnings at which time we recognize these gains and losses in other expense net on our consolidated statements of operations cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows these contracts generally have original maturities of less than 12 months 

net unrealized aftertax gains losses related to these contracts that were included in other comprehensive income were 59 million 38 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 the unrealized amounts in other comprehensive income will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts during each reporting period 

we estimate that 59 million of net unrealized derivative gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months 

foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges 

our subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure from buying and selling in currencies other than their functional currencies the primary purposes of our foreign currency hedging activities are to manage the potential changes in value associated with the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to minimize the impact of the changes in foreign currencies related to foreign currencydenominated interestbearing intercompany loans and receivables and payables the changes in fair value of these derivative contracts are recognized in other income net on our consolidated statements of operations and are largely offset by the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currencydenominated items indicated above cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows these contracts generally have original maturities of less than 12 months 

interest rate swaps 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps to manage our mix of fixed and floating interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness 

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we terminated the swaps that we entered into in 2013 the swaps were associated with the 65 senior notes although the 65 senior notes remained outstanding the termination resulted in a 3 million gain which is being amortized over the remaining life of the 65 senior note and included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 

as a result of our interest rate swap agreements interest expense was reduced by 2 million in 2014 and less than 1 million in 2013

at december 31 2015 and 2014 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps

interest rate and currency swaps 

in 2014 in connection with exercising the 100 million delayed draw under the senior secured credit facility we entered into a series of interest rate and currency swaps in a notional amount of 100 million these swaps convert the us dollar denominated variable rate obligation under the credit facility into a fixed brazilian realdenominated obligation the delayed draw and the interest rate and currency swaps are used to fund expansion and general corporate purposes of our brazilian subsidiaries

net investment hedge

during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange forwards totaling €270 million these foreign currency exchange forwards hedged a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and expired in june 2015 the loss of 35 million 22 million after tax is recorded in aoci on our consolidated balance sheet 

the €400 million 450 notes issued in june 2015 are designated as a net investment hedge hedging a portion of our net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the change in the fair value of the debt was 124 million 76 million after tax at december 31 2015 and is reflected in longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheet 

in march 2015 we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps with a combined notional amount of 425 million hedging a portion of the net investment in a certain european subsidiary against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the fair value of this hedge as of december 31 2015 was 120 million 74 million after tax on our consolidated balance sheet semiannual interest settlements resulted in aoci of 59 million 36 million after tax 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations settlements and changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in unrealized net gains or loss on derivative instruments for net investment hedge a component of aoci net of taxes to offset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged any portion of the net investment hedge that is determined to be ineffective is recorded in other income net on the consolidated statements of operations

other derivative instruments

during the second quarter of 2015 we entered into a series of foreign currency exchange options to partially protect our eurodenominated earnings from a decline in the value of the euro the options expired during 2015 

we may enter into other derivative instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates and to gain access to international financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency

fair value of derivative instruments 

see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for a discussion of the inputs and valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments 

the following table details the fair value of our derivative instruments included on our consolidated balance sheets 

 



 







 



 

the following table details the effect of our derivative instruments on our consolidated statements of operations 

 



 









 

 

note 13 fair value measurements and other financial instruments 

fair value measurements 

the fair value of our financial instruments using the fair value hierarchy under us gaap detailed in “fair value measurements” of note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” are included in the table below 

 



 



 







cash equivalents 

our cash equivalents at december 31 2015 and 2014 consisted of commercial paper fair value determined using level 2 inputs and bank time deposits level 1 since these are shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase they present negligible risk of changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates 

compensating balance deposits

we have compensating balance deposits related to certain shortterm borrowings these represent bank certificates of deposits with maturities of greater than 3 months 

derivative financial instruments 

our foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency options eurodenominated debt interest rate and currency swaps and crosscurrency swaps are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets using a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable market inputs these market inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates and various interest rate curves and are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks third party sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments level 2

counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are rated at least bbb by standard  poor’s and a3 by moody’s credit ratings on some of our counterparties may change during the term of our financial instruments we closely monitor our counterparties’ credit ratings and if necessary will make any appropriate changes to our financial instruments th e fair value generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date 

other financial instruments 

the following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value 1 trade receivables net 2 certain other current assets 3 accounts payable and 4 other current liabilities the carrying amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheets for the above financial instruments closely approximate their fair value due to the shortterm nature of these assets and liabilities 

other liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets include our senior notes we utilize a market approach to calculate the fair value of our senior notes due to their limited investor base and the face value of some of our senior notes they may not be actively traded on the date we calculate their fair value therefore we may utilize prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar securities reflecting us treasury yields to calculate the yield to maturity and the price on some of our senior notes these inputs are provided by an independent third party and are considered to be level 2 inputs 

we derive our fair value estimates of our various other debt instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument considering prevailing economic and market conditions and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date we also incorporated our credit default swap rates and currency specific swap rates in the valuation of each debt instrument as applicable 

these estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore we cannot determine them with precision changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates 

the table below shows the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our total debt 

 



 





as of december 31 2015 we did not have any non–financial assets and liabilities aside from contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions and certain equity compensation that were carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated financial statements or for which a fair value measurement was required included among our nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis are inventories net property and equipment goodwill intangible assets and asset retirement obligations refer to note 3 “divestitures and acquisitions” for information regarding contingent consideration and note 18 “stockholders’ equity” for share based compensation

credit and market risk 

financial instruments including derivatives expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards establishing credit limits diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 

we do not expect any of our counterparties in derivativ e transactions to fail to perform as it is our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least bbb or higher by standard  poor’s and baa3 or higher by moody’s nevertheless there is a risk that our exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations we will replace counterparties if a credit downgrade is deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels 

we regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments 

we continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally do not require collateral we consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to significant risks of nearterm severe adverse impacts the terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers 

 

 

note 14 profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans 

profit sharing and retirement savings plans 

we have a qualified noncontributory profit sharing plan covering most of our us employees contributions to this plan which are made at the discretion of our board of directors may be made in cash shares of our common stock or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock we also maintain qualified contributory retirement savings plans in which most of our us employees are eligible to participate the qualified contributory retirement savings plans generally provide for our contributions in cash based upon the amount contributed to the plans by the participants 

our contributions to our provisions for the profit sharing plan and retirement savings plans are charged to operations and amounted to 55 million in 2015 50 million in 2014 and 51 million in 2013 in 2015 08 million shares were contributed as part of our contribution to the profit sharing plan related to 2014 in 2014 10 million shares were contributed as part of our contribution to the profit sharing plan related to 2013 and in 2013 09 million shares were contributed as part of our contribution to the profit sharing plan related to 2012 these shares were issued out of treasury stock 

we have various international defined contribution benefit plans which cover certain employees we have expanded use of these plans in select countries where they have been used to supplement or replace defined benefit plans 

defined benefit pension plans 

we recognize the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of the employee benefit plans in the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulate other comprehensive loss net of taxes each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet subsequent changes in the funded status are recorded in unrecognized pension items a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss that is included in total stockholders’ equity the amount of unamortized pension items is recorded net of tax the measurement date used to determine the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets is december 31 

we have amortized actuarial gains or losses over the average future working lifetime or remaining lifetime of inactive participants if there are no active participants we have used the corridor method where the corridor is the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or fair value of assets at year end if actuarial gains or losses do not exceed the corridor then there is no amortization of gain or loss 

the following table shows the components of our net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended de cember 31 for our pension plans charged to operations 

 



 

the amount recorded in inventory for the year ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 was not material 

a number of our us employees including some employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements participate in defined benefit pension plans some of our international employees participate in defined benefit pension plans in their respective countries the following table presents our funded status for 2015 and 2014 for our us and international pension plans the measurement date used to determine benefit obligations is december 31 for all material plans november 30 for nonmaterial plans the measurement date used to determine plan assets is december 31 for all plans

actuarial assumptions 

weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december 31 2015 and 2014 were as follows 

 



 

weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the three years ended december 31 were as follows 

 



 

effective december 31 2015 the company changed the approach used to calculate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for certain of its international and us benefit plans to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs the change was applied to plans in countries where the benefit obligation was approximately 50 million or higher and for which a yield curve is used to measure the benefit obligation historically the company calculated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period going forward the company has elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve over the projected cash flow period based on current economic conditions the company estimates that the service cost and interest cost for these benefit plans will be reduced by approximately 4 million in 2016 the company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly has accounted for it prospectively

in 2015 we adopted the society of actuaries retirement plan 2015 rp2015 table with mortality projection 2015 mp2015 improvement scale for all of our us plans 

estimated future benefit payments 

we expect the following estimated future benefit payments which reflect expected future service as appropriate to be paid in the years indicated 

 



 

plan assets 

we review the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets annually taking into consideration our asset allocation historical returns and the current economic environment the expected return on plan assets is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets at year end to determine the expected return on plan assets expected cash flows have been taken into account 

our longterm objectives for plan investments are to ensure that a there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit obligations to participants over the life of the plans b there is sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover current benefit obligations and c there is a high level of investment return consistent with a prudent level of investment risk the investment strategy is focused on a longterm total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with shortterm volatility less than that of a pure equity strategy to accomplish this objective we invest assets primarily in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income investments for us plans the target asset allocation will typically be 4050 in equity securities with a maximum equity allocation of 70 and 5060 in fixed income securities with a minimum fixed income allocation of 30 including cash 

the fair values of our us and international pension plan assets by asset category and by the level of fair values are as follows

note 15 other postemployment benefits and other employee benefit plans 

in addition to providing pension benefits we provide for a portion of healthcare dental vision and life insurance benefits for certain retired legacy diversey employees primarily in north america covered employees retiring on or after attaining age 55 and who have rendered at least ten years of service are entitled to postretirement healthcare dental and life insurance benefits these benefits are subject to deductibles copayment provisions and other limitations

note 16 income taxes 

the components of earnings loss from continuing operations before income tax provision were as follows 

 



 

the components of our income tax provision benefit were as follows

 



 

the company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards the excess tax benefit recorded as an increase to additional paidin capital was 13 million in 2015 and less than 1 million in 2014 and 2013

deferred tax assets liabilities consist of the following 

 



 

the increase in net deferred tax assets is primarily attributable to the decrease in the liability on unremitted earnings and the recognition of foreign tax credits partially offset by a decrease in the net operating loss asset 

the unremitted foreign earnings liability decreased due to the company’s ability to recognize the benefits of foreign tax credits associated with repatriated earnings 

the net operating loss carryforwards decreased as a result of the domestic prior year taxable income adjustment from the ofl recapture offset in part by an increase in foreign net operating losses 

the company’s foreign tax credits increased as a result of the ability to utilize favorable tax attributes which allows for realization of foreign tax credits 

we have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize the majority of deferred tax assets at december 31 2015 in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future reversals of existing temporary diff erences future taxable earnings taxable income in carryback periods and tax planning strategies to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earn ings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets 

a valuation allowance has been provided based on the uncertainty of utilizing the tax benefits related to the following deferred tax assets 











for the year ended december 31 2015 the valuation allowance increased by 30 million the increase is primarily related to recording additional valuation allowance on certain foreign and state net operating losses partially offset by a decrease of 58 million primarily based on the expectation that the company will realize the majority of its foreign tax credits the ability to realize additional foreign tax credits is attributable to the existence of a tax attribute generated in prior years which allows for foreign tax credit utilization and a decrease in the 2014 net operating loss related to provision to return adjustments included in the 58 million valuation allowance decrease is 29 million of foreign tax credits recognized as a result of the reserve on a portion of the settlement agreement payment a valuation allowance for state net operating losses included approximately 5 million that upon reversal would be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital

as of december 31 2015 we have foreign net operating loss carry forwards of 800 million expiring in years beginning in 2016 with the majority of losses having an unlimited carryover the state net operating loss carryforwards totaling 15 billion expire in various amounts over one to 20 years 

as of december 31 2015 we have foreign and federal foreign tax credit carry forwards and investment allowances totaling 199 million that expire in calendar year 2016 through 2035 67 million of foreign tax credits will expire in 2016 if not utilized we have provided a valuation allowance for the portion of credits expected to expire unutilized we have 22 million of state credit carryovers expiring in 2016 – 2035 we have provided a full valuation allowance on the state credits

the company has provided a 44 million deferred tax liability for unremitted foreign earnings which is net of foreign tax credits of approximately 124 million the liability relates to approximately 15 billion of our foreign subsidiaries’ accumulated earnings that the company plans to repatriate 

the company has not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately 51 billion of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely reinvested upon repatriation of those earnings the company could be subject to both us income taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation however unrecognized foreign tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of the us tax liability

we recorded an excess tax benefit of 46 million as an out of period adjustment in december 2015 and 38 million in december 2014 related to shares of common stock issued in the settlement agreement 

a reconciliation of the provision for income taxes with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate 35 to income before provisio n for income taxes is as follows dollars in millions 

 



 

the primary adjustments to the statutory rate in 2015 were the following items











tax expense for 2015 includes an 11 million benefit from adjustments that would appropriately be recorded in a prior period but which management has determined are not material to the financial statements and therefore included in current year these items include income from ofl recapture benefit from recognition of foreign tax credits deferred tax adjustments and additional domestic taxable income from foreign sources 

unrecognized tax benefits

we are providing the following disclosures related to our unrecognized tax benefits and the effect on our effective income tax rate if recognized in millions

 



 

in 2015 we increased our unrecognized tax benefit by 50 million primarily related to the recording of a reserve related to the settlement payment which was partially offset by the release of 58 million of tax reserves for which the statute of limitations has expired and were primarily recorded at the time of the diversey holdings inc acquisition the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits in 2014 was primarily due to a release of reserves in connection with funding the settlement agreement an amnesty program available in a foreign jurisdiction and approximately 6 million of payments made in connection with that program   

if the unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015 were recogniz ed our income tax provision would decrease by 204 million resulting in a substantially lower effective tax rate based on the potential outcome of the company’s global tax examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific juri sdictions it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next 12 months the associated impact on the reserve balance is estimated to be a decrease in the range of 0 to 48 million 

we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations we had a liability of approximately of29 million of which 10 million represents penalties at december 31 2015 for the payment of interest and penalties before any tax benefit a liability of 29 million of which 11 million represents penalties at december 31 2014 and a liability of approximately 27 million of which 12 million represents penalties at december 31 2013 in 2015 there was a negligible change in interest and penalties in the tax accruals for uncertainties in prior years in 2014 and 2013 interest and penalties of 4 million and 5 million respectively were reversed in connection with the related tax accruals for uncertainties in prior years 

income tax returns 

the internal revenue service the “service” has concluded its examination of the legacy sealed air us federal income tax returns for all years through 2008 except 2007 remains open to the extent of a capital loss carryback the service is currently auditing the 2007 and 2010 consolidated us federal income tax returns of legacy sealed air we are also under examination by the irs with respect to the settlement agreement deduction in 2014 the outcome of the negotiations may affect the utilization of certain tax attributes and require us to return a portion of the refund

state income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after their filing date we have various state income tax returns in the process of examination and are open to examination for periods after 2002

our foreign income tax returns are under examination in various jurisdictions in which we conduct business income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to five years after their filing date and except where still under examination or where we are litigating we have generally concluded all other income tax matters globally for years through 2007 

management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in the company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs

settlement agreement and related costs

as discussed below on february 3 2014 the “effective date” the pi settlement plan as defined below implementing the settlement agreement as defined below became effective with w r grace  co or grace emerging from bankruptcy and the injunctions and releases provided by the pi settlement plan becoming effective the settlement agreement provided for resolution of current and future asbestosrelated claims fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims made against the company and our affiliates in connection with the cryovac transaction described below as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction on the effective date the company’s subsidiary cryovac inc made the payments contemplated by the settlement agreement consisting of aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and the transfer of 18 million shares of sealed air common stock the “settlement shares” to the pi trust in each case reflecting adjustments made in accordance with the settlement agreement to fund the cash payment we used 555 million of cash and cash equivalents and utilized borrowings of 260 million from our revolving credit facility and 115 million from our accounts receivable securitization programs in connection with the issuance of the settlement shares and their transfer to the pi trust by cryovac the company entered into a registration rights agreement dated as of february 3 2014 the “registration rights agreement” with the pi trust as initial holder of the settlement shares in accordance with the registration rights agreement the company filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering resales of the settlement shares on april 4 2014 and the shelf registration statement became effective on such date on june 13 2014 we repurchased 130 million or 3932244 shares of common stock at a price of 3306 per share from the pi trust see note 18 ‘stockholders’ equity” for further details

we are currently under examination by the irs with respect to the deduction of the approxi mately 149 billion for the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement the irs has indicated that it intends to disallow this deduction in full we strongly disagree with the irs position and at such time as the irs finishes its examination of this item intend to file a protest of this finding with the office of appeals of the irs the resolution of the irss challenge could take several years and the outcome cannot be predicted nevertheless we believe that we have meritorious defenses for the deduction of the payments made pursuant to the settlement agreement if the irss disallowance of the deduction were sustained in whole or in part we would have to remit all or a portion of the refund of taxes previously received and such disallowa nce could adversely affect the utilization of certain of our tax attributes 

for a description of the cryovac transaction asbestosrelated claims and the parties involved see “cryovac transaction” “discussion of cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” “fresenius claims” “canadian claims” and “additional matters related to the cryovac transaction” below

cryovac transaction

on june 30 1998 we completed a multistep transaction that brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air corporation’s business under the common ownership of the company these businesses operated as subsidiaries of the company and the company acted as a holding company as part of that transaction the parties separated the cryovac packaging business which previously had been held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company from the remaining businesses previously held by the company the parties then arranged for the contribution of these remaining businesses to a company now known as w r grace  co and the company distributed the grace shares to the company’s stockholders as a result w r grace  co became a separate publicly owned company the company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock a subsidiary of the company then merged into the former sealed air corporation which became a subsidiary of the company and changed its name to sealed air corporation us

discussion of cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies

in connection with the cryovac transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction whether accruing or occurring before or after the cryovac transaction other than liabilities arising from or relating to cryovac’s operations among the liabilities retained by grace are liabilities relating to asbestoscontaining products previously manufactured or sold by grace’s subsidiaries prior to the cryovac transaction including its primary us operating subsidiary w r grace  co — conn which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of grace since the cryovac transaction the cryovac transaction agreements provided that should any claimant seek to hold the company or any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities retained by grace or its subsidiaries including the asbestosrelated liabilities grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify and defend us

since the beginning of 2000 we have been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction we were responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries some of which were also named as codefendants in some of these actions among these lawsuits were several purported class actions and a number of personal injury lawsuits some plaintiffs sought damages for personal injury or wrongful death while others sought medical monitoring environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product neither the former sealed air corporation nor cryovac inc ever produced or sold any of the asbestoscontaining materials that were the subjects of these cases while the allegations in these actions directed to us varied these actions all appeared to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business as part of the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability in the joint proxy statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the cryovac transaction both parties to the transaction stated their belief that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the cryovac transaction would be fraudulent transfers and the parties’ belief that the cryovac transaction complied with other relevant laws however if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached conclusions adverse to us these determinations could have had a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and we could have been required to return the property or its value to the transferor or to fund liabilities of grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors including asbestos claimants none of these cases reached resolution through judgment settlement or otherwise we signed the settlement agreement described below that provided for the resolution of these claims moreover as discussed below grace’s chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding stayed all of these cases and the orders confirming grace’s plan of reorganization enjoined parties from prosecuting gracerelated asbestos claims against the company we signed the settlement agreement described below that provided for the resolution of these claims

on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidi aries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court in the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 filing and at grace’s request the court issued a n order dated may 3 2001 which was modified on january 22 2002 under which the court stayed all the filed or pending asbestos actions against us and upon filing and service on us all future asbestos actions collectively the “preliminary injunction”  pursuant to the preliminary injunction no further proceedings involving us could occur in the actions that were stayed except upon further order of the bankruptcy court committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s bankruptcy case received the court’s permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc and against fresenius this proceeding was brought in the us district court for the district of delaware the “district c ourt” adv no 0202210 the claims against fresenius were based upon a 1996 transaction between fresenius and w r grace  co — conn fresenius is not affiliated with us in june 2002 the court permitted the us government to intervene as a plainti ff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding so that the us government could pursue allegations that environmental remediation expenses were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of grace conducted at the time of the cryovac transaction 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees prosecuting the claims against the company and cryovac inc to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims arising from the cryovac transaction as memorialized by the parties and approved by the bankruptcy court the “settlement agreement” the parties subsequently signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle and the settlement agreement was approved by order of the bankruptcy court dated june 27 2005 the settlement agreement called for payment of nine million shares of our common stock and 513 million in cash plus interest on the cash payment at a 55 annual rate starting on december 21 2002 and ending on the effective date of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the grace bankruptcy when we would be required to make the payment these shares were subject to customary antidilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits stock dividends and other events affecting our common stock and as a result the number of shares of our common stock issued under the settlement agreement increased to eighteen million shares upon the twoforone stock split in march 2007 the settlement agreement provided that upon the effective date of the final plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash all present and future asbestosrelated claims against us that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its affiliates including former affiliates that became our affiliates through the cryovac transaction would be channeled to and become the responsibility of one or more trusts established under section 524g of the bankruptcy code the settlement agreement also provided for resolution of all fraudulent transfer claims against us arising from the cryovac transaction as well as the fresenius claims described below the settlement agreement provided for releases of all those claims upon payment under the settlement agreement we cannot seek indemnity from grace for our payments required by the settlement agreement the order approving the settlement agreement also provided that the preliminary injunction stay of proceedings involving us described above continued through the effective date of the final plan of reorganization after which upon implementation of the settlement agreement we have been released from the grace asbestos liabilities asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against us are enjoined as more fully discussed below the settlement agreement became effective upon grace’s emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to the pi settlement plan following the effective date the bankruptcy court issued an order dismissing the proceedings pursuant to which the preliminary injunction was issued

on september 19 2008 grace the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the asbestos pi future claimants’ representative and the official committee of equity security holders filed a s coproponents a plan of reorganization that incorporated a settlement of all present and future asbestosrelated personal injury claims against grace as filed and amended from time to time the “pi settlement plan” amended versions of the pi settleme nt plan and related exhibits and documents were filed with the bankruptcy court from time to time the pi settlement plan provides for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the united states bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the pi settlement plan also incorporates the settlement agreement including our payment of the amounts contemplated by the settlement agreement the bankruptcy court entered a memorandum opinion overruling certain objections to the pi settlement plan on january 31 2011 and entered orders on january 31 2011 and february 15 2011 collectively with the opinion the “bankruptcy court confirmation orders” confirming the pi se ttlement plan and requesting that the district court issue and affirm the bankruptcy court confirmation order including the injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code various parties appealed or otherwise challenged the bankruptcy court conf irmation orders on january 30 2012 and june 11 2012  the district court issued memorandum opinions and orders collectively with the bankruptcy court confirmation orders the “confirmation orders” overruling all objections to the pi settlement plan an d confirming the pi settlement plan in its entirety including the approval and issuance of the injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code and the other injunctions releases and indemnifications set forth in the pi settlement plan and the ba nkruptcy court confirmation order five appeals to the confirmation orders were filed with the united states court of appeals for the third circuit the “third circuit court of appeals” the third circuit court of appeals dismissed or denied the appeals in separate opinions with the final dismissal occurring on the effective date on january 29 2014 by agreement of the parties the bankruptcy court dismissed with prejudice the fraudulent transfer action brought against the company by the committees app ointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s bankruptcy also on the effective date the remaining conditions to the effectiveness of the pi settlement plan and the settlement agreement were satisfied or waived by the relevant parties including the company and the pi settlement plan implementing the settlement agreement became effective and grace emerged from bankruptcy on the effective date in addition under the pi settlement plan the confirmation orders and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the pi settlement plan and the settlement ag reement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify the company and its subsidiaries for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effe ct on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

fresenius claims

in january 2002 we filed a declaratory judgment action against fresenius medical care holdings inc its parent fresenius ag a german company and specified affiliates in new york state court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties the fresenius parties contended that we were obligated to indemnify them for liabilities that they might incur as a result of the 1996 fresenius transaction mentioned above the fresenius parties’ contention was based on their interpretation of the agreements between them and w r grace  co — conn in connection with the 1996 fresenius transaction in february 2002 the fresenius parties announced that they had accrued a charge of 172 million for these potential liabilities which included pretransaction tax liabilities of grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from grace’s chapter 11 filing we believe that we were not responsible to indemnify the fresenius parties under the 1996 agreements and filed the action to proceed to a resolution of the fresenius parties’ claims in april 2002 the fresenius parties filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor we opposed the motion and in july 2003 the court denied the motion without prejudice in view of the november 27 2002 agreement in principle referred to above on the effective date and in connection with the pi settlement plan and the settlement agreement we and the fresenius parties exchanged mutual releases releasing us from any and all claims related to the 1996 fresenius transaction

canadian claims

in april 2001 grace canada inc had obtained an order of the superior court of justice commercial list toronto the “canadian court” recognizing the chapter 11 actions in the united states of america involving grace canada inc’s us parent corporation and other affiliates of grace canada inc and enjoining all new actions and staying all current proceedings against grace canada inc related to asbestos under the companies’ creditors arrangement act that order has been renewed repeatedly in november 2005 upon motion by grace canada inc the canadian court ordered an extension of the injunction and stay to actions involving asbestos against the company and its canadian affiliate and the attorney general of canada which had the effect of staying all of the canadian actions referred to above the parties finalized a global settlement of these canadian actions except for claims against the canadian government that settlement which has subsequently been amended the “canadian settlement” will be entirely funded by grace the canadian court issued an order on december 13 2009 approving the canadian settlement we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us became operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in grace’s united states chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the pi settlement plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code as indicated above the bankruptcy court entered the bankruptcy court confirmation order on january 31 2011 and the clarifying order on february 15 2011 and the district court entered the original district court confirmation order on january 30 2012 and the amended district court confirmation order on june 11 2012 the canadian court issued an order on april 8 2011 recognizing and giving full effect to the bankruptcy court’s confirmation order in all provinces and territories of canada in accordance with the bankruptcy court confirmation order’s terms

as described above the pi settlement plan became effective on february 3 2014 in accordance with the abovementioned december 31 2009 order of the canadian court on the effective date the actions became permanently stayed until they are amended to remove the grace parties as named defendants the abovementioned actions in the manitoba court of queen’s bench were dismissed by the manitoba court as against the grace parties on february 19 2014 the remaining actions were either dismissed or discontinued with prejudice by the canadian courts as against the grace parties in may and june 2015 but for two actions in the province of quebec for which motions to dismiss are pending although we believe the possibility to be remote if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify the company and its subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay substantial damages which we cannot estimate at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

additional matters related to the cryovac transaction

in view of grace’s chapter 11 filing we may receive additional claims asserting that we are liable for obligations that grace had agreed to retain in the cryovac transaction and for which we may be contingently liable to date we are not aware of any material claims having been asserted or threatened against us

final determinations and accountings under the cryovac transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the transaction had not been completed at the time of grace’s chapter 11 filing in 2001 we filed claims in the bankruptcy proceeding that reflect the costs and liabilities that we have incurred or may incur and that grace and its affiliates agreed to retain or that are subject to indemnification by grace and its affiliates under the cryovac t ransaction agreements other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement grace has alleged that we are responsible for specified amounts under the cryovac transaction agreements on february 3 2014 following grace’s emergence from bankruptcy  the company for itself and its affiliates collectively the “sealed air parties” and grace for itself and its affiliates collectively the “grace parties” entered into a claims settlement agreement the “claims settlement” to resolve certain of th e parties’ claims against one another arising under the cryovac transaction agreements the “transaction claims” under the claims settlement the sealed air parties released and waived transaction claims against the grace parties other than asbestosrela ted claims freseniusrelated claims environmental claims insurance claims mass tort claims nonmonetary tax sharing agreement claims certain claims listed in annexes to proofs of claim filed by the sealed air companies in connection with the grace ba nkruptcy claims relating to certain matters described in the pi settlement plan certain executory contract claims relating to certain leased sites or sites that were divided as part of the cryovac transaction and certain indemnification claims under th e claims settlement the grace parties released and waived transaction claims against the sealed air companies other than nonmonetary tax sharing agreement claims certain executory contract claims relating to certain leased sites or sites that were divid ed as part of the cryovac transaction and certain indemnification claims the claims settlement also provides that the sealed air parties and the grace parties will share equally all fees and expenses relating to certain litigation brought by former cryov ac employees except to the extent that a claim is specifically referenced the claims settlement does not supersede or affect the obligations of the parties under the pi settlement plan or our settlement agreement 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that our liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated 

we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures

guarantees and indemnification obligations

note 18 stockholders’ equity 

repurchase of common stock

on july 9 2015 our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to  15 billion of the company’s common stock reflecting its commitment to return value to shareholders the repurchase program has no expiration date and replaced the previously authorized program which was terminated see part ii item 2 “unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds” for further information this program replaced our prior share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in august 2007 authorizing us to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock 

in march 2015 the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement the “march asr” with a thirdparty financial institution to repurchase 25 million of the company’s common stock upon completion of the transaction the company received a total of 546574 shares with an average price of 4574 per share these repurchases were made under the august 2007 share repurchase program approved by our board of directors referenced above

the dividend payments discussed above are recorded as reductions to cash and cash equivalents and retained earnings on our consolidated balance sheet our credit facility and our notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends however we do not believe these covenants are likely to materially limit the future payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock from time to time we may consider other means of returning value to our stockholders based on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations there is no guarantee that our board of directors will declare any further dividends 

common stock 

the following is a summary of changes during the three years ended december 31 2015 in shares of our common stock and common stock in treasury 

 



 

sharebased compensation 

in 2014 the board of directors adopted and its stockholders approved the 2014 omnibus incentive plan “omnibus incentive plan” under the omnibus incentive plan the maximum number of shares of common stock authorized was 4250000 plus total shares available to be issued as of may 22 2014 under the 2002 directors stock plan and the 2005 contingent stock plan collectively the “predecessor plans” the omnibus incentive plan replaced the predecessor plans and no further awards were granted under the predecessor plans the omnibus incentive plan provides for the grant of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units unrestricted stock performance share units known as psu awards other stock awards and cash awards to officers nonemployee directors key employees consultants and advisors

prior to the omnibus incentive plan the 2005 contingent stock plan represented our sole longterm equity compensation program for officers and employees the 2005 contingent stock plan provided for awards of equitybased compensation including restricted stock restricted stock units psu awards and cash awards measured by share price to our executive officers and other key employees as well as usbased key consultants prior to the omnibus incentive plan the 2002 directors stock plan provided for annual grants of shares to nonemployee directors and interim grants of shares to eligible directors elected at times other than at an annual meeting as all or part of the annual or interim retainer fees for nonemployee directors during 2002 we adopted a plan that permitted nonemployee directors to elect to defer all or part of their annual retainer until the nonemployee director retires from the board of directors the nonemployee director could elect to defer the portion of the annual retainer payable in shares of stock as well as the portion if any payable in cash cash dividends on deferred shares are reinvested into additional deferred units in each nonemployee director’s account 

a summary of the changes in common shares available for awards under the omnibus incentive plan and predecessor plans follows 

 



 







we record sharebased incentive compensation expense in selling general and administrative expenses and cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations for both equityclassified awards and liabilityclassified awards we record corresponding credit to additional paidin capital within stockholders’ equity for equityclassified awards and to either current or noncurrent liability for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of the sharebased incentive compensation awards at the date of grant total expense for the liabilityclassified awards continues to be remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period we recognize an expense or credit reflecting the straightline recognition net of estimated forfeitures of the expected cost of the program the number of psus earned may equal exceed or be less than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria are met surpassed or not met 

the following table summarizes the company ’ s pretax sharebased incentive compensation expense and related income tax benefit for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 related to the company ’ s psu awards slo awards and restricted stock awards 

 



 











restricted stock restricted stock units and cashsettled restricted stock unit awards

psu awards

threeyear psu awards for 2013 2014 and 2015exclude the 2014 special psu award 

during the first 90 days of each year the oc committee of our board of directors approves psu awards for our executive officers and other selected key executives which include for each officer or executive a target number of shares of common stock and performance goals and measures that will determine the percentage of the target award that is earned following the end of the threeyear performance period following the end of the performance period in addition to shares participants will also receive a cash payment in the amount of the dividends without interest that would have been paid during the performance period on the number of shares that they have earned each psu is subject to forfeiture if the recipient terminates employment with the company prior to the end of the threeyear award performance period for any reason other than death disability or retirement in the event of death disability or retirement a participant will receive a prorated payment based on such participant’s number of full months of service during the award performance period further adjusted based on the achievement of the performance goals during the award performance period all of these psus are classified as equity in the consolidated balance sheet 

the compensation committee established principal performance goals which are i total shareholder return for threeyear performance period weighted at 35 and ii third year consolidated adjusted ebitda margin weighted at 65 the total number of shares to be issued for these awards can range from zero to 200 of the target number of shares

psus – adjusted ebitda 

the psus granted based on adjusted ebitda are contingently awarded and will be payable in shares of the company’s common stock based on the company’s adjusted ebitda over a threeyear award performance period compared to a target set at the time of the grant by the compensation committee the fair value of the psus based on adjusted ebitda is based on grant date fair value which is equivalent to the closing price of one share of the company’s common stock on the date of grant the number of psus based on adjusted ebitda varies based on the probable outcome of the performance condition the company reassesses at each reporting date whether achievement of the performance condition is probable and accrues compensation expense if and when achievement of the performance condition is probable 

the number of psus granted based on adjusted ebitda and the grant date fair value are shown in the following table

 



 

psus – total shareholder return 

the psus granted based on total shareholder return are contingently awarded and will be payable in shares of the company’s common stock subject to the condition that the number of psus if any earned by the employees upon the expiration of a threeyear award performance period is dependent on the company’s total shareholder return ranking relative to a peer group of companies the fair value of the psus based on total shareholder return was estimated on the grant date using a monte carlo simulation model that incorporates predictive modeling techniques using geometric brownian motion and crystal ball’s random number generation other assumptions include the expected volatility of all companies included in the total shareholder return the historical share price returns analysis of all companies included in the total shareholder return and assumes dividends are reinvested the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility for a period of time that approximates the duration between the valuation date and the end of the performance period the riskfree interest rate is based on the zerocoupon treasury strip yield curve matching the term from the valuation date to the end of the performance period compensation expense for the psus based on total shareholder return which is considered a market condition is a fixed amount determined at the grant date fair value and is recognized 100 over the threeyear award performance period regardless of whether psus are awarded at the end of the award performance period

the number of psus granted based on total shareholder return and the assumptions used to calculate the grant date fair value of the psus based on total shareholder return are shown in the following table

2014 special psu award 

during march 2014 the compensation committee approved a special psu award to the named executive officers and a broader group of other employees the special psu awards are earned principally based on achievement of specified levels of free cash flow above targets established in the company’s threeyear strategic plan over the threeyear performance period of 20142016 in addition no portion of an award is earned unless we achieve a minimum specified level of adjusted earnings per share for 2016 in order to balance the free cash flow goal with an appropriate focus on generating earnings to further balance the incentives the award earned based on free cash flow performance will be reduced by 25 if our relative tsr for the performance period is below the 50th percentile of an approved peer group of companies any psus earned will be paid out in equal installments over two years in early 2017 and subject to an additional 2017 performance requirement in early 2018 

this award includes both equityclassified awards which do not get remeasured and liabilityclassified awards which get remeasured each reporting period  for equityclassified awards 641480 psus were granted based on performance conditions and the weighted average grant date fair value was 3210 213827 of psus were granted based on tsr and the weighted average grant date fair value wa s 1373 the expected price volatility and riskfree interest rate were 3290 and 068 respectively at december 31 2015 776047 psus remain unvested we record expense associated with the liabilityclassified awards in selling general and adminis trative expenses the liability recognized for liabilityclassified awards was 5 million and was included in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  

the unrecognized compensation expense for equityclassified awards and liabilityclassified awards combined was 18 million and weightedaverage remaining contractual life of approximately 20 year 

2012 president and chief operating officer coo fouryear incentive compensation

on september 1 2012 jerome a peribere started with the company as president and chief operating officer under the terms of his agreement he was granted equity awards which included the following i initial equity awards under the company’s 2005 contingent stock plan which included two awards of performance share units under which he could earn up to 350000 shares of common stock based on the company’s performance ii restricted stock under the company’s 2005 contingent stock plan of which 50000 shares were issued on his start date and 25000 shares to be issued on the first anniversary of his start date and iii an award under the company’s 2012 threeyear psu award with a target award of 140155 units the awards are described in further detail in mr peribere’s employment agreement filed with the sec as an exhibit with the company’s current report on form 8k dated august 27 2012

for the 2012 psu award excluding the portion of the psu awards related to the tsr goal that is discussed above the estimated amount of sharebased incentive compensation expense fluctuated based on the expected level of achievement of the respective goals and measures considered probable in each quarter which impacts the number of shares that could be issued 

since the tsr metric is considered a market condition the portion of the compensation expense related to the tsr metric included in the various awards above was or will be recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied provided that the requisite service has been provided

stock leverage opportunity awards

before the start of each performance year each of our executive officers and other selected key executives is eligible to elect to receive all or a portion of his or her annual cash bonus for that year in increments of 25 of the annual bonus as an award of restricted stock or restricted stock units under the omnibus incentive plan in lieu of cash the portion provided as an equity award may be given a premium to be determined by the compensation committee each year and will be rounded up to the nearest whole share the stock price used in the calculation of the number of shares will be the closing sale price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on the first trading day of the performance year the award will be granted following the end of the performance year and after determination by the compensation committee of the amount of the annual bonus award for each executive officer and other selected key executive who has elected to take all or a portion of his or her annual bonus as an equity award but no later than the march 15 following the end of the performance year

the equity award will be made in the form of an award of restricted stock units that will vest on the second anniversary of the grant date or earlier in the event of death disability or retirement from employment with us and the shares subject to the award will not be transferable by the recipient until the later of vesting or the second anniversary of the grant date termination treatment for the 2014 slo awards and later years has been changed from past grant practices for the “principal portion” of the award that would have otherwise been paid in cash the award vests upon any termination of employment other than for cause for the “premium portion” of the award equal to the additional 25 the award vests only in case of death disability or retirement from the company retirement for the purpose of slo awards and the psu awards described below means termination of employment after five or more years of employment and with years of employment plus age equal to 70 or more except termination for cause except as described above if the recipient ceases to be employed by the company prior to vesting then the award is forfeited except for certain circumstances following a change in control slo awards in the form of restricted stock units have no voting rights until shares are issued to them but do receive a cash payment in the amount of the dividends without interest on the shares they have earned at about the same time that shares are issued to them following the period of restriction as of december 31 2015 the amount of dividends earned on slo awards was immaterial

the 2015 slo awards comprise an aggregate of 78243 restricted stock units as of dece mber 31 2015 we record compensation expense for these awards in selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations with a corresponding credit to additional paidin capital within stockholders’ equity based on the fair value of the awards at the end of each reporting period which reflects the effects of stock price changes for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 compensation expense related to the slo awards was recognized based on the extent to whic h the performance goals and measures for our 2015 2014 and 2013 annual cash bonuses were considered probable of achievement at each respective year end the expense is recognized over a fifteen month period on a straightline basis which will be no later than march 15 2016 2015 and 2014 

stock appreciation rights “sars”

in connection with the acquisition of diversey sealed air exchanged diversey’s cashsettled stock appreciation rights and stock options that were unvested as of may 31 2011 and unexercised at october 3 2011 into cashsettled stock appreciation rights based on sealed air common stock since these sars are settled in cash the amount of the related future expense will fluctuate based on the forfeiture activity and the changes in the assumptions used in a blackscholes valuation model which include sealed air’s stock price riskfree interest rates expected volatility and a dividend yield in addition once vested the related expense will continue to fluctuate due to the changes in the assumptions used in the blackscholes option pricing model for any sars that are not exercised until their respective expiration dates the last of which is currently in february 2020

we recognized sars expense of 4 million 8 million and 38 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively cash payments due to the exercise of these sars were 21 million 21 million and 46 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as of december 31 2015 all of the outstanding sars were fully vested the remaining liability for these sars was 4 million and is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet

other common stock issuances 

we have historically issued shares of our common stock under our 2005 contingent stock plan to selected usbased consultants as compensation under consulting agreements primarily for research and development projects we record the cost associated with these issuances on a straightline basis based on each of the issuances’ vesting schedule current liability and unrecognized deferred compensation expense for these awards are not material as of december 31 2015

stock leverage opportunity awards “slo” 

the shares or units associated with the 2015 slo awards are considered contingently issuable shares and therefore are not included in the basic or diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year ended december 31 2015 these shares or units will not be included in the common shares outstanding until the final determination of the amount of annual incentive compensation is made in the first quarter of 2016 once this determination is made the shares or units will be included in diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding if the impact to diluted net earnings per common share is dilutive the numbers of shares or units associated with slo awards for 2015 2014 and 2013 were nominal

accelerating our penetration and rate of growth in developing regions 

with an international focus and extensive geographic footprint aligned to our growth opportunities we will combine our local market knowledge with our broad portfolio and strengths in innovation and customer service to grow in developing regions urbanization global trade increased protein consumption and the ongoing conversion to safer and hygienically packaged foods and goods are key secular trends that underpin our confidence in our ability to grow rapidly in these parts of the world 

focusing on cash flow generation and improved return on assets 

we are focused on generating substantial operating cash flow from our existing business so that we can continue to invest in new products and technologies deleverage our balance sheet continue to pay dividends and support growth in our share price we believe our ongoing process of critically analyzing our business portfolio and reallocating technical human and capital resources to the most promising market sectors from those sectors that are less strategic or have a lower level of financial performance will enhance our free cash flow generation performance and result in a higher return on assets thus improving shareholder value 

optimizing our cost base and operations to maximize efficiency and profitability 

the size and scale of our global operations affords us a continuing opportunity to derive greater supply chain efficiencies by leveraging our purchasing power optimizing our manufacturing and logistics footprint improving our internal operations and processes and reducing complexity and cost in addition to reducing the cost of our supply chain operations we continue to focus on adapting the cost structure of our customer facing and backoffice operations to the appropriate level required to adequately support our external customer base and run the business effectively we also have sustainability goals to reduce the environmental impact of our global operations and deliver operational excellence while upholding the highest ethical standards in our business practices every year our facilities around the world develop improvement plans to meet environmental impact and costreduction goals these align with corporate goals for energy greenhouse gases water waste efficiency targets and cost savings in turn the company’s impact on the environment is reduced while the ability to generate profits is enhanced 

developing our people 

we recognize that a core strength of our business is our people therefore we will continue to invest in the development of key skills in our diverse workforce while improving our ability to attract and retain new employees who are motivated by our company vision and the positive impact they can have on the world

in maintaining our foreign operations we face risks inherent in these operations such as currency fluctuations inflation and political instability information on currency exchange risk appears in part ii item 7a of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference other risks attendant to our foreign operations are set forth in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference information on the impact of currency exchange on our consolidated financial statements appears in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” financial information showing net sales and total longlived assets by geographic region for each of the three years ended december 31 2014 appears in note 4 “segments” which information is incorporated herein by reference we maintain programs to comply with the various laws rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countries in which we operate see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and “environmental matters” 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 24000 employees worldwide approximately 8000 of these employees were in the us with approximately 150 of these employees covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 16000 employees who were outside the us approximately 9800 were covered by collective bargaining agreements outside of the us many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 

marketing distribution and customers 

at december 31 2014 we employed approximately 7100 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers

we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2014 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

seasonality 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our diversey care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter second quarter sales represent a modest seasonal increase due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging and the third and fourth quarters of the year are relatively the same level as the second quarter net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price there are also other companies producing competing products that are wellestablished since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership we invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year as compared with our packaging peers 

there are other manufacturers of food care products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the us 

our food care hygiene solutions and diversey care solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach we compete globally on premium product offerings and application expertise innovative product and dispensing equipment offerings valueadded solution delivery and strong customer service and support we differentiate our offerings from competitors by becoming the preferred partner to our customers and by providing innovative industryleading products to make their facilities safer and healthier for both maintenance staff and building occupants we believe our integrated solutions approach which includes the supply of machines tools chemicals processes and training to customers to drive productivity improvements reduce total cost of ownership reduce risk of food safety events and improve infection control to reduce healthcare acquired infections is a unique competitive strength additionally the quality ease of use and environmental profile of our products are unique and have helped support longstanding profitable relationships with many top customers 

our product care products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts and wood blocking and bracing systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products 

competition for most of our medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price 

raw materials and sourcing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components equipment accessories and contract manufactured goods our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants chelates fragrances and paper and wood pulp products these raw materials represent approximately 40 of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials baginthebox containers bottles drums pails totes aerosol cans caps triggers valves and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment dilutioncontrol warewashing and laundry equipment floor care machines and items used in the maintenance of a facility such as air care dispensers floor care applicators microfiber mops and cloths buckets carts and other cleaning tools and utensils 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we source some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global sourcing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of procurement and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve sourcing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent sourcing practices 

research and development activities 

we maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and improve our existing products and processes including developing new packaging chemical formulations and equipment and related applications using our intellectual property from time to time we also license or acquire technology developed by others our research and development projects rely on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science chemistry and chemical engineering package design and equipment engineering our research and development expense was 135 million in 2014 133 million in 2013 and 135 million in 2012

our research and development activities are focused on enduse application as a result we operate 







patents and trademarks 

we are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over 4200 us and foreign patents and patent applications as well as an aggregate of over 10600 united states and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage we file annually an average of 300 us and foreign patent applications and 400 us and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements in the us we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the us environmental protection agency “epa” we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the us these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees

risk factors 

tableend

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers hotels restaurants retail establishments other retailers business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in 62 countries and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the us and a majority of our net sales are generated outside of the us operations outside of the us particularly operations in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 



























in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows

we are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or regions in which we or our customers or suppliers operate including civil unrest acts of terrorism sabotage epidemics force majeure war or other armed conflict and related government actions including sanctionsembargoes the deprivation of contract rights the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials the expropriation or nationalization of our assets and restrictions on travel payments or the movement of funds in particular if additional restrictions on trade with russia were adopted by the european union or the us and were applicable to our products we could lose sales and experience lower growth rates in the future​

although the settlement agreement as defined in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace as defined below if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan as defined below and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we are also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 sealed air completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities since the beginning of 2000 we have been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction we are responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries while they vary these suits all appear to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders dated may 3 2001 and january 22 2002 staying all asbestos actions against the company the “preliminary injunction” however the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” received the court’s permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction this proceeding was brought in the us district court for the district of delaware the “district court” adv no 0202210 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates in connection with the cryovac transaction the settlement agreement provided for the resolution of the fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction the parties to the agreement in principle signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court signed an order approving the settlement agreement although grace is not a party to the settlement agreement under the terms of the order grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions 

on september 19 2008 grace the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the asbestos pi future claimants’ representative and the official committee of equity security holders filed as coproponents a plan of reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the “plan” and several exhibits and associated documents including a disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court the plan provides for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the united states bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the plan incorporates the settlement agreement including our payment of amounts contemplated by the settlement agreement and the releases and injunctions contemplated by the settlement agreement 

on february 3 2014 the “effective date” the plan implementing the settlement agreement became effective with grace emerging from bankruptcy in accordance with the plan and the settlement agreement on the effective date cryovac inc made aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and transferred 18 million shares of sealed air common stock to the pi trust in each case reflecting adjustments made in accordance with the settlement agreement under the plan the preliminary injunction remained in place through the effective date and on the effective date the plan and settlement agreement injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims became effective following the effective date the bankruptcy court issued an order dismissing the proceedings pursuant to which the preliminary injunction was issued the plan further provides for the channeling of existing and future asbestos claims to the pi trust or the pd trust as applicable in addition under the plan and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

since november 2004 the company and specified subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of grace’s alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos containing products in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace has agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by grace has been approved by the canadian court and the plan provides for payment of these claims we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us became operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in grace’s united states chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code as indicated above the bankruptcy court entered the bankruptcy court confirmation order on january 31 2011 and the clarifying order on february 15 2011 and the district court entered the original district court confirmation order on january 30 2012 and the amended district court confirmation order on june 11 2012 the canadian court issued an order on april 8 2011 recognizing and giving full effect to the bankruptcy court’s confirmation order in all provinces and territories of canada in accordance with the bankruptcy court confirmation order’s terms as described above the plan became effective on february 3 2014 in accordance with an order of the canadian court on the effective date the actions became permanently stayed until they are amended to remove the grace parties as named defendants two actions were dismissed by the manitoba court as against the grace parties on february 19 2014 and it is anticipated that the remaining actions will now also be dismissed notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay substantial damages which we cannot estimate at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations for further information concerning these matters see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to affect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indenture governing certain of our senior notes these notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 





















in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 









in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2014 we had 1313 billion of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 16 million increase or a 16 million decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical based raw materials and energy could increase our costs in addition the prices of many of the other key raw materials used in our businesses such as caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants polymers and resins chelates and fragrances are cyclical based on numerous supply and demand factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

 

unfavorable consumer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and earnings 

 

from time to time and especially in periods of rising raw material costs we increase the prices of our products significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on among other factors the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by the customers to higher prices such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact earnings 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets may be affected by a number of factors including our earnings in the us 

we have deferred tax assets including us and foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances foreign tax credits accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize these assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

our largest deferred tax asset is our net operating loss carry forwards and most of this asset relates to our us net operating loss the benefit from the amount carried forward may depend upon among other factors our anticipated future earnings in the us a reduction in our anticipated us earnings could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods in which any such condition occurs in addition changes in statutory tax rates or other legislation or regulation may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate 

we may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs

we have implemented a number of restructuring programs in the last few years including our fusion program earnings quality improvement program eqip and integration and optimization program iop these programs include various cost savings and reorganization initiatives including the relocation of our corporate headquarters to charlotte north carolina the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount we have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated synergies we expect to achieve under such programs which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities these assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors in addition our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control if we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as porcine epidemic diarrhea or “ped” bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as “mad cow” disease footandmouth disease avian influenza or “birdflu” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products in recent years occasional cases of ped and “mad cow” disease have been confirmed and incidents of birdflu have surfaced in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system

we are currently engaged in a multiyear process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system “erp” the erp is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes accurately maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team the erp will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties as a result any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the erp could adversely affect our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders apply cash receipts place purchase orders with suppliers and make cash disbursements and could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations which may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades to those systems while we implement the new erp system while we have invested significant resources in planning and project management significant implementation issues may arise

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in the food processing and food service industries consumer preferences for food and packaging formats of prepackaged food can influence our sales as can consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods changes in consumer behavior including changes in consumer preferences driven by various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

customers in the food service food and beverage processing building care lodging industrial distribution and healthcare sectors have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

the market for our hygiene products is highly competitive our hygiene products businesses face significant competition from global national regional and local companies within some or all of our product lines in each sector that we serve barriers to entry and expansion in the institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene industry are low 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products additionally we may not successfully implement our pricing actions these factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

concerns about greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials and freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits it is also possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

strengthening of the us dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 65 of our net sales in 2014 were generated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 

also while we often produce in the same geographic markets as our products are sold expenses are more concentrated in the us than sales so that in a time of strengthening of the us dollar our profit margins could be reduced while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — foreign exchange rates — venezuela” 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens and a more stringent manner in which they are applied particularly in the us could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole this includes among other things the possible taxation under us law of certain income from foreign operations compliance costs and enforcement under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act and costs associated with complying with the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder

for example under section 1502 of the doddfrank act the sec has adopted additional disclosure requirements related to the source of certain “conflict minerals” for issuers for which such “conflict minerals” are necessary to the functionality or product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by that issuer the metals covered by the rules include tin tantalum tungsten and gold commonly referred to as “3tg” our suppliers may use some or all of these materials in their production processes the secs rules require us to perform due diligence on our suppliers global supply chains can have multiple layers thus the costs of complying with these requirements could be substantial these requirements may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict free metals and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices compliance costs and the unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

as another example the affordable care act the “aca” which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years significantly affects the provision of both healthcare services and benefits in the us the aca may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business we provide benefits to our employees which are competitive within the industries in which we operate the aca did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2014 2013 or 2012 however we are continuing to assess the impact of the aca on our healthcare benefit costs the regulatory environment is still developing and the potential exists for future legislation and regulations to be adopted these developments as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate income tax provision changes in statutory tax rates and laws as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us for example legislative proposals to change us taxation of nonus earnings could increase our effective tax rate also changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate in addition our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure we are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies adverse developments in these laws or regulations or any change in position regarding the application administration or interpretation thereof in any applicable jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations in addition the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the us may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations 

our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and third party information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations 

we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets as a result of the acquisition of diversey and we may never realize the full carrying value of these assets 

as a result of the acquisition of diversey we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment may result from among other things i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessment by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we recorded impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in 2012 see note 7 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for further discussion 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

the relationship with sc johnson  son inc “scj” is important to our diversey care segment and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on this segment 

diversey is party to various agreements with scj under which it is granted a license in specified territories to sell certain scj products and use specified trade names owned by scj in the institutional and industrial channels of trade and subject to certain limitations in specified channels of trade in which both our diversey care segment and scj’s consumer business operate which expires within the next few years although the term of this agreement may be extended it is uncertain that the parties will agree to do so sales of these scj products have historically been significant to our diversey care segment if we default under our agreements with scj and the agreements are terminated scj fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with scj is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our diversey care segment consolidated financial condition or results of operations

the relationship with unilever plc “unilever” is important to our diversey care segment and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on this segment 

diversey is a party to various agreements with unilever under which it is granted a license to produce and sell professional size packs of unilever’s consumer brand cleaning products in the institutional and industrial channels of trade which expires within the next few years with the exception of a subset of the uk business although the term of this agreement may be extended it is uncertain that the parties will agree to do so in four countries the united kingdom ireland portugal and brazil the diversey subsidiaries operate under an agency agreement with unilever in addition diversey also holds licenses to use some trademarks and technology of unilever in the market for institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene products and related services if we default under our agreements with unilever and the agreements are terminated unilever fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with unilever is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our diversey care segment consolidated financial condition or results of operations

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies if any of our senior management or other key personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business 

we are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water and the use handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our european operations as a result of a european union “eu” directive “registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals” eu directive no 20061907 enacted on december 18 2006 the directive imposes several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical substances manufactured or marketed in europe the eu has also recently enacted a “classification packaging and labeling” regulation other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the legacy diversey business had tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever pursuant to the unilever acquisition agreement as defined below 

under a previous acquisition agreement between the legacy diversey business and unilever the “unilever acquisition agreement” unilever made warranties to diversey with respect to the facilities formerly owned by unilever in addition unilever agreed to indemnify diversey for specified types of environmental liabilities if the aggregate amount of damages meets various dollar thresholds subject to a cap of 250 million in the aggregate diversey was required to notify unilever of any environmental indemnification claims by may 3 2008 any environmental claims pending after this date with respect to which diversey has notified unilever remain subject to indemnification until remediation is completed in accordance with the unilever acquisition agreement 

diversey has previously tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever in connection with former unilever locations unilever has not indicated its agreement with diversey’s request for indemnification we may file additional requests for reimbursement in the future in connection with pending indemnification claims however there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover any amounts relating to these indemnification claims from unilever 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products this loss of a competitive advantage could result in decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the us and in other countries where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the us and in the foreign countries in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to mitigate these risks our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

manufacturing facilities by reportable segment and other 

food care we produce food care products in 59 manufacturing facilities of which 15 are in north america 16 in europe 11 in latin america 11 in amat and 6 in janz 

diversey care we produce diversey care products in 18 manufacturing facilities of which 4 are in north america 5 in europe 3 in latin america 5 in amat and 1 in janz 

product care we produce product care products in 67 manufacturing facilities of which 30 are in north america 17 in europe 7 in latin america 10 in amat and 3 in janz 

other we produce medical applications products in 3 manufacturing facilities of which 1 is in north america and 2 are in europe we produce other products in 3 manufacturing facilities of which 2 are in north america and 1 is in europe 

other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the us and in many foreign countries some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some on those that we lease standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters are currently located in a leased facility in charlotte north carolina for a list of those countries outside of the us where we have operations see “global operations” above 

we believe that our manufacturing warehouse office and other facilities are well maintained suitable for their purposes and adequate for our needs

at december 31 2014 we were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “superfund” sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2014 environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the information in this mda should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in part ii item 8 as well as the discussion included in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k all amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions except per share amounts 

on december 6 2013 we completed the sale of the rigid medical packaging business and accordingly the operating results were reclassified to discontinued operations net of tax on the consolidated statements of operations for 2013 and 2012 on november 14 2012 we completed the sale of diversey japan and accordingly the operating results were reclassified to discontinued operations net of tax on the consolidated statements of operations for 2012 see note 3 “divestitures” for further details all results and discussion included in this mda are presented on a continuing operations basis 

effective as of january 1 2014 we changed our segment reporting structure in order to reflect the way management now makes operating decisions and manages the growth and profitability of the business this change corresponds with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources and assessing the performance of our segments we report our segment information in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 280 “segment reporting” “fasb asc topic 280” there has been no change in our total consolidated financial condition or results of operations previously reported as a result of the change in our segment structure there were no changes to the reportable segment assets as a result of the change in segment reporting 

as a result the company’s new segment reporting structure consists of three reportable segments and an “other” category and is as follows 









see note 4 “segments” for further information 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 we changed the method of valuing our inventories that used the lastin firstout lifo method to the firstin firstout fifo method so that all of our inventories are now valued at fifo certain amounts have been revised to reflect the retrospective application of this change in inventory costing method for certain us inventories to the fifo method from the lifo method refer to note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies  inventories” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details surrounding this accounting policy change

overview 

we are a global leader in food safety and security facility hygiene and product protection we serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing food service retail healthcare and industrial and commercial and consumer applications our focus is on achieving quality sales growth through leveraging our geographic footprint technological knowhow and leading market positions to bring measureable sustainable value to our customers employees and investors we have widely recognized and inventive brands such as cryovac ® packaging technology diversey ® and taski ® brand cleaning and hygiene solutions and our bubble wrap ® brand cushioning jiffy ® protective mailers and instapak ® foaminplace systems 

as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 7100 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2014 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our diversey care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter second quarter sales represent a modest seasonal increase due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging and the third and fourth quarters of the year are relatively the same level as the second quarter net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be higher in the second half of the year reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership our food care hygiene solutions and diversey care solutions businesses face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach for more details see “competition” included in part i item 1 “business” 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders 

highlights of financial performance 

below are the highlights of our financial performance for the three years ended december 31 2014 

 



 

 









diluted net earnings per common share 

the following table presents a reconciliation of our us gaap eps to nonus gaap adjusted eps 

 



 

 









for 2014 special items primarily included restructuring and other associated costs related to our restructuring programs of 102 million 84 million net of taxes foreign currency exchange losses related to venezuelan subsidiaries of 20 million 20 million net of taxes loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities of 103 million 67 million net of taxes and costs related to development grant matter of 14 million 14 million net of taxes these amounts were partially offset by our gain on claims settlement of 21 million and 46 million of additional tax benefits directly and indirectly related to the grace settlement including the release of reserve related to unrecognized tax benefits valuation allowances and unremitted earnings 

for 2013 special items primarily included restructuring and other charges of 74 million 59 million net of taxes and associated costs of 26 million 18 million net of taxes related to both eqip and iop 50 million increase to the valuation allowance in connection with the deferred tax asset related to the settlement agreement loss on debt redemption of 36 million 24 million net of taxes write down of nonstrategic assets of 5 million 3 million net of taxes and foreign currency exchange losses related to venezuelan subsidiaries of 13 million 11 million net of taxes for 2012 these items primarily included i impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets ii restructuring charges and iii loss on debt redemption 

for 2012 for purposes of calculating adjusted eps the dilutive impact of i the effect of the assumed issuance of 18 million shares of common stock reserved for the settlement agreement and ii the effect of nonvested restricted stock and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method was included because we reported adjusted net earnings for 2012 these shares differ from the shares used to calculate net loss per common share included in the consolidated statement of operations for us gaap reporting purposes because we reported a net loss for 2012 which does not include the effect of the items mentioned above as the effect was antidilutive see note 21 “net earnings loss per common share” for details on the calculation of our us gaap basic and diluted eps and “nonus gaap information” above for further details 

our us gaap and nonus gaap income taxes are as follows 

 



 



foreign currency translation impact on consolidated financial results 

since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated financial results into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our financial results from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact historically the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro the australian dollar the brazilian real the british pound the canadian dollar and the mexican peso 

the following table presents the approximate favorable or unfavorable impact foreign currency translation had on some of our consolidated financial results

components of change in net sales by segment 

the following tables present the components of change in net sales by our segment reporting structure for 2014 compared with 2013 and 2013 compared with 2012 we also present the change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation a nonus gaap measure which we define as “constant dollar” we believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability between periods as it eliminates the volatility of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 



 





the following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis 

food care 

2014 compared with 2013 

the 138 million or 4 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to





these favorable drivers were partially offset by lower unit volumes in north america of 26 million or 2 in latin america of 17 million or 3 largely attributable to a decline in beef production in north america and ped virus impact related to the pork market in both north america and mexico

2013 compared with 2012 

the 123 million or 3 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to 





diversey care 

2014 compared with 2013 

the 65 million or 3 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to 





these favorable drivers were offset by lower unit volumes in europe 14 million or 1 due to the continuing economic challenges in this region and our customer and product rationalization efforts

2013 compared with 2012 

the 44 million or 2 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to







these favorable factors were offset by lower unit volumes in europe of 13 million or 1 due to the economic challenges in this region 

product care 

2014 compared with 2013 

the 58 million or 4 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to 





2013 compared with 2012 

the 38 million or 2 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to 





cost of sales 

cost of sales for the three years ended december 31 2014 was as follows 

 



2014 compared with 2013 

cost of sales was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 125 million on a constant dollar basis cost of sales increased 87 million or 2 primarily due to







these factors were partially offset by favorable impact of cost synergies of 47 million and other supply chain efficiencies

we anticipate raw material costs will have a favorable impact on cost of sales in 2015 as compared with 2014 however we also expect an unfavorable impact on net earnings related to foreign currency our pricing actions could be placed under negative pressure due to declines in raw material costs and could result in a loss of sales volumes as certain customers may choose to purchase products from our competitors at lower prices 

2013 compared with 2012 

cost of sales was impacted by a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 62 million on a constant dollar basis cost of sales increased 128 million or 3 some of the factors that contributed to the increase in cost of sales were









these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of





cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased in the last three years primarily reflecting manufacturing efficiency improvements and synergies from our restructuring programs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for the three years ended december 31 2014 are included in the table below 

 



 

2014 compared with 2013 

sga expenses were impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 29 million on a constant dollar basis sga expenses increased 117 million or 7 this increase was primarily due to















these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost synergies of 50 million realized from our restructuring activities

2013 compared with 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses were impacted by a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 9 million on a constant dollar basis selling general and administrative expenses increased 2 million primarily due to 







these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost synergies associated with iop of 68 million 

amortization expense of intangible assets acquired 

amortization expense of intangible assets acquired for the three years ended december 31 2014 was as follows 

 



 

amortization expense of intangible was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 1 million on a constant dollar basis amortization expenses decreased 3 million or 3 this decrease was primarily due to certain license agreements and software which we acquired as part of the diversey acquisition which were fully amortized as of september 2014 

the decrease in amortization expense in 2013 as compared with 2012 was primarily due to the impact of the noncash impairment charge recorded in 2012 which lowered the carrying value of certain intangible assets acquired which in turn resulted in lower amortization expense in 2013 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

during the third quarter of 2012 due to the continuing unfavorable economic conditions primarily in europe and north america we reevaluated the near and longterm expected business performance of our diversey business our diversey business had experienced operating results that were significantly lower than expected during the first half of 2012 and lower than originally forecasted at the time of the acquisition of diversey in 2011 also during the third quarter of 2012 we started our annual multiyear strategic forecasting and planning process which is prepared for all reporting units in the second half of each year in connection with this process we reevaluated the near and longterm expected business performance of the diversey business and considered the longterm market conditions and business trends within each of the diversey regional reporting units as a result of our reevaluation we determined that our european business was not expected to achieve any significant growth until late 2013 or 2014 additionally in north america we were not able to pass along to our customers increases in raw material costs that began in late 2011 and continued into 2012 consequently causing margins to be significantly lower than originally expected also the impact of lower sales and increases in raw material costs in latin america caused that region’s operating results to be lower than expected when we factored the impact of these unfavorable conditions into our strategic forecasting and planning process we determined that these were significant indicators of potential impairment in accordance with asc 350 “intangiblesgoodwill and other” accordingly we performed an interim impairment test for both the goodwill and longlived assets of the diversey european north american and latin american reporting units 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we began to operate under our new business division structure which created the diversey care and hygiene solutions which is included in the food care segment reporting units from the previous legacy diversey segment in connection with this new business division structure we revised our multiyear forecast under the new reporting unit structure 

included in the revised multiyear forecast was our expectation that there would be further economic weakness in europe particularly in southern europe which was more severe than we initially forecasted during our third quarter 2012 interim impairment review the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units both derive a significant portion of their revenue from europe also included in the revised multiyear forecast for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units were the reported results for these reporting units for the fourth quarter of 2012 the reported results for both the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units were lower than originally forecasted at the end of the third quarter of 2012 in particular the diversey care reporting unit experienced lower volumes in its consumer brands and lower equipment sales in europe as compared with the fourth quarter of 2011 in addition the diversey care reporting unit continued to incur higher sales and marketing expenses compared with the fourth quarter of 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2012 several new members of our senior management team believed that a new and enhanced business strategy was required to successfully operate both the diversey care and hygiene solutions businesses the combination of the factors mentioned above unfavorably impacted our near and longterm forecasted revenues and cash flows for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units 

at december 31 2012 we considered the factors mentioned above including our new business division structure and we determined that further indicators of impairment were present accordingly we performed an interim assessment of impairment of our goodwill and longlived assets for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units 

in 2012 we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 1892 million of goodwill and other intangible assets 

as part of our evaluation in 2014 and 2013 the profitability and operating performance of the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units showed improvement compared to 2012 this operating performance improvement was factored into our annual multiyear strategic forecasting and planning process which was prepared for all of our reporting units in the second half of each year in connection with this process we evaluated the near and longterm expected business performance of all the reporting units and considered the longterm market conditions and business trends within each of the reporting units as a result of this annual evaluation there was no indication of impairment for any of the reporting units in 2014 and 2013 

see note 7 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill reviews performed in 2014 2013 and 2012 and other related information 

stock appreciation rights expense 

sars expense for the three years ended december 31 2014 is as follows 

 



 

sars expense includes the impact of changes in the share price of our common stock the share price of our common stock increased 25 in 2014 as compared to an increase of approximately 94 in 2013 see note 18 “stockholder’s equity” for further details of our sars program as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 600000 sars outstanding of which approximately 300000 were unvested and will vest entirely by march 31 2015 

integration related costs 

we recorded integration related costs approximately 4 million in 2014 1 million in 2013 and 7 million in 2012 these costs primarily consist of professional and consulting fees 

restructuring activities 

fusion 

on december 18 2014 the board of directors of the company approved a new restructuring plan the “fusion program” or the “plan” which consists of a portfolio of restructuring projects across all of our divisions as part of our transformation of sealed air corporation into a knowledgebased company including reduction in headcount and consolidation and relocation of certain facilities and offices including the relocation of the company’s headquarters to charlotte nc as announced on july 23 2014 

the company currently estimates that it will incur aggregate costs of approximately 275 million to 285 million in connection with the implementation of this plan the net cash cost of the plan is expected to be in the range of 210 million to 220 million the costs associated with the plan the majority of which are expected to be incurred between 2015 and 2017 will primarily consist of i a reduction in headcount through reorganization and integration including severance and termination benefits for employees expected to be approximately 115 million to 120 million and ii other costs associated with the plan primarily relating to the rationalization consolidation and relocation of certain portions of our global supply chain and other facilities and offices expected to be approximately 160 million to 165 million included in the total cash costs the company anticipates approximately 55 million to 65 million of capital expenditures related to the plan of which the majority is expected to be incurred between 2015 and 2016 the plan is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2017 

the plan is currently estimated to generate annualized synergies of approximately 80 million to 85 million by the end of 2018 additionally the plan is expected to generate cash and benefits of approximately 65 million from the sale of certain assets state and local incentives in connection with the relocation of the company’s headquarters and reductions in working capital these amounts are preliminary estimates based on the information currently available to management 

earnings quality improvement program eqip 

on may 1 2013 we commenced with our eqip which is an initiative to deliver meaningful cost savings and network optimization the plan is estimated to generate annualized savings of approximately 90110 million by the end of 2016 we achieved 69 million incremental cost synergies in 2014 related to this program compared with 2013 we achieved these synergies in cost of sales 28 million and in selling general and administrative expenses 41 million primarily in our food care and diversey care divisions

integration and optimization program iop 

in december 2011 we initiated a restructuring program associated with the integration of diversey’s business following our acquisition of diversey on october 3 2011 this program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2015 we achieved 27 million incremental cost synergies in 2014 related to this program compared with 2013 we achieved these synergies in cost of sales 18 million and in selling general and administrative expenses 9 million primarily in our food care and diversey care divisions 

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to the programs described above and our relocation activities is subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later than expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending and benefits and cost synergies see note 9 “restructuring and relocation activities” for further discussion of the costs cash payments and liabilities associated with these programs and relocation activities 

adjusted ebitda by segment 

as of january 1 2014 the company changed the segment measure in which the management assesses segment performance and makes allocation decisions by segment from operating profit a us gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda a nonus gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude the impact of special items see “use of nonus gaap information” above for a discussion of special items and further information of our use of nonus gaap measures 

we allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments although property and equipment net is not allocated to the segment assets nor is depreciation and amortization included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda we also allocate and disclose restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment although it is not included in the segment performance metric adjusted ebitda since restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are categorized as special items the accounting policies of the reportable segments and other are the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements 

see note 4 “segments” for the reconciliation of nonus gaap adjusted ebitda to us gaap net earnings from continuing operations and other segment details 

 



 



the following is a discussion of the factors that contributed to the change in adjusted ebitda by segment in the three years ended december 31 2014 as compared with the prior year 

food care 

2014 compared with 2013 

adjusted ebitda was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 20 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda increased 75 million or 12 in 2014 compared with the same period in 2013 primarily due to the impact of





these favorable drivers were partially offset by





2013 compared with 2012 

the increase in food care’s adjusted ebitda was primarily due to the impact of cost synergies associated with iop of 58 million impact of higher volumes of 20 million and the impact of favorable productprice mix and manufacturing efficiency improvements of 25 million these factors were partially offset by higher performance based annual incentive compensation of 21 million higher selling general and administrative expenses incurred in support of the increase in net sales as well as nonmaterial supply chain inflation 

diversey care 

2014 compared with 2013 

adjusted ebitda was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 10 million on a constant dollar basis adjusted ebitda increased 18 million or 8 in 2014 compared with the same period in 2013 primarily due to the impact of

the decline in product care’s adjusted ebitda was primarily due to unfavorable impact of nonmaterial supply chain inflation costs higher selling general and administrative expenses and higher performance based annual incentive compensation of 7 million these factors were partially offset by incremental cost synergies associated with iop of 19 million and the impact of higher volumes of 16 million 

other 

2014 compared with 2013 

this category’s adjusted ebitda loss increased 12 million in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to higher information systems expense of 8 million in corporate related to our erp software implementations and upgrades in 2014 additionally lower volumes in our medical applications and new venture business had an unfavorable impact of 7 million 

2013 compared with 2012 

the increase in other adjusted ebitda was primarily due to the favorable impact of positive pricemix and lower research and development costs as a result of the decision we made to abandon future development work on a project included in our new ventures business

loss on debt redemption 

in the fourth quarter 2014 we issued 425 million of 4875 senior notes due december 1 2022 and 425 million of 5125 senior notes due december 1 2024 the proceeds from these notes were used to repurchase the company’s 750 million 8125 senior notes due september 2019 the aggregate repurchase price was 837 million which included the principal amount of 750 million a premium of 75 million and accrued interest of 13 million we recognized a total pretax loss of 84 million on the repurchase which included the premiums mentioned above also included in the loss on debt redemption was 9 million of accelerated amortization of original nonlender fees related to the 8125 senior notes due september 2019 

on july 25 2014 we entered into a second restatement agreement the “second restatement agreement” whereby our senior secured credit facility was amended and restated the “second amended and restated credit agreement” with bank of america na as agent and the other financial institutions party thereto on august 29 2014 we completed the 100 million delayed draw of the term loan a facility in connection with this loan we also entered into interest rate and currency swaps in a notional amount of 100 million which convert our floating us dollar denominated obligation under the term loan a into a fixed rate brazilian real denominated obligation as a result of the second restatement agreement we recognized 18 million of loss on debt redemption in our consolidated statements of operations this amount includes 13 million of accelerated amortization of original issuance discount related to the term loan b and lender and nonlender fees related to the entire credit facility also included in the loss on debt redemption was 5 million of nonlender fees incurred in connection with the second restatement agreement in addition we incurred 2 million of lender fees that are included in the carrying amounts of the outstanding debt under the credit facility we also capitalized 5 million of nonlender fees that are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 

in november 2013 we amended our senior secured credit facility the “amended credit facility” the amendment refinanced the term loan b facilities with a 525 million term loan b dollar tranche and a €128 million term loan b euro tranche in connection therewith among other things i the interest margin on each tranche was decreased by 075 and ii the minimum eurocurrency rate under the term loan b facilities was reduced from 100 to 075 we prepaid 101 million and refinanced the remaining principal amount of 697 million of the euro and us dollar denominated portions of the original term loan b at 100 of their face value we recognized a 4 million pretax loss on debt redemption included in our results of operations for 2013 consisting of accelerated unamortized original issuance discount unamortized fees and fees associated with the transaction

see note 11 “debt and credit facilities” for details of our debt transactions 

impairment of equity method investments 

in 2014 we recognized an impairment of 6 million in connection with an equity method investment this investment was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in 2013 we recognized an impairment of 2 million in connection with an equity method investment this investment was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in september 2007 we established a joint venture that supports our food care segment we account for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of net income or losses included in other expense net on the consolidated statements of operations 

during the first half of 2012 the joint venture performed below expectations resulting in reduced cash flow and increasing debt obligations due to these events we evaluated our equity method investment for impairment during the three months ended june 30 2012 based on reviewing undiscounted cash flow information we determined that the fair value of our investment was less than its carrying value and that this impairment was otherthantemporary as a result we recorded a 4 million writedown of the carrying value of the investment to zero at june 30 2012

in connection with the establishment of the joint venture in 2007 we issued a guarantee in support of an uncommitted credit facility agreement that was entered into by the joint venture under the terms of the guarantee if the joint venture were to default under the terms of the credit facility the lender would be entitled to seek payment of the amounts due under the credit facility from us as a result of the impairment we believed it was probable we would need to perform under this guarantee and recorded a 20 million current liability in the second quarter of 2012 included in impairment of equity method investment on the consolidated statement of operations the guarantee liability is reflected in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014 and 2013 as we continue to believe it is probable that we will need to perform under this guarantee as of december 31 2014 the joint venture has performed its obligations under the terms of the credit facility and the lender has not requested that we perform under the terms of the guarantee

 

total charges recorded in the second quarter of 2012 were 26 million 18 million net of taxes or 009 per diluted share which included the guarantee of the uncommitted credit facility mentioned above of 20 million and the 4 million writedown of the carrying value of the investment to zero at june 30 2012 we also recorded provisions for bad debt on receivables due from the joint venture to the company of 2 million which is included in selling general and administrative expenses we have no additional obligations to support the operations of the joint venture in the future 

 

the impairment and related provision for bad debt on receivables are considered special items and excluded from our adjusted ebitda results

foreign currency exchange losses gains related to venezuelan subsidiaries 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy the foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2014 2013 and 2012 for our venezuelan subsidiary were the result of two factors 1 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to settle bolivardenominated transactions and 2 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements at the balance sheet date we believe these gains and losses are attributable to the unstable foreign currency environment in venezuela see “venezuela” in “foreign exchange rates” of item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion on venezuela 

gain from claims settlement 

on february 3 2014 we entered into the settlement agreement under the settlement agreement we released and waived certain claims against the grace parties and the grace parties released and waived certain claims against us as a result we recognized a gain of 21 million in 2014 which consisted of the release of 17 million of certain tax liabilities and 4 million of other associated liabilities see note 17 “commitments and contingencies – settlement agreement and related costs” for more details on the settlement agreement

income taxes 

the table below shows our effective income tax rate from continuing operations “etr” as retrospectively changed to account for our change from lifo to fifo see note 2 see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies – inventories” for additional details regarding this accounting policy change 

 



 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 34 for 2014 the primary reasons for our reduced tax rate were the following items









our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 471 for 2013 primarily due to our increase of approximately 50 million as a result of not funding the settlement agreement before the end of 2013 the delay in funding required us to increase our valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to the settlement agreement excluding that increase our tax rate would have been approximately 19 our tax rate for the year benefited from earnings in jurisdictions with low tax rates and losses in jurisdictions such as the us with high tax rates as well as various reorganizations and a retroactive reinstatement of certain tax provisions that were recorded as discrete items in 2013 on january 2 2013 the president signed the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 retroactively reinstating and extending the research and development tax credit and certain foreign tax provisions from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 

we expect a core tax rate of approximately 25 in 2015 

our effective income tax rate also depends on the realization of our deferred tax assets net of our valuation allowances our deferred tax assets include us and foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances foreign tax credits accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes employee benefit items and other items 

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carry back any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize these assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reverse those valuation allowances 

our largest deferred tax asset is comprised of net operating loss carry forwards in 2014 we funded the settlement agreement and are carrying forward a portion of the amount we contributed to the trusts we have additional net operating losses in various foreign jurisdictions see note 16 “income taxes” for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate which also shows the major components of the year over year changes and other tax information 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

principal sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our amended credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses investments in working capital capital expenditures interest taxes dividends debt obligations restructuring expenses and other longterm liabilities we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months 

on february 3 2014 we funded the 930 million settlement agreement and accrued interest liability using cash on hand and committed liquidity to fund the cash payment we used 555 million of cash and cash equivalents and utilized borrowings of 260 million from our revolving credit facility and 115 million from our accounts receivable securitization programs also on february 14 2014 we repaid our 12 senior notes on their maturity date with available cash on hand and committed liquidity see note 11 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

as of december 31 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents of 323 million of which approximately 312 million or 97 was located outside of the us as of december 31 2014 there were certain foreign government regulations restricting transfers on less than 40 million of the cash located outside of the us as of december 31 2014 our us cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to us borrowers were sufficient to fund our us operating requirements and capital expenditures current debt obligations and dividends the company does not expect that in the near term cash located outside of the us will be needed to satisfy its obligations dividends and other demands for cash in its us operations in connection with the funding of the settlement agreement in 2014 we repatriated cash from our international operations and incurred minimal cash taxes and no significant tax expense 

material commitments and contingencies 

settlement agreement and related costs 

we recorded a pretax charge of 850 million in 2002 of which 513 million represented a cash payment that was due upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of w r grace  co 

on february 3 2014 upon grace’s emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization the settlement agreement was implemented and our subsidiary cryovac inc made the payments contemplated by the settlement agreement consisting of aggregate cash payments in the amount of 930 million to the pi trust and the pd trust and the transfer of 18 million shares of sealed air common stock the “settlement shares” to the pi trust in each case reflecting adjustments made in accordance with the settlement agreement 

on february 3 2014 we funded the cash portion of the settlement payment by using 555 million of accumulated cash and cash equivalents and utilized borrowings of 260 million from our revolving credit facility and 115 million from our accounts receivable securitization programs see “principal sources of liquidity” below the cash payment of 513 million accrued interest at a 55 annual rate which was compounded annually from december 21 2002 to the february 3 2014 date of payment this accrued interest was 413 million at december 31 2013 and is recorded in settlement agreement and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheet the total liability on our consolidated balance sheet was 925 million at december 31 2013 in addition the settlement agreement provided for the issuance of the 18 million settlement shares since the impact of issuing the settlement shares was dilutive to our eps under us gaap they were included in our diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in our calculation of eps to the extent that the impact of including these shares were dilutive see note 21 “net earnings loss per common share” for details of our calculation of eps 

we are deducting the payment mentioned above in our 2014 consolidated us income tax return as a result we have a net operating loss for us tax purposes in 2014 and are carrying back for 10 years more than 1 billion of the loss tax benefits resulting from the settlement agreement were recorded as a 247 million income tax receivable including 38 million of additional paid in capital related to shares of common stock issued pursuant to the settlement agreement and net deferred tax assets of 144 million for us federal net operating losses and 31 million for state net operating loss carry forwards the increase to additional paidin capital on our consolidated balance sheet had no impact to our consolidated statements of operations 

if we are unable to generate sufficient us taxable income we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset and we may not realize the full cash tax benefit relating to this asset this could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods in which these conditions occur changes in statutory tax rates or other new legislation or regulation may also change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an increase to the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset related to the settlement agreement which resulted in an increase of approximately 50 million to our income tax provision approximately 023 per diluted share

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2014 and future years 

 



 













current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt  — represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period 

operating leases — the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under noncancelable real and personal property leases as of december 31 2014 

other principal contractual obligations  — other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy in the normal course of business these obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase the amounts included in the table above represent estimates of the minimum amounts we are obligated to pay or reasonably likely to pay under these agreements we may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and as a result use additional cash 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2014 we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 217 million most of which is included in other liabilities and the remaining balance is included as a reduction to deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2014 we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities see note 16 “income taxes” for further discussion

offbalance sheet arrangements

income tax payments 

we currently expect to pay between 100 million and 120 million of income taxes in 2015 

contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our us and our nonus employees we currently expect our contributions to these plans to be approximately 23 million in 2015 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures

changes in working capital 

 



 

the 202 million or 27 increase in working capital in the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily due to cash flow from operations 38 million of excess tax benefit related to the 18 million shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the settlement agreement and reclassification of 27 million from property plant and equipment to assets held for sale which primarily related to agreement for purchase and sale relating to our building located in racine wisconsin see note 9 “restructuring and relocation activities” for further details

changes in stockholders’ equity 

the 254 million or 18 decrease in stockholders’ equity in 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to









partially offset by 







in the fourth quarter of 2014 we recorded an excess tax benefit of 38 million related to the settlement agreement resulting from an increase in the price of the company’s common stock related to the 18 million shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the settlement agreement in 2002 until its settlement on february 3 2014 the tax benefit was recorded to additional paidin capital on our consolidated balance sheet and did not impact net earnings

the company repurchased approximately 54 million shares of its common stock in 2014 for 184 million at an average price of 34 per share this includes approximately 15 million shares purchased under 10b51 share trading plans for 54 million at an average price of 36 per share and approximately 39 million shares for 130 million at an average price of 33 per share purchased from the wrg asbestos pi trust in the second quarter 2014

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel thirdparty experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of trade receivables as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the likelihood of failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed at a minimum quarterly and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts which is included in selling general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations these changes may reflect changes in economic business and market conditions the allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of chargeoffs net of recoveries 

the provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including but not limited to a regular assessment of the collectability of specific customer balances the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with our customers in circumstances where a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations is known we record a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount we reasonably assess will be collected if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to pay our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount 

fair value measurements of financial instruments 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 







our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for further details on our fair value measurements 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability and we expect to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite–lived intangible assets such as inprocess research and development and trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review other than for inprocess research and development assets we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment — the “component” level — discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2014 and in 2013 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units 

the goodwill impairment test involves a twostep process in step one we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must perform step two of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment we must recognize a noncash impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value 

fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units assumptions for sales net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

income approach used to determine fair values 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis we use a discount rate that reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value longterm growth rates provisions for income taxes future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless debtfree working capital 

2014 annual goodwill impairment test 

critical assumptions that the company used in performing the income approach for its reporting units included the following 



 



 





 



 



changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units our forecasts take into account the near and longterm expected business performance considering the longterm market conditions and business trends within the reporting units for further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions see “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k and our other filings with the sec

market approaches used to determine fair values 

each year we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value 

the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance the “public company method” these multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the company the “quoted price method” the third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publiclytraded and privatelyheld companies in our industries the “mergers and acquisition method” 

the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include trailing and future 12month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied under the public company and the quoted price methods a control premium or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units we also compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions if the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates andor other assumptions 

for the fourth quarter 2012 interim goodwill impairment review and the 2013 and 2014 annual goodwill impairment review of the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units we evaluated each of the above market approaches and determined that the public company and quoted price methods provided the most reliable measures of fair value because they were deemed to be a reliable proxy for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units we applied a combined weighting of 20 to the two market approaches when determining the fair value of each of the reporting units for the 2013 and 2014 annual goodwill impairment review of the packaging solutions product care and medical applications reporting units we also evaluated each of the above market approaches and determined that the public company the quoted price and the mergers and acquisition methods provided the most reliable measures of fair value because they were deemed to be a reliable proxy for these reporting units we applied a combined weighting of 20 to the three market approaches when determining the fair value of these reporting units 

if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change such as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock a decline in current market multiples a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates an adverse action or assessment by a regulator heightened competition strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair values of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount ranging from approximately 30 to approximately 699 of the carrying amounts we will continue to monitor goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in management’s business strategy or significant declines in our stock price indicate that there may be potential indicator of impairment 

see note 7 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2014 2013 and 2012 and other related information 

pensions 

for a number of our us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 for all material plans november 30 for nonmaterial plans 

at december 31 2014 the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans was 221 million and the total benefit income for the year ended december 31 2014 was 1 million at december 31 2014 the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 11 billion and the total benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2014 was 17 million 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2014 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31 2015 in millions 

 



 



 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carry forwards and foreign tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 16 “income taxes” for further discussion

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

at december 31 2014 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps and no outstanding interest rate collars or options

the information set forth in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 113 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2014 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

venezuela 

economic and political events in venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy under us gaap and the us dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela accordingly all bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured into us dollars using the then current exchange rate available to us and any changes in the exchange rate were reflected in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our venezuelan subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of operations

on february 8 2013 the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar exchange rate from 43 bolivars to the us dollar to 63 bolivars to the us dollar we used this official exchange rate of 63 bolivars to the us dollar to remeasure the bolivardenominated assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiaries for us gaap financial statement presentation as of december 31 2013 as a result of the changes in the exchange rates we recognized a pretax loss of 13 million in 2013 due to the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiaries’ financial statements and the impact due to the settlement of bolivardenominated transactions

on march 18 2013 the venezuelan government announced the creation of an alternative foreign currency mechanism called the supplementary foreign currency administration system known as the sicad during december 2013 the venezuelan government issued a new rule allowing the central bank to publish the average sicad rate previously it was prohibited by law to publish any rate different from the official exchange rate which was 113 bolivars per us dollar as stated above at december 31 2013 we remeasured our venezuelan subsidiaries financial statements using the official exchange rate of 63 bolivars to the us dollar since we were not eligible to use the sicad rate at that time

in january 2014 the government expanded the use of sicad and created a new agency called the national center of foreign commerce or cencoex which replaced the commission for the administration of foreign exchange or “cadivi”

in february 2014 the government opened a new exchange control mechanism called sicad 2 which would allow for more exchanges of us dollars and allow more companies the ability to obtain us dollars including for dividend remittances this market began to operate on march 24 2014

therefore there were four legal mechanisms to exchange bolivars for us dollars depending on each company’s facts and circumstances









during 2014 we evaluated which legal mechanisms were available to each venezuelan subsidiary to access us dollars and also estimated the excess cash position over the next 18 months we concluded that as of december 31 2014 the excess cash position for our venezuelan subsidiaries would be remeasured at the sicad 2 rate which was 499883 at december 31 2014 since that would be the only mechanism available to access us dollars to be able to make a dividend payment for the remaining bolivar

denominated cash balances and all other bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities we determined that since we still had access to and were receiving us dollars via the cencoex official rate of 63 we continued to remeasure these items at that rate as of december 31 2014 for any us dollar denominated monetary asset or liability such amounts do not get remeasured at monthend since it is already an asset or liability denominated in us dollars however such amounts were considered and included in the excess cash analysis and an evaluation of the applicable exchange mechanism such amounts could be obtained or settled at was considered as a result of this evaluation the company reported a remeasurement loss of 20 million in 2014 we will continue to evaluate each reporting period the appropriate exchange rate to remeasure our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances at that time

for the year ended december 31 2014 about 1 of our consolidated net sales and operating income were derived from our businesses in venezuela as of december 31 2014 we had net assets of 35 million in venezuela which primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 20 million also as of december 31 2014 our venezuelan subsidiaries had a negative cumulative translation adjustment balance of 46 million

in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced a new foreign exchange platform called the marginal currency system or simadi the simadi will replace the sicad 2 rate as noted above when this market opened on february 12 2015 the rate was 1700390 the sicad 1 auction process noted above will continue to hold periodic auctions for specific sectors of the economy the opening rate is expected to be 12 for the sicad 1 in addition the cencoex will continue and provide preferential treatment for certain import operations such as food and medicines 

the ongoing impact of the recent announcements and our ability to restore net sales and profit to levels achieved prior to the recent devaluations will be impacted by several factors these include our ability to access the various legal mechanisms to exchange bolivars for us dollars including the new simadi platform any potential future devaluation of the exchange rates any further venezuelan government price or exchange controls economic conditions and the availability of raw materials and utilities in addition depending on the future availability of us dollars at the cencoex rate our local us dollar needs our overall repatriation plans including our ability to obtain government approval for the payment of dividends which has been limited in recent years the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors and our ability to collect amounts due from customers and the government including vat receivables we may have exposure for our local monetary assets we continue to evaluate the impact these recent changes will have on our consolidated financial statements which could be material

argentina

recent economic events in argentina including the default on some of its international debt obligations have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risks however as of december 31 2014 we do not anticipate these events will have a material impact to our 2015 outlook discussed above for 2014 about 2 of our consolidated net sales and operating income were derived from our businesses in argentina as of december 31 2014 we had net assets of 22 million including 1 million of cash and cash equivalents in argentina

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2014 would have caused us to pay approximately 97 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in part ii item 8 and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to certain financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2014 we had no foreign exchange options outstanding 

interest rate and currency swap

in connection with exercising the 100 million delayed draw under the senior secured credit facility we entered into a series of interest rate and currency swaps these swaps convert the us dollar denominated variable rate obligation under the credit facility into a fixed rate brazilian real denominated obligation the delayed draw and the interest rate and currency swaps are used to fund expansion and general corporate purposes of our brazilian subsidiaries

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 500 million at december 31 2014 and 398 million at december 31 2013 

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 8 million in 2014 12 million in 2013 and 14 million in 2012 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 29 million at december 31 2014 and 31 million at december 31 2013 

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2014 we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately 9 million in 2015 see note 14 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

 the size and scale of our global operations affords us a continuing opportunity to derive greater supply chain efficiencies by leveraging our purchasing power optimizing our manufacturing and logistics footprint improving our internal processes and reducing complexity and cost in addition to reducing the cost of our supply chain operations we continue to focus on adapting the cost structure of our customer facing and backoffice operations to the appropriate level required to adequately support our external customer base and run the business effectively 

 

 we recognize that a core strength of our business is our people therefore we will continue to invest in the development of key skills in our diverse workforce while improving our ability to attract and retain new employees who are motivated by our company vision and the positive impact they have on the world 

segments 

our segment reporting corresponds with management’s current approach of allocating resources and assessing the performance of our segments our segments are aligned with groups of similar products 

in the third quarter of 2013 we renamed our global business divisions under our segment reporting structure which did not have any impact to the reportable segment results the following are the changes to the names of our three global business divisions

we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2013 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

seasonality 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our diversey care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter second quarter sales represent a modest seasonal increase due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging and the third and fourth quarters of the year are relatively the same level as the second quarter net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price there are also other companies producing competing products that are wellestablished since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership we invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year as compared with our packaging peers 

there are other manufacturers of food care products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the united states 

  

our food care hygiene solutions and diversey care solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach we compete globally on premium product offerings and application expertise innovative product and dispensing equipment offerings valueadded solution delivery and strong customer service and support we differentiate our offerings from competitors by becoming the preferred partner to our customers and by providing innovative industryleading products to make their facilities safer and healthier for both maintenance staff and building occupants we believe our integrated solutions approach which includes the supply of machines tools chemicals processes and training to customers to drive productivity improvements reduce risk of food safety events and improve infection control to reduce healthcare acquired infections is a unique competitive strength additionally the quality ease of use and environmental profile of our products are unique and have helped support longstanding profitable relationships with many top customers 

our product care products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts and wood blocking and bracing systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products 

competition for most of our medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price 

raw materials and sourcing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components equipment accessories and contract manufactured goods our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants chelates fragrances and paper and wood pulp products these raw materials represent approximately 40 of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials baginthebox containers bottles drums pails totes aerosol cans caps triggers valves and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment dilutioncontrol warewashing and laundry equipment floor care machines and items used in the maintenance of a facility such as air care dispensers floor care applicators microfiber mops and cloths buckets carts and other cleaning tools and utensils 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we source some materials used in our 

  

packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global sourcing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of procurement and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve sourcing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent sourcing practices 

research and development activities 

we maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and improve our existing products and processes including developing new packaging nonpackaging and chemical equipment and applications using our intellectual property from time to time we also acquire and commercialize new packaging and other products or techniques developed by others our research and development projects rely on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science chemistry package design and equipment engineering our research and development expense was 133 million in 2013 135 million in 2012 and 105 million in 2011 

our research and development activities are focused on enduse application as a result we operate 

 

  

  

 patents and trademarks 

we are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over 4900 united states and foreign patents and patent applications as well as an aggregate of over 10300 united states and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage we file annually an average of 320 united states and foreign patent applications and 480 united states and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

  

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials in addition customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that incorporate renewable materials or that are otherwise viewed as being “environmentally sound” our new venture activities described above include the development of packaging products from renewable resources we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations to monitor their evolution and to meet this customer demand one advantage inherent in many of our products is that thin lightweight packaging solutions reduce waste and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives we continue to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they become available 

various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements in the united states we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the us environmental protection agency “epa” we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the united states these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we also support our customers’ interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of our products or product packaging and for materials used in some of our products when possible materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in our product care operations or offered to other manufacturers for use in other products in addition gains that we have made in internal recycling programs have allowed us to improve our net raw material yield thus mitigating the impact of resin costs while lowering solid waste disposal costs and controlling environmental liability risks associated with waste disposal 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees

 item 1a risk factors 

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

  

uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

uncertain global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example global economic downturns have adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers hotels restaurants retail establishments other retailers business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in 63 countries and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the united states and a majority of our net sales are generated outside of the united states operations outside of the united states particularly operations in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

although the settlement agreement as defined in note 18 “commitments and contingencies” has been implemented and we have been released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace as defined below if the courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan as defined below and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we are also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 sealed air completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities since the beginning of 2000 we have been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction we are responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries while they vary these suits all appear to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability on april 2 2001 grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders dated may 3 2001 and january 22 2002 staying all asbestos actions against the company the “preliminary injunction” however the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” received the court’s permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction this proceeding was brought in the us district court for the district of delaware the “district court” adv no 0202210 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates in connection with the cryovac transaction the settlement agreement provided for the resolution of the fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction the parties to the agreement in principle signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court signed an order approving the settlement agreement although grace is not a party to the settlement agreement under the terms of the order grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions 

on september 19 2008 grace the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the asbestos pi future claimants’ representative and the official committee of equity security holders filed as coproponents a plan of reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the “plan” and several exhibits and associated documents including a disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court the plan provides for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the united states bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated personal injury and property damage claims are channeled the plan incorporates the settlement agreement including our payment of amounts contemplated by the settlement agreement and the releases and injunctions contemplated by the settlement agreement 

  

on february 3 2014 the “effective date” the plan implementing the settlement agreement became effective with grace emerging from bankruptcy in accordance with the plan and the settlement agreement on the effective date cryovac inc made aggregate cash payments in the amount of 9297 million to the wrg asbestos pi trust the “pi trust” and the wrg asbestos pd trust the “pd trust” and transferred 18 million shares of sealed air common stock to the pi trust in each case reflecting adjustments made in accordance with the settlement agreement under the plan the preliminary injunction remained in place through the effective date and on the effective date the plan and settlement agreement injunctions and releases with respect to asbestos claims and certain other claims became effective thereafter on february 19 2014 grace filed a motion with the bankruptcy court indicating that the preliminary injunction had been replaced by the plan injunctions as of the effective date and seeking to dismiss with prejudice the proceedings in which the preliminary injunction was issued the plan further provides for the channeling of existing and future asbestos claims to the pi trust or the pd trust as applicable in addition under the plan and the settlement agreement grace is required to indemnify us with respect to asbestos and certain other liabilities notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if any courts were to refuse to enforce the injunctions or releases contained in the plan and the settlement agreement with respect to any claims and if in addition grace were unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us for such claims then we could be required to pay substantial damages which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

since november 2004 the company and specified subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of grace’s alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos containing products in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace has agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by grace has been approved by the canadian court and the plan provides for payment of these claims we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us became operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in grace’s united states chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code as indicated above the bankruptcy court entered the bankruptcy court confirmation order on january 31 2011 and the clarifying order on february 15 2011 and the district court entered the original district court confirmation order on january 30 2012 and the amended district court confirmation order on june 11 2012 the canadian court issued an order on april 8 2011 recognizing and giving full effect to the bankruptcy court’s confirmation order in all provinces and territories of canada in accordance with the bankruptcy court confirmation order’s terms as described above the plan became effective on february 3 2014 in accordance with an order of the canadian court on the effective date the actions became permanently stayed until they are amended to remove the grace parties as named defendants two actions were dismissed by the manitoba court as against the grace parties on february 19 2014 and it is anticipated that the remaining actions will now also be dismissed notwithstanding the foregoing and although we believe the possibility to be remote if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay substantial damages which we cannot estimate at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations for further information concerning these matters see note 18 “commitments and contingencies” 

as a result of the recent funding of the settlement agreement a large portion of our common stock was transferred to the pi trust future sales of our common stock by the pi trust could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

as of february 3 2014 the pi trust owned approximately 84 of our outstanding common stock as a result of the transfer of 18 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the settlement agreement in connection with the settlement agreement we entered into a registration rights agreement with the pi trust with respect to these 

  

shares the registration rights agreement which includes customary “piggyback” and shelf registration provisions requires us to file a registration statement for the resale of the shares of our common stock transferred to the pi trust and to cooperate in certain underwritten offerings sales by the pi trust of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market pursuant to registration rights or otherwise or the perception that these sales might occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization programs restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indenture governing certain of our senior notes these notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

  

the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization programs and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 

  

  

  

 in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization programs can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even 

  

though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2013 we had 1393 billion of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 09 million increase or a 09 million decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical based raw materials and energy could increase our costs in addition the prices of many of the other key raw materials used in our businesses such as caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants polymers and resins chelates and fragrances are cyclical based on numerous supply and demand factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets including primarily those related to the settlement agreement may be affected by a number of factors including our earnings in the us 

we have deferred tax assets related to the settlement agreement other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes foreign tax credits us and foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize these assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

our largest deferred tax asset relates to our settlement agreement the value of this net asset which was 373 million at december 31 2013 reflects our anticipated tax benefit from the cash portion of the settlement agreement and related accrued interest and the value of 18 million shares of our common stock at a postsplit price of 1786 per share which was the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 we intend to carry back a significant portion of the loss resulting from our deduction under the settlement agreement the efficiency of any amount carried back and the benefit there from as well as the benefit from the amount carried forward may depend upon among other factors our past and anticipated future earnings in the us these factors including any reduction in our anticipated us earnings could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods 

  

in which any such condition occurs in addition changes in statutory tax rates or other legislation or regulation may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate 

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as “mad cow” disease footandmouth disease and avian influenza or “birdflu” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products in recent years occasional cases of “mad cow” disease have been confirmed and incidents of birdflu have surfaced in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in the food processing and food service industries consumer preferences for food and packaging formats of prepackaged food can influence our sales as can consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods changes in consumer behavior including changes in consumer preferences driven by various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

customers in the food service food and beverage processing building care lodging industrial distribution and healthcare sectors have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

the market for our hygiene products is highly competitive our hygiene products businesses face significant competition from global national regional and local companies within some or all of our product lines in each sector that we serve barriers to entry and expansion in the institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene industry are low 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products additionally we may not successfully implement our pricing actions these factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

concerns about greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials and freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits it is also possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization programs we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes our accounts receivable securitization programs and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

strengthening of the us dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 65 of our net sales in 2013 were generated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 

also while we often produce in the same geographic markets as our products are sold expenses are more concentrated in the us than sales so that in a time of strengthening of the us dollar our profit margins could be reduced while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 13 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — foreign exchange rates — venezuela” 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens and a more stringent manner in which they are applied particularly in the united states could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole for 

  

example the affordable care act the “aca” which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years significantly affects the provision of both healthcare services and benefits in the united states the aca may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business we provide benefits to our employees which are competitive within the industries in which we operate the aca did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations in 2013 2012 or 2011 however we are continuing to assess the impact of the aca on our healthcare benefit costs the regulatory environment is still developing and the potential exists for future legislation and regulations to be adopted these developments as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate income tax provision changes in statutory tax rates and laws as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us for example legislative proposals to change us taxation of nonus earnings could increase our effective tax rate also changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate in addition our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure we are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies adverse developments in these laws or regulations or any change in position regarding the application administration or interpretation thereof in any applicable jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations in addition the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the united states may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations 

our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

  

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and third party information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations 

we also seek opportunities to enhance our enterprise reporting systems “erps” and are currently in the process of implementing upgrades and new erps as a result of these implementations we may experience disruptions in fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and data processing and electronic communications among business locations which may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets as a result of the acquisition of diversey and we may never realize the full carrying value of these assets 

as a result of the acquisition of diversey we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment may result from among other things i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessment by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we recorded impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in 2012 see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for further discussion 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions 

  

could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

the relationship with sc johnson  son inc “scj” is important to our diversey care segment and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on this segment 

diversey is party to various agreements with scj including a brand license agreement the “bla” a technology disclosure and license agreement and supply and manufacturing agreements under the bla diversey is granted a license in specified territories to sell certain scj products and use specified trade names owned by scj in the institutional and industrial channels of trade and subject to certain limitations in specified channels of trade in which both our diversey care segment and scj’s consumer business operate scj and its affiliates supply products under the bla sales of these products have historically been significant to our diversey care segment the bla purports to limit diversey’s right to market products with nonscj brands that scj has not approved in certain channels of trade in specified countries if we default under our agreements with scj and the agreements are terminated scj fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with scj is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our diversey care segment consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the relationship with unilever plc “unilever” is important to our diversey care segment and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on this segment 

in connection with diversey’s acquisition of the diverseylever business from unilever in 2002 diversey entered into various agreements with unilever including a license agreement and agency agreement pursuant to the license agreement unilever granted 31 diversey subsidiaries a license to produce and sell professional size packs of unilever’s consumer brand cleaning products in four countries the united kingdom ireland portugal and brazil the diversey subsidiaries operate under an agency agreement with unilever in addition diversey also holds licenses to use some trademarks and technology of unilever in the market for institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene products and related services we believe that these agreements are significant to our diversey care segment if we default under our agreements with unilever and the agreements are terminated unilever fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with unilever is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our diversey care segment consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies if any of our senior management or other key personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business 

  

we are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water and the use handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our european operations as a result of a european union “eu” directive “registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals” eu directive no 20061907 enacted on december 18 2006 the directive imposes several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical substances manufactured or marketed in europe the eu has also recently enacted a “classification packaging and labeling” regulation other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the legacy diversey business had tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever pursuant to the unilever acquisition agreement as defined below 

under a previous acquisition agreement between the legacy diversey business and unilever the “unilever acquisition agreement” unilever made warranties to diversey with respect to the facilities formerly owned by unilever in addition unilever agreed to indemnify diversey for specified types of environmental liabilities if the aggregate amount of damages meets various dollar thresholds subject to a cap of 250 million in the aggregate diversey was required to notify unilever of any environmental indemnification claims by may 3 2008 any environmental claims pending after this date with respect to which diversey has notified unilever remain subject to indemnification until remediation is completed in accordance with the unilever acquisition agreement 

diversey has previously tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever in connection with former unilever locations unilever has not indicated its agreement with diversey’s request for indemnification we may file additional requests for reimbursement in the future in connection with pending indemnification claims however there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover any amounts relating to these indemnification claims from unilever 

  

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products this loss of a competitive advantage could result in decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the united states and in other countries where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to an increasing number of information technology vulnerabilities threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to mitigate these risks our systems networks products solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats 

we also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls despite our efforts to protect such sensitive confidential or personal data or information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

we manufacture products in 122 facilities with 35 of those facilities serving more than one of our business segments and our other category of products the geographic dispersion of our manufacturing facilities is as follows 

 

 manufacturing facilities by reportable segment and other 

food care we produce food care products in 60 manufacturing facilities of which 15 are in north america 16 in europe 11 in latin america 11 in amat and 7 in janz 

diversey care we produce diversey care products in 20 manufacturing facilities of which 5 are in north america 5 in europe 3 in latin america 5 in amat and 2 in janz 

product care we produce product care products in 73 manufacturing facilities of which 36 are in north america 17 in europe 7 in latin america 10 in amat and 3 in janz 

  

other we produce medical applications products in 3 manufacturing facilities of which 1 is in north america and 2 are in europe we produce other products in 3 manufacturing facilities of which 2 are in north america and 1 is in europe 

other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the us and in many foreign countries some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some on those that we lease standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters are located in a leased property in elmwood park new jersey for a list of those countries outside of the united states where we have operations see “global operations” above 

we believe that our manufacturing warehouse office and other facilities are well maintained suitable for their purposes and adequate for our needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

the information set forth in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k in note 18 “commitments and contingencies” under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2013 we were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “superfund” sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2013 environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the information in this mda should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in part ii item 8 as well as the discussion included in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k all amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions except per share amounts 

the results include the operating results of diversey beginning october 3 2011 date of acquisition all results prior to october 3 2011 include historical sealed air results only 

on december 6 2013 we completed the sale of the rigid medical packaging business and accordingly the operating results were reclassified to discontinued operations net of tax on the consolidated statements of operations for 2013 2012 and 2011 on november 14 2012 we completed the sale of diversey japan and accordingly the operating results were reclassified to discontinued operations net of tax on the consolidated statements of operations for 2012 and 2011 also the assets and liabilities of the rigid medical packaging business operations were reclassified to assets and liabilities held for sale as of december 31 2012 see note 3 “divestitures” for further details all results and discussion included in this mda are presented on a continuing operations basis 

in the third quarter of 2013 we renamed our global business divisions under our segment reporting structure which did not have any impact to the reportable segment results the following are the changes to the names of our three global business divisions 

 

  

  

 we also have an other category which includes our medical applications and new ventures businesses the changes to the segment names had no effect on our historical consolidated results of operations see note 5 “segments” for further details of our segment structure 

overview 

we are a global leader in food safety and security facility hygiene and product protection we serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing food service retail healthcare and industrial and commercial and consumer applications we have widely recognized and inventive brands such as bubble wrap ® brand cushioning cryovac ® brand food packaging solutions and diversey ® brand cleaning and hygiene 

  

solutions our focus is on achieving quality sales growth through leveraging our geographic footprint technological knowhow and leading market positions to bring measureable sustainable value to our customers employees and investors 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 7300 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies healthcare facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2013 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

historically net sales in our food care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our diversey care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter second quarter sales represent a modest seasonal increase due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging and the third and fourth quarters of the year are relatively the same level as the second quarter net sales in our product care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to holiday events on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and as a result we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership our food care hygiene solutions and diversey care solutions businesses face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach for more details see “competition” included in part i item 1 “business” 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders 

2014 outlook 

we expect net sales to be relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013 net sales of 77 billion with organic growth of approximately 3 to 4 due to positive trends in volume and product pricemix this is expected to be offset 

  

by the impact of product rationalization of approximately 1 to 2 and an estimated unfavorable impact of more than 2 from foreign currency translation adjusted eps excluding the impact of stock appreciation rights “sars” expense is expected to be in the range of 150 to 160 this represents an estimated increase of 8 to 15 compared with 2013 adjusted eps of 139 excluding sars expense adjusted eps guidance excludes the impact of special items our core tax rate for 2014 is expected to be approximately 25 we also estimate interest expense to be approximately 295 million 280 million of cash interest expense and depreciation and amortization to be approximately 315 million 

adjusted ebitda for 2014 including noncash profit sharing expense and excluding the impact of sars is estimated to be in the range of 1050 billion to 1070 billion this represents an estimated increase of 1 to 3 compared with 2013 adjusted ebitda of 1038 billion 

for 2014 we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 170 million cash payments related to the earnings quality improvement program “eqip” and the integration and optimization program “iop” of approximately 150 million and cash taxes between 100 million and 120 million as a result of higher capital expenditures and restructuring payments in 2014 as compared to 2013 we anticipate free cash flow for 2014 to be approximately 410 million

foreign currency translation impact on consolidated financial results 

since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated financial results into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our financial results from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact historically the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro the australian dollar the brazilian real the british pound the canadian dollar and the mexican peso 

as shown below 65 of our consolidated net sales in 2013 were generated outside the us 

the following table presents the approximate favorable or unfavorable impact foreign currency translation had on some of our consolidated financial results 

 

 net sales by geographic region 

net sales by geographic region for three years ended december 31 2013 as follows 

 

  

     

by geographic region the components of the increase in net sales for 2013 compared with 2012 were as follows 

 

  

   by geographic region the components of the increase in net sales for 2012 compared with 2011 were as follows 

 

  

     

net sales by segment reporting structure 

the following table presents net sales by our segment reporting structure 

 

  

 components of change in net sales by segment reporting structure 

the following tables present the components of change in net sales by our segment reporting structure for 2013 compared with 2012 and 2012 compared with 2011 we also present the change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation a nonus gaap measure which we define as “constant dollar” we believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability between periods as it eliminates the volatility of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

   

  

  the following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis 

food care segment net sales 

2013 compared with 2012 

the 124 million or 3 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to 

 

  

 2012 compared with 2011 

the 590 million or 18 constant dollar increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

   

diversey care segment net sales 

2013 compared with 2012 

the 44 million or 2 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these favorable factors were offset by 

 

 2012 compared with 2011 

the 1610 million constant dollar increase in net sales in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to 

 

  

 these factors were partially offset by a decrease in unit volumes in europe of 10 million or 4 reflecting a decline in consumer brands and lower equipment sales 

product care segment net sales 

2013 compared with 2012 

the 38 million or 2 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to 

 

  

 these favorable factors were offset by 

 

 2012 compared with 2011 

the 20 million or 1 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to higher unit volumes in the us of 25 million or 3 due to expanded market presence and strengths in solutions targeting ecommerce applications this growth was partially offset by lower unit volumes in europe of 11 million or 3 primarily due to lower customer demand reflecting the current economic challenges in the region 

  

cost of sales 

cost of sales for the three years ended december 31 2013 was as follows 

 

 2013 compared with 2012 

cost of sales was impacted by a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 62 million on a constant dollar basis cost of sales increased 128 million or 3 some of the factors that contributed to the increase in cost of sales were 

 

  

  

  

  

 these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of 

 

  

 cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased in the last three years primarily reflecting manufacturing efficiency improvements and synergies from our restructuring programs 

we anticipate raw material costs will have an unfavorable impact on cost of sales in 2014 as compared with 2013 we have historically implemented and will continue to implement pricing actions as appropriate to offset increases in raw material costs along with increases in other input costs we may experience 

2012 compared with 2011 

the 12 billion increase in cost of sales in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the incremental impact of costs of sales from acquired businesses of 12 billion from the food care hygiene solutions and diversey care businesses as a result of the acquisition of diversey in the fourth quarter of 2011 cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with 2011 was also impacted by a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 111 million costs for raw materials and freight were 15 million lower in 2012 compared with 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses for the three years ended december 31 2013 are included in the table below 

 

   

2013 compared with 2012 

selling general and administrative expenses were impacted by a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 9 million on a constant dollar basis selling general and administrative expenses increased 2 million primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost synergies associated with iop of 68 million 

2012 compared with 2011 

the 752 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to a 796 million incremental impact of expenses from acquired businesses from the food care hygiene solutions and diversey care businesses as a result of the acquisition of diversey in the fourth quarter of 2011 partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 27 million and a decrease in sharebased compensation of 8 million primarily because we did not achieve some of our 2012 financial performance goals 

amortization expense of intangible assets acquired 

amortization expense of intangible assets acquired for the three years ended december 31 2013 was as follows 

 

 the decrease in amortization expense in 2013 as compared with 2012 was primarily due to the impact of the noncash impairment charge recorded in 2012 which lowered the carrying value of certain intangible assets acquired which in turn resulted in lower amortization expense in 2013 the increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of diversey in the fourth quarter of 2011 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

during the third quarter of 2012 due to the continuing unfavorable economic conditions primarily in europe and north america we reevaluated the near and longterm expected business performance of our diversey business our diversey business had experienced operating results that were significantly lower than expected during the first half of 2012 and lower than originally forecasted at the time of the acquisition of diversey in 2011 also during the third quarter of 2012 we started our annual multiyear strategic forecasting and planning process which is prepared for all reporting units in the second half of each year in connection with this process we reevaluated the near and longterm expected business performance of the diversey business and considered the longterm market conditions and business trends within each of the diversey regional reporting units as a result of our reevaluation we determined that our european business was not expected to achieve any significant growth until late 2013 or 2014 additionally in north america we were not able to pass along to our customers increases in raw material costs that began in late 2011 and continued into 2012 consequently causing margins to be significantly lower than originally expected also the impact of lower sales and increases in raw material costs in latin america caused that region’s operating results to be lower than expected when we factored the impact of these unfavorable conditions into our strategic forecasting and planning process we determined that 

  

these were significant indicators of potential impairment in accordance with asc 350 “intangiblesgoodwill and other” accordingly we performed an interim impairment test for both the goodwill and longlived assets of the diversey european north american and latin american reporting units 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we began to operate under our new business division structure which created the diversey care and hygiene solutions which is included in the food care segment reporting units from the previous legacy diversey segment in connection with this new business division structure we revised our multiyear forecast under the new reporting unit structure 

included in the revised multiyear forecast was our expectation that there would be further economic weakness in europe particularly in southern europe which was more severe than we initially forecasted during our third quarter 2012 interim impairment review the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units both derive a significant portion of their revenue from europe also included in the revised multiyear forecast for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units were the reported results for these reporting units for the fourth quarter of 2012 the reported results for both the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units were lower than originally forecasted at the end of the third quarter of 2012 in particular the diversey care reporting unit experienced lower volumes in its consumer brands and lower equipment sales in europe as compared with the fourth quarter of 2011 in addition the diversey care reporting unit continued to incur higher sales and marketing expenses compared with the fourth quarter of 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2012 several new members of our senior management team believed that a new and enhanced business strategy was required to successfully operate both the diversey care and hygiene solutions businesses the combination of the factors mentioned above unfavorably impacted our near and longterm forecasted revenues and cash flows for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units 

at december 31 2012 we considered the factors mentioned above including our new business division structure and we determined that further indicators of impairment were present accordingly we performed an interim assessment of impairment of our goodwill and longlived assets for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units 

in 2012 we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 18923 million of goodwill and other intangible assets 

during 2013 the profitability and operating performance of the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units showed improvement over the prior year profitability and operating performance this operating performance improvement was factored into our annual multiyear strategic forecasting and planning process which is prepared for all reporting units in the second half of each year in connection with this process we evaluated the near and longterm expected business performance of all the reporting units and considered the longterm market conditions and business trends within each of the reporting units 

included in these longterm forecasts are improved cash flows for the diversey care reporting unit which is being driven by improved sales growth and reduced operating expenses the forecasted longterm sales growth is due to a combination of expected price increases across many of the regions as well as volume growth volume growth is forecasted in the amat region and the north american region is expected to recover with low sales growth in europe the longterm forecasts reflect volume decreases in 2014 due to the continued economic weakness in that region but are expected to show improvement starting in 2015 along with sales growth various activities including existing restructuring programs are expected to result in reduced operating costs and contribute to a stronger cash flow 

the company is also forecasting improved cash flows for the hygiene solutions reporting unit due to improved sales growth primarily being driven from the emerging markets which includes the amat and latin american regions due to a combination of volume growth and expected price increases and to a lesser extent sales growth in north america sales growth is expected to be flat in europe in 2014 but is expected to show improvement starting in 2015 however profitability in europe is expected to improve due to product rationalization and price 

  

mix improvements hygiene solutions is also expecting overall improved profitability for the business resulting from improvements in sales and marketing costs which are expected to contribute to reduced operating costs and overall stronger cash flows 

see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill reviews performed in 2013 and 2012 and other related information 

stock appreciation rights expense 

sars expense for the three years ended december 31 2013 is as follows 

 

 sars expense increased 20 million in 2013 as compared with 2012 sars expense includes the impact of changes in the share price of our common stock the increase of sars expense in 2013 as compared with 2012 was primarily due to the increase in the share price of our common stock of approximately 94 in 2013 as compared with 2012 we continue to explore opportunities to mitigate the impact of the volatility sars expense is having on our consolidated results of operations see note 19 “stockholders’ equity” for further details of our sars program the eps impact of sars expense was 016 per share in 2013 and 007 per share in 2012 

as of december 31 2013 we had 13 million sars outstanding of which 08 million were unvested the 08 million unvested sars vest as follows 05 million in 2014 and the remainder in the first quarter of 2015 based on recent experience we would expect vested sars to be exercised within a few months of their vesting date 

costs related to the acquisition and integration of diversey 

we recorded transaction and integration costs directly related to the acquisition and integration of diversey of 1 million in 2013 7 million in 2012 and 65 million in 2011 the transaction related costs were 55 million in 2011 and primarily consist of financing commitment legal regulatory and appraisal fees the remainder of the costs in all periods were integration costs primarily consisting of consulting fees as discussed above we have excluded these costs from our adjusted eps calculations see note 4 “acquisition of diversey holdings inc” for further discussion of the acquisition 

restructuring activities 

earnings quality improvement program eqip 

as announced on may 1 2013 we commenced with eqip which is an initiative to deliver meaningful cost savings and network optimization the plan is estimated to generate annualized savings of approximately 80 million by the end of 2015 savings for 2013 were minimal see note 10 “restructuring activities” for further discussion of the costs and liabilities associated with this program 

integration and optimization program iop 

in december 2011 we initiated a restructuring program associated with the integration of diversey’s business following our acquisition of diversey on october 3 2011 this program is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 we achieved 112 million of incremental cost synergies in 2013 related to this program compared with 2012 we achieved these synergies in cost of sales 44 million and selling general and administrative expenses 68 million primarily in our food care and diversey care divisions 

  

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to this program are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later than expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending and benefits see note 10 “restructuring activities” for further discussion of the charges and liabilities associated with this program 

operating profit loss 

management evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on its operating profit loss operating profit loss by our segment reporting structure for the three years ended december 31 2013 was as follows 

 

  

   

 see “restructuring activities” above for further discussion of restructuring activities 

food care segment operating profit loss 

2013 compared with 2012 

food care’s operating profit was 431 million in 2013 compared with a 171 million operating loss in 2012 the operating loss in 2012 included a 543 million noncash charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets excluding the 2012 noncash impairment charge operating profit increased 59 million in 2013 this increase was primarily due to the impact of cost synergies associated with iop of 58 million impact of higher volumes of 20 million and favorable productprice mix and manufacturing efficiency improvements of 25 million these factors were partially offset by higher performance based annual incentive compensation of 21 million higher selling general and administrative expenses of 13 million and higher sars expense of 3 million 

  

2012 compared with 2011 

the operating loss in 2012 includes the noncash impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets of 543 million see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for further details excluding the noncash impairment charge operating profit was flat in 2012 as compared with 2011

2012 compared with 2011 

the operating loss in 2012 includes the noncash impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets of 13 billion see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for further details excluding the noncash impairment charge operating profit increased by 62 million in 2012 compared to 2011 which was a result of the increase in net sales described above and lower raw materials costs being partially offset by higher selling general and administrative costs 

product care segment operating profit 

2013 compared with 2012 

product care operating profit declined 3 to 200 million in 2013 from 208 million in 2012 this decline of 8 million was primarily due to unfavorable impact of 14 million primarily related to nonmaterial inflation higher selling general and administrative expenses of 9 million higher performance based annual incentive compensation of 7 million unfavorable productprice mix and manufacturing efficiency improvements of 6 million and a lifo adjustment of 3 million these factors were partially offset by incremental cost synergies associated with iop of 19 million and the impact of higher volumes of 16 million 

2012 compared with 2011 

operating profit remained flat in 2012 as compared with 2011 

interest expense

in november 2012 we amended and refinanced our senior secured credit facility to a reduce term loan b interest rates b gain additional flexibility on the financial covenant and c amend certain other terms as a result we recognized a noncash pretax loss of 16 million for the accelerated unamortized original issuance discount of 9 million and the unamortized capitalized lender fees for 7 million we also recorded new original issuance discount and nonlender fees for a total of 2 million which are included in the carrying amount of the debt instruments in addition we recorded a noncash pretax loss of 7 million of nonlender fees related to the transactions mentioned above 

see note 12 “debt and credit facilities” for details of our debt transactions 

impairment of equity method investments 

in 2013 we recognized an impairment of 2 million in connection with an equity method investment included in our other category this investment was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in september 2007 we established a joint venture that supports our food care segment we account for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of net income or losses included in other expense net on the consolidated statements of operations 

during the first half of 2012 the joint venture performed below expectations resulting in reduced cash flow and increasing debt obligations due to these events we evaluated our equity method investment for impairment during the three months ended june 30 2012 based on reviewing undiscounted cash flow information we determined that the fair value of our investment was less than its carrying value and that this impairment was otherthantemporary 

in connection with the establishment of the joint venture in 2007 we issued a guarantee in support of an uncommitted credit facility agreement that was entered into by the joint venture under the terms of the guarantee if the joint venture were to default under the terms of the credit facility the lender would be entitled to seek payment of the amounts due under the credit facility from us however as a result of the impairment we have included the guarantee liability in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2013 and 2012 as we believe it is probable that we will need to perform under this guarantee as of december 31 2013 the joint venture has performed its obligations under the terms of the credit facility and the debt holders have not requested that we perform under the terms of the guarantee 

as a result in the second quarter of 2012 we recognized otherthantemporary impairment of 26 million 18 million net of taxes or 009 per diluted share this impairment consisted of the recognition of a current 

  

liability for the guarantee of the uncommitted credit facility mentioned above of 20 million and a 4 million writedown of the carrying value of the investment to zero at june 30 2012 we also recorded provisions for bad debt on receivables due from the joint venture to the company of 2 million which is included in selling general and administrative expenses and impacted our food care division we have no additional obligations to support the operations of the joint venture in the future 

foreign currency exchange losses gains related to venezuelan subsidiaries 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy the foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2013 2012 and 2011 for our venezuelan subsidiary were the result of two factors 1 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to settle bolivardenominated transactions and 2 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements at the balance sheet date we believe these gains and losses are attributable to the unstable foreign currency environment in venezuela see “venezuela” in “foreign exchange rates” of item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion on venezuela 

other expense net 

see note 20 “other expense net” for the components and discussion of other expense net 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 473 for 2013 primarily due to our increase of approximately 50 million as a result of not funding the settlement agreement before the end of 2013 the delay in funding required us to increase our valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to the settlement agreement excluding that increase our tax rate would have been approximately 19 our core tax rate for the year was 218 and benefited from earnings in jurisdictions with low tax rates and losses in jurisdictions such as the us with high tax rates as well as various reorganizations and a retroactive reinstatement of certain tax provisions that were recorded as discrete items in 2013 on january 2 2013 the president signed the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 retroactively reinstating and extending the research and development tax credit and certain foreign tax provisions from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 

our loss before income taxes from continuing operations for 2012 was reduced by an income tax benefit of 265 million our effective income tax benefit rate for 2012 was 14 because our net loss resulted from an impairment charge substantially all of which related to nondeductible goodwill with no corresponding tax benefit our core tax rate for the year was 26 our tax provision for the year benefitted from earnings in jurisdictions with low tax rates and losses in jurisdictions such as the us with high tax rates as well as favorable settlements of certain tax disputes totaling 12 million in 2012 the favorable factors were partially offset by losses in jurisdictions where we did not have any tax benefit due to the applicable tax rate or valuation allowances 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 30 for 2011 as described below the legacydiversey operations and the costs of the diversey acquisition increased our 2011 effective tax rate for 2011 our effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings as well as income tax benefits from tax credits and the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state income taxes and in 2011 nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with the diversey acquisition 

we expect a core income tax rate of approximately 25 in 2014 

our effective tax rate also depends on the realization of our deferred tax assets net of our valuation allowances we have deferred tax assets related to the settlement agreement other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes foreign tax credits us and foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances employee benefit items and other items 

  

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carry back any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize these assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reverse those valuation allowances 

our largest deferred tax asset relates to our settlement agreement as described in note 15 “commitments and contingencies” our tax benefit with respect thereto depended upon when we funded the settlement agreement as noted above the delay in funding the settlement agreement until 2014 required us to increase our valuation allowance resulting in an increased tax expense of approximately 50 million in 2013 in addition changes in statutory tax rates or other new legislation or regulation may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate see “material commitments and contingencies” below for further discussion 

see note 17 “income taxes” for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate which also shows the major components of the year over year changes and other tax information 

liquidity and capital resources 

material commitments and contingencies 

settlement agreement and related costs 

we recorded a pretax charge of 850 million in 2002 of which 513 million represented a cash payment that we are required to make subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of w r grace  co we did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability 

on february 3 2014 upon grace’s emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization the settlement agreement was implemented and our subsidiary cryovac inc made the payments contemplated by the settlement agreement consisting of aggregate cash payments in the amount of 930 million to the pi trust and the pd trust and the transfer of 18 million shares of sealed air common stock the “settlement shares” to the pi trust in each case reflecting adjustments made in accordance with the settlement agreement see note 22 “subsequent events” for further details 

on february 3 2014 we funded the cash portion of the settlement payment by using 555 million of accumulated cash and cash equivalents and utilized borrowings of 260 million from our revolving credit facility and 115 million from our accounts receivable securitization programs see “principal sources of liquidity” below the cash payment of 513 million accrued interest at a 55 annual rate which was compounded annually from december 21 2002 to the february 3 2014 date of payment this accrued interest was 413 million at december 31 2013 and is recorded in settlement agreement and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheet the total liability on our consolidated balance sheet was 925 million at december 31 2013 in addition the settlement agreement provided for the issuance of the 18 million settlement shares since the impact of issuing the settlement shares was dilutive to our eps under us gaap they were included in our diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in our calculation of eps to the extent that the impact of including these shares were dilutive see note 21 “net loss earnings per common share” for details of our calculation of eps 

tax benefits resulting from the anticipated funding of the settlement agreement were recorded as a 373 million net deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 this deferred tax asset reflects the cash portion of the settlement agreement and related accrued interest and the value of the 18 million shares of 

  

our common stock at the postsplit price of 1786 per share which was the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 the impact of the increase in share price from 2002 to more than 30 per share on february 3 2014 will be included as an increase to additional paidin capital on our consolidated balance sheet when we realize the cash tax benefit as a result of our higher stock price and will have no impact to our consolidated statements of operations 

we intend to carry back a significant portion of the loss resulting from our deduction under the settlement agreement the efficiency of any amount carried back and the benefit therefrom as well as the benefit from the amount carried forward may depend upon among other factors our past and anticipated future earnings in the us 

if we are unable to generate sufficient us taxable income we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset and we may not realize the full cash tax benefit relating to this asset this could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods in which these conditions occur changes in statutory tax rates or other new legislation or regulation may also change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an increase to the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset related to the settlement agreement which resulted in an increase of approximately 50 million to our income tax provision approximately 023 per diluted share

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2013 and future years 

 

   

 

      current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt  — represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period 

operating leases  — the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under noncancelable real and personal property leases as of december 31 2013 

other principal contractual obligations  — other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy in the normal course of business these obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase the amounts included in the table above represent estimates of the minimum amounts we are obligated to pay or reasonably likely to pay under these agreements we may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and as a result use additional cash 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2013 we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 249 million most of which is included in other liabilities and the remaining balance as a reduction to current deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities see note 17 “income taxes” for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have reviewed our offbalance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

income tax payments 

we currently expect to pay between 100 million and 120 million of income taxes in 2014 

contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our us and our nonus employees we currently expect our contributions to these plans be approximately 30 million in 2014 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a 

  

loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

principal sources of liquidity 

our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our amended credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses restructuring expenses investments in working capital capital expenditures interest taxes dividends debt obligations and other longterm liabilities we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months 

on february 3 2014 we funded the 930 million settlement agreement and accrued interest liability using cash on hand and committed liquidity to fund the cash payment we used 555 million of cash and cash equivalents and utilized borrowings of 260 million from our revolving credit facility and 115 million from our accounts receivable securitization programs see note 22 “subsequent events” for further details also on february 14 2014 we repaid our 12 senior notes on their maturity date with available cash on hand and committed liquidity see note 12 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

as of december 31 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of 992 million of which approximately 540 million or 54 was located outside of the us as of december 31 2013 there were certain foreign government regulations restricting transfers on less than 65 million of the cash located outside of the us as of december 31 2013 our us cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to us borrowers were sufficient to fund our us operating requirements and capital expenditures current debt obligations and dividends the company does not expect that in the near term cash located outside of the us will be needed to satisfy its obligations dividends and other demands for cash in its us operations in connection with the funding of the settlement agreement in 2014 we repatriated cash from our international operations and believe that the repatriation of cash should result in minimal cash taxes and no significant tax expense 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents 

 

 see “analysis of historical cash flows” below 

lines of credit 

there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2013 and 2012 there was 60 million outstanding under various uncommitted lines of credit and 22 million outstanding under various committed lines of credit extended to our international subsidiaries at december 31 2013 and 39 million at december 31 2012 see note 12 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

  

accounts receivable securitization programs 

at december 31 2013 we had 209 million available to us under the programs we did not utilize these programs in 2013 and 2012 see note 9 “accounts receivable securitization programs” for information concerning these programs 

covenants 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations as discussed in “covenants” of note 12 “debt and credit facilities” 

debt ratings 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency 

 

 these credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade if our credit ratings are downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

outstanding indebtedness 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table 

 

 see note 12 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

analysis of historical cash flow 

the following table shows the changes in our consolidated cash flows from continuing operations in the three years ended december 31 2013 

 

   

net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2013 of 625 million was primarily attributable to net earnings adjusted to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities of 511 million which primarily included adjustments for depreciation and amortization sharebased incentive compensation expenses profit sharing expense and loss on debt redemption net changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in net cash provided by operating activities of 114 million in 2013 primarily in trade receivables net inventories and accounts payable in 2013 we reduced our day sales outstanding by three days reduced our inventory days on hand by four days and increased our days payables outstanding by two days 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2012 was primarily attributable to net earnings adjusted to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities of 407 million which primarily included adjustments for depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets sharebased incentive compensation expenses profit sharing expenses impairment of equity method investment and deferred taxes in 2012 our adjustments to reconcile net earnings loss to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations included a 319 million change in net deferred taxes this amount primarily related to the impact of the deferred taxes recorded in connection with the noncash impairment of other intangible assets which is included in adjustments to reconcile net earnings loss to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to offset the impact of the noncash tax benefit that is included in net loss earnings available to common stockholders from continuing operations net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash use of 13 million in 2012 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2011 was primarily attributable to net earnings adjusted to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities of 377 million which primarily included adjustments for depreciation and amortization costs related to the acquisition of diversey and sharebased incentive compensation expenses net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net use of cash of 14 million in 2011 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2013 of 106 million primarily consisted of capital expenditures of 116 million related to capacity expansions to support growth in net sales capital expenditure related to our restructuring programs were 25 million in 2013 

in 2012 we used net cash of 115 million in investing activities which was primarily due to capital expenditures of 123 million 

in 2011 we used net cash of 24 billion in investing activities due to capital expenditures of 122 million and the acquisition of diversey for 22 billion see note 4 “acquisition of diversey holdings inc” for further information 

we expect to continue to invest capital as we deem appropriate to expand our business to maintain or replace depreciating property plant and equipment to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve 

  

productivity and net sales growth we expect total capital expenditures in 2014 to be approximately 170 million which include capital expenditures of 34 million associated with the eqip and iop programs this projection is based upon our capital expenditure budget for 2014 the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects anticipated future projects and historic spending trends 

net cash used in provided by financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

 these factors were partially offset by issuance of 425 million of 525 senior notes due april 2023 and short term borrowings of 53 million 

net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

 partially offset by 

 

  

  

 2011 

net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 partially offset by 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 free cash flow 

in addition to net cash provided by operating activities we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures which is classified as an investing activity free cash flow is not defined under us gaap therefore it should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures including certain debt servicing requirements or nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure we typically generate the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year below find details of free cash flow for three years ended december 31 

 

 changes in working capital 

 

 the 237 million or 25 decrease in working capital in the year ended december 31 2013 was primarily due to 

 

  

 changes in stockholders’ equity 

the 54 million or 4 decrease in stockholders’ equity in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to dividends paid and accrued on our common stock of 103 million and cumulative translation adjustment of 110 million partially offset by net earnings of 124 million and an increase in treasury stock of 26 million primarily due to the transfer of common stock from treasury stock as part of our 2012 profit sharing plan contribution made in 2013

for further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel thirdparty experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of trade receivable as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to 

  

make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts which is included in selling general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations these changes may reflect changes in economic business and market conditions the allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of chargeoffs net of recoveries 

the provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including but not limited to a regular assessment of the collectability of specific customer balances the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with our customers in circumstances where a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations is known we record a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount we reasonably assess will be collected if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to pay our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount 

fair value measurements of financial instruments 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 

 

  

  

 our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 14 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for further details on our fair value measurements 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability and we expect to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

  

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite – lived intangible assets such as inprocess research and development and trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review other than for inprocess research and development assets we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite – lived is appropriate 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment — the “component” level — discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

while we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2013 we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units 

the goodwill impairment test involves a twostep process in step one we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value we must perform step two of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in step two the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 

we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment we must recognize a noncash impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value 

fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units assumptions for sales net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

  

income approach used to determine fair values 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis we use a discount rate that reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value longterm growth rates provisions for income taxes future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless debtfree working capital 

2013 annual goodwill impairment test 

critical assumptions that the company used in performing the income approach for its reporting units included the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units our forecasts take into account the near and longterm expected business performance considering the longterm market conditions and business trends within the reporting units for example our current diversey care and hygiene solutions forecasts include an assumption of a modest economic recovery for europe beyond 2014 given the significant amount of revenue we generate from the diversey care and hygiene solutions businesses in europe the failure to realize or capitalize from this economic recovery may impact our ability to recover the allocated goodwill in the future for further discussion of the factors that could result in a change in our assumptions see “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k and our other filings with the sec 

  

2012 fourth quarter interim goodwill impairment test 

as discussed in note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” a goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units the critical assumptions that the company used in performing the income approach for these reporting units for the 2012 fourth quarter interim goodwill impairment review included the following 

 

  

  

  

 market approaches used to determine fair values 

each year we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value 

the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance the “public company method” these multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the company the “quoted price method” the third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publiclytraded and privatelyheld companies in our industries the “mergers and acquisition method” 

the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include trailing and future 12month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied under the first and second market approaches a control premium or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units we also compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization we evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions if the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates andor other assumptions 

for the fourth quarter 2012 interim goodwill impairment review and the 2013 annual goodwill impairment review of the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units we evaluated each of the above market approaches and determined that the public company and quoted price methods provided the most reliable measures of fair value because they were deemed to be a reliable proxy for the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units we applied a combined weighting of 20 to the two market approaches when determining the fair value of each of the reporting units for the 2013 annual goodwill impairment review of the 

  

packaging solutions product care and medical applications reporting units we also evaluated each of the above market approaches and determined that the public company the quoted price and the mergers and acquisition methods provided the most reliable measures of fair value because they were deemed to be a reliable proxy for these reporting units we applied a combined weighting of 20 to the three market approaches when determining the fair value of these reporting units 

2013 compared to fourth quarter 2012 — diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting units 

for our 2013 annual goodwill impairment test we determined that our diversey care reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of its respective carrying value of approximately 27 which represents an increase from the negative 12 previously calculated as of the fourth quarter of 2012 the hygiene solutions reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of its respective carrying value of approximately 91 which represents an increase from the 8 previously calculated as of the fourth quarter of 2012 

the increase in fair value of the diversey care reporting unit was due to improved forecasted cash flows which was driven by improved sales growth and reduced operating expenses the forecasted longterm sales growth is due to a combination of expected price increases across many of the regions as well as volume growth volume growth is forecasted in the amat region and the north american region is expected to recover with low sales growth in europe the longterm forecasts reflect volume decreases in 2014 due to the continued economic weakness in that region but are expected to show improvement starting in 2015 along with sales growth various activities including existing restructuring programs are expected to continue to result in reduced operating costs and contribute to a stronger cash flow 

the company is forecasting improved cash flows for the hygiene solutions reporting unit due to improved sales growth primarily being driven from the emerging markets which includes the amat and latin american regions due to a combination of volume growth and expected price increases and to a lesser extent sales growth in north america sales growth is expected to be flat in europe in 2014 but is expected to show improvement starting in 2015 however profitability in europe is expected to improve due to product rationalization and pricemix improvements hygiene solutions is also expecting overall improved profitability for the business resulting from improvements in sales and marketing costs which are expected to contribute to reduced operating costs and overall stronger cash flows 

in addition discount rates decreased in the 2013 annual goodwill review compared to the 2012 fourth quarter goodwill review which contributed to the increased fair value the discount rate for any given impairment test is based on current market data as of the respective valuation date and adjusted upward to incorporate certain risks due to performance of the reporting units the improved operating performance of the reporting units in 2013 and management’s expectation regarding improved longterm growth rates and overall profitability contributed to the reduced risk component of the discount rates used in the 2013 valuation 

if our assumptions and related estimates change in the future or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change such as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock a decline in current market multiples a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates an adverse action or assessment by a regulator heightened competition strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair values of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount ranging from approximately 14 to approximately 279 of the carrying amounts this hypothetical 10 decrease resulted in the diversey care and hygiene solutions reporting 

  

units having the excess of fair value over carrying amount of 14 and 72 respectively we will continue to monitor goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in management’s business strategy or significant declines in our stock price indicate that there may be potential indicator of impairment 

see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2013 and 2012 and other related information 

pensions 

for a number of our us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 

at december 31 2013 the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans was 192 million and the total net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2013 was 1 million at december 31 2013 the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 11 billion and the total net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2013 was 16 million 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2013 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2014 in millions 

 

   

 income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carry forwards and foreign tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 17 “income taxes” for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

at december 31 2013 we had 100 million notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps and no outstanding interest rate collars or options 

the information set forth in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k in note 13 “derivatives and hedging activities” under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 14 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 108 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2013 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

venezuela 

economic events in venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy under us gaap and the us dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela accordingly all bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured into us dollars using the then current exchange rate available to us and any changes in the exchange rate were reflected in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our venezuelan subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of operations 

the potential future impact to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for bolivardenominated transactions will depend on our access to us dollars and on the exchange rates in effect when we enter into remeasure and settle transactions therefore it is difficult to predict the future impact until each transaction settles at its applicable exchange rate or gets remeasured into us dollars 

  

on february 8 2013 the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar exchange rate from 43 bolivars to the us dollar to 63 bolivars to the us dollar we used this official exchange rate of 63 bolivars to the us dollar to remeasure the assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiaries for us gaap financial statement presentation as of december 31 2013 as a result of the changes in the exchange rates we recognized 13 million of net losses for the year ended december 31 2013 due to the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiaries’ financial statements and the impact due to the settlement of bolivardenominated transactions net losses on remeasurement were not material in 2012 and 2011 

on march 18 2013 the venezuelan government announced the creation of an alternative foreign currency mechanism called the supplementary foreign currency administration system known as the sicad during december 2013 the venezuelan government issued a new rule allowing the central bank to publish the average sicad rate previously it was prohibited by law to publish any rate different from the official exchange rate which was 113 bolivars per us dollar as stated above at december 31 2013 we remeasured our venezuelan subsidiaries financial statements using the official exchange rate of 63 bolivars to the us dollar however we will continue to evaluate each reporting period the appropriate exchange rate to remeasure our financial statements based on the facts and circumstances at that time 

for the year ended december 31 2013 less than 1 of our consolidated net sales and less than 5 of consolidated operating profit were derived from our businesses in venezuela as of december 31 2013 we had net assets of 54 million in venezuela which primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 47 million also as of december 31 2013 our venezuelan subsidiaries had a negative cumulative translation adjustment balance of 46 million 

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2013 would have caused us to pay approximately 108 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items   

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 13 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in part ii item 8 and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to certain financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2013 we had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 398 million at december 31 2013 and 429 million at december 31 2012 

  

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 12 million in 2013 14 million in 2012 and 9 million in 2011 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 31 million at december 31 2013 and 26 million at december 31 2012 

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2013 we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately 15 million in 2014 see note 15 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

our business strategies 

we seek to enhance our position as a leading global provider of innovative packaging and hygiene solutions that our customers use to improve safety efficiency and sustainability within their operations by focusing on six strategic priorities 

 

 we continue to expand our presence in both existing and new end market applications by focusing on innovative products and solutions that bring measurable sustainable value to our customers while also meeting the demands for cost and performance our solutions enhance topline growth for customers reduce costs through operational efficiency water reduction and waste prevention and mitigate risks 

as part of our smartlife™ initiative we look beyond the single product or service to consider the value chain where the solution is part of a broader lifecycle involving sourcing distribution use and even disposal in addition we will leverage the value our internal expertise brings to customers to generate new revenue streams and greater profitability 

 

 as part of our ongoing business portfolio review we are committed to identifying earlier and more definitively those customers and markets that offer us the best opportunity to deliver value added solutions and services that are sufficiently differentiated and valued in the marketplace in addition we are committed to leveraging our strengths to enhance our position with our food and beverage customers by doing so we improve access to a more secure food supply chain – one that is safer and more nutritious more efficient and less wasteful 

 

 with an international focus and extensive geographic footprint aligned to our greatest growth opportunities we will combine our local market knowledge with our broad portfolio and strengths in innovation and customer service to grow in developing regions urbanization global trade increased protein consumption and the ongoing conversion to safer and hygienically packaged foods and goods are key secular trends that underpin our confidence in our ability to grow rapidly in these parts of the world 

 

 we are focused on generating substantial operating cash flow from our existing business so that we can continue to invest in new products and technologies deleverage our balance sheet continue to pay a dividend and support growth in our share price we believe our ongoing process of critically analyzing our business portfolio and reallocating technical human and capital resources to the most promising market sectors from those sectors that are less strategic or have a lower level of financial performance will enhance our free cash flow generation performance and result in a higher return on assets thus improving shareholder value 

 

 the size and scale of our global operations affords us a continuing opportunity to derive greater supply chain efficiencies by leveraging our purchasing power optimizing our manufacturing and logistics footprint improving our internal processes and reducing complexity and cost in addition to reducing the cost of our supply chain operations we continue to focus on adapting the cost structure of our customer facing and backoffice operations to the appropriate level required to adequately support our external customer base and run the business effectively 

 

 we recognize that a core strength of our business is our people therefore we will continue to invest in the development of key skills in our diverse workforce while improving our ability to attract and retain new employees when we identify gaps in the current workforce

we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2012 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

seasonality 

historically net sales in our fb segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our il segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter second quarter sales represent a modest seasonal increase due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging and the third and fourth quarters of the year are relatively the same level as the second quarter net sales in our protective packaging segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

  

competition 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price there are also other companies producing competing products that are wellestablished since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership we invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year as compared with our packaging peers 

there are other manufacturers of fb products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the united states 

our fb hygiene solutions and il solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach we compete globally on premium product offerings and application expertise innovative product and dispensing equipment offerings valueadded solution delivery and strong customer service and support we differentiate our offerings from competitors by becoming the preferred partner to our customers and by providing innovative industryleading products to make their facilities safer and healthier for both maintenance staff and building occupants we believe our integrated solutions approach which includes the supply of machines tools chemicals processes and training to customers to drive productivity improvements reduces risk of food safety events and improve infection control to reduce health care acquired infections is a unique competitive strength additionally the quality ease of use and environmental profile of our products are unique and have helped support longstanding profitable relationships with many top customers 

our protective packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts and wood blocking and bracing systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products 

competition for most of our medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price technical design capability is an additional competitive factor for the rigid packaging offered by the medical applications business 

raw materials and sourcing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components equipment accessories and contract manufactured goods our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants chelates fragrances and paper and wood pulp products these raw materials represent approximately 40 of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials baginthebox containers bottles drums pails totes aerosol cans caps triggers valves and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment dilutioncontrol warewashing and laundry equipment floor care machines and items used in the maintenance of a facility such as air care dispensers floor care applicators microfiber mops and cloths buckets carts and other cleaning tools and utensils 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we source some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global sourcing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes the centralized management of procurement and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve sourcing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent sourcing practices 

research and development activities 

we maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and improve our existing products and processes including developing new packaging nonpackaging and chemical equipment and applications using our intellectual property from time to time we also acquire and commercialize new packaging and other products or techniques developed by others our research and development projects rely on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science chemistry package design and equipment engineering our research and development expense was 135 million in 2012 105 million in 2011 and 88 million in 2010 

our research and development activities are focused on enduse application as a result we operate 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

patents and trademarks 

we are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over 4900 united states and foreign patents and patent applications as well as an aggregate of over 9300 united states and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage as such each year we continue to file in the aggregate an average of 320 united states and foreign patent applications and 325 united states and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials in addition customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that incorporate renewable materials or that are otherwise viewed as being “environmentally sound” our new venture activities described above include the development of packaging products from renewable resources we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations to monitor their evolution and to meet this customer demand one advantage inherent in many of our products is that thin lightweight packaging solutions reduce waste and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives we continue to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they become available 

various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements in the united states we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the us environmental protection agency “epa” we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the united states these requirements are generally administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we also support our customers’ interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of our products or product packaging and for materials used in some of our products when possible materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in our protective packaging operations or offered to other manufacturers for use in other products in addition gains that we have made in internal recycling programs have allowed us to improve our net raw material yield thus mitigating the impact of resin costs while lowering solid waste disposal costs and controlling environmental liability risks associated with waste disposal 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees our website wwwsealedaircom contains additional detailed information about our corporate citizenship initiatives 

available information 

our internet address is wwwsealedaircom we make available free of charge on or through our website at wwwsealedaircom  our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports that we file or furnish pursuant to sections 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with or furnish them to the securities and exchange commission 




 item 1a risk factors 

introduction 

the risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

weakened global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

weakened global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example the recent global economic downturn has adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers hotels restaurants retail establishments other retailers business service contractors and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

  

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in 62 countries and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the united states and a majority of our net sales are generated outside of the united states operations outside of the united states particularly operations in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if the settlement agreement as defined in note 18 “commitments and contingencies” is not implemented we will not be released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace as defined below we do not control the timing of the cash payment required from us under the settlement agreement we are also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 sealed air completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving wr grace  co “grace” which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities since 2000 the company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction the company is responsible for the alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries while they vary these suits all appear to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability on april 2 2001 grace and certain of its subsidiaries filed for chapter 11 relief in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders dated may 3 2001 and january 22 2002 staying all asbestos actions against the company however the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” received the court’s permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction this proceeding was brought in the us district court for the district of delaware the “district court” adv no 0202210 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve the fraudulent transfer proceeding and all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates in connection with the cryovac transaction the settlement agreement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction the parties to the agreement in principle signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court signed an order approving the definitive settlement agreement although grace is not a party to the settlement agreement under the terms of the order grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions on september 19 2008 grace the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the asbestos pi future claimants’ representative and the official committee of equity security holders the “equity committee” filed as coproponents a plan of reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the “pi settlement plan” and several exhibits and associated documents including a disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court as filed the pi settlement plan would provide for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the united states bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated claims would be channeled the pi settlement plan also contemplates that the terms of our definitive settlement agreement will be incorporated into the pi settlement plan and that we will pay the amount contemplated by that agreement 

on january 31 2011 the bankruptcy court entered a memorandum opinion the “bankruptcy court opinion” overruling certain objections to the pi settlement plan on the same date the bankruptcy court entered an order regarding confirmation of the pi settlement plan the “bankruptcy court confirmation order” as entered on january 31 2011 the bankruptcy court confirmation order contained recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended that the district court approve the confirmation order and that the district court confirm the pi settlement plan and issue a channeling injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code thereafter on february 15 2011 the bankruptcy court issued an order clarifying the bankruptcy court opinion and the bankruptcy court confirmation order the “clarifying order” among other things the clarifying order provided that any references in the bankruptcy court opinion and the bankruptcy court confirmation order to a recommendation that the district court confirm the pi settlement plan were thereby amended to make clear that the pi settlement plan was confirmed and that the bankruptcy court was requesting that the district court issue and affirm the confirmation order including the injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code on march 11 2011 the bankruptcy court entered an order granting in part and denying in part a motion to reconsider the bankruptcy court opinion filed by bnsf railway company the “march 11 order” among other things the march 11 order amended the bankruptcy court opinion to clarify certain matters relating to objections to the pi settlement plan filed by bnsf 

  

various parties appealed or otherwise challenged the bankruptcy court opinion and the bankruptcy court confirmation order including without limitation with respect to issues relating to releases and injunctions contained in the pi settlement plan 

on january 30 2012 the district court issued a memorandum opinion the “original district court opinion” and confirmation order the “original district court confirmation order” overruling all objections to the pi settlement plan and confirming the pi settlement plan in its entirety including the issuance of the injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code on february 3 2012 garlock sealing technologies llc “garlock” filed a motion the “garlock reargument motion” with the district court requesting that the district court grant reargument rehearing or otherwise amend the original district court opinion and the original district court confirmation order insofar as they overruled garlock’s objections to the pi settlement plan on february 13 2012 the company cryovac and fresenius medical care holdings inc filed a joint motion the “sealed airfresenius motion” with the district court the sealed airfresenius motion did not seek to disturb confirmation of the pi settlement plan but requested that the district court amend and clarify certain matters in the original district court opinion and the original district court confirmation order also on february 13 2012 grace and the other proponents of the pi settlement plan filed a motion the “plan proponents’ motion” with the district court requesting certain of the same amendments and clarifications sought by the sealed airfresenius motion on february 27 2012 certain asbestos claimants known as the libby claimants” filed a response to the sealed airfresenius motion and the plan proponents’ motion the “libby response” the libby response did not oppose the sealed airfresenius motion or the plan proponents’ motion but indicated among other things that a the libby claimants had reached a settlement in principle of their objections to the pi settlement plan but that this settlement had not become effective and b the libby claimants reserved their rights with respect to the pi settlement plan pending the effectiveness of the libby claimants’ settlement on april 20 2012 as part of a more global settlement grace filed a motion with the bankruptcy court seeking among other things approval of settlements with the libby claimants and bnsf the settlements with the libby claimants and bnsf were approved by order of the bankruptcy court dated june 6 2012 thereafter the appeals of the libby claimants and bnsf with respect to the pi settlement plan were dismissed by orders of the united states court of appeals for the third circuit the “third circuit court of appeals” dated september 24 2012 and october 4 2012 the district court held a hearing on may 8 2012 to consider the garlock reargument motion on may 29 2012 anderson memorial hospital “anderson memorial” filed a motion seeking relief from and reconsideration of the original district court opinion and the original district court confirmation order the “anderson relief motion” in the anderson relief motion anderson memorial argued that a may 18 2012 decision by the third circuit court of appeals in a case called wright v owenscorning undermined the district court’s conclusion that a the pi settlement plan was feasible and b the asbestos property damage injunction and trust included in the pi settlement plan were appropriate objections to the anderson relief motion were filed by grace and the other proponents of the pi settlement plan and by the representative of future asbestos property damage claimants appointed in the grace bankruptcy proceedings on june 11 2012 the district court entered a consolidated order the “consolidated order” granting the sealed airfresenius motion the plan proponents’ motion and the garlock reargument motion and providing for amendments to the original district court opinion and the original district court confirmation order although the consolidated order granted the garlock reargument motion it did not constitute the district court’s agreement with garlock’s objections to the pi settlement plan which the district court continued to overrule also on june 11 2012 the district court entered an amended memorandum opinion the “amended district court opinion” and confirmation order the “amended district court confirmation order” overruling all objections to the pi settlement plan reflecting amendments described in the consolidated order and confirming the pi settlement plan in its entirety including the issuance of the injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code thereafter on july 23 2012 the district court issued a memorandum opinion and an order denying the anderson relief motion parties have appealed the amended district court opinion and the amended district court confirmation order to the third circuit court of appeals 

if it becomes effective the pi settlement plan may implement the terms of the settlement agreement but there can be no assurance that this will be the case notwithstanding the confirmation of the pi settlement plan by the bankruptcy court and the district court the terms of the pi settlement plan remain subject to amendment moreover the pi settlement plan is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions which are more fully set forth in the pi settlement plan and include without limitation the availability of exit financing and the approval of the pi settlement plan becoming final and no longer subject to appeal parties have appealed the amended district court confirmation order to the third circuit court of appeals or otherwise challenged the amended district court opinion and the amended district court confirmation order matters relating to the pi settlement plan the bankruptcy and amended district court opinions and the bankruptcy and amended district court confirmation orders may be subject to further appeal challenge and proceedings before the district court the third circuit court of appeals or other courts parties have challenged various issues with respect to the pi settlement plan the bankruptcy and amended district court opinions or the bankruptcy and amended district court confirmation orders including without limitation issues relating to releases and injunctions contained in the pi settlement plan 

although grace publicly indicated its intent to seek to emerge from bankruptcy before the appeals are fully and finally resolved it subsequently indicated that it was not able to receive the necessary consents and waivers to do so including from the company although grace has in the past indicated that with an appeals process before the third circuit court of appeals its target date to emerge from bankruptcy was the fourth quarter of 2013 we cannot assure you that this timing for emergence is or will be correct or that the target date for grace’s emergence has not been or will not be revised consistent with our settlement agreement we are prepared to pay the settlement amount directly to the asbestos trusts to be established under section 524g of the bankruptcy code once the conditions of the settlement agreement are fully satisfied among those conditions is that approval of an appropriate grace bankruptcy plan—containing all releases injunctions and protections required by the settlement agreement—be final and not subject to any appeal given the pending appeals which include without limitation challenges to the injunctions and releases in the pi settlement plan the condition that approval of the pi settlement plan be final and not subject to any appeal has not been satisfied at this time the company has not waived this or any other condition of the settlement agreement nor can there be any assurance that each of the parties whose consent or waiver is required for grace to emerge from bankruptcy while the appeals are pending will provide such consent or waiver 

while the bankruptcy court and the district court have confirmed the pi settlement plan we do not know whether or when the third circuit court of appeals will affirm the amended district court confirmation order or the amended district court opinion whether or when the bankruptcy and amended district court opinions or the bankruptcy and amended district court confirmation orders will become final and no longer subject to appeal or whether or when a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization will become effective assuming that a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court and the district court and does become effective we do not know whether the final plan of reorganization will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement or if the other conditions to our obligation to pay the settlement agreement amount will be met if these conditions are not satisfied or not waived by us we will not be obligated to pay the amount contemplated by the settlement agreement however if we do not pay the settlement agreement amount we and our affiliates will not be released from the various claims against us we will continue to review and monitor the progress of the grace bankruptcy proceedings including appeals and other proceedings relating to the pi settlement plan the bankruptcy and amended district court opinions and the bankruptcy and amended district court confirmation orders as well as any amendments or changes to the pi settlement plan or to the bankruptcy and amended district court opinions and confirmation orders to verify compliance with the settlement agreement 

  

if the settlement agreement does not become effective either because grace fails to emerge from bankruptcy or because grace does not emerge from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement then we and our affiliates will not be released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us and our affiliates noted above and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to be resolved through other means such as through agreement on alternative settlement terms or trials in that case we could face liabilities that are significantly different from our obligations under the settlement agreement we cannot estimate at this time what those differences or their magnitude may be in the event these liabilities are materially larger than the current existing obligations they could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

since november 2004 the company and specified subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of grace’s alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos containing products in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace has agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases the canadian cases are currently stayed a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by grace has been approved by the canadian court and the pi settlement plan provides for payment of these claims we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us will become operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in grace’s united states chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the pi settlement plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code as indicated above the bankruptcy court entered the bankruptcy court confirmation order on january 31 2011 and the clarifying order on february 15 2011 and the district court entered the original district court confirmation order on january 30 2012 and the amended district court confirmation order on june 11 2012 the canadian court issued an order on april 8 2011 recognizing and giving full effect to the bankruptcy court’s confirmation order in all provinces and territories of canada in accordance with the bankruptcy court confirmation order’s terms notwithstanding the foregoing the pi settlement plan has not become effective and we can give no assurance that the pi settlement plan or any other plan of reorganization will become effective assuming that a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court and the district court and does become effective if the final plan of reorganization does not incorporate the terms of the canadian settlement or if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay substantial damages which we cannot estimate at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

for further information concerning these matters see note 18 “commitments and contingencies” 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities the indentures that govern our senior notes and the agreements covering our accounts receivable securitization program restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the indenture governing certain of our senior notes these notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 

the terms of our credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the indentures governing our senior notes and the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities require us to maintain a specified net leverage ratio our ability to meet this financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 

a breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our senior notes or under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities furthermore if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our senior secured credit facilities those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness in the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 

  

  

  

 in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization program can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease as of december 31 2012 we had 1615 billion of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities at variable interest rates a 18 increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a 11 million increase or a 11 million decrease in annual interest expense in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical based raw materials and energy could increase our costs in addition the prices of many of the other key raw materials used in our businesses such as caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants polymers and resins chelates and fragrances are cyclical based on numerous supply and demand factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets including primarily those related to the settlement agreement may be affected by a number of factors 

we have deferred tax assets related to the settlement agreement other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes foreign tax credits us and foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize these assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

our largest deferred tax asset relates to our settlement agreement the value of this net asset which was 401 million at december 31 2012 reflects our anticipated tax benefit from the cash portion of the settlement agreement and related accrued interest and the fair market value of 18 million shares of our common stock at a postsplit price of 1786 per share which was the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 we will not be able to realize this deferred tax asset and related potential cash tax benefits until we fund our obligation under the settlement agreement we intend to carry back a significant portion of the loss resulting from our deduction under the settlement agreement the efficiency of any amount carried back and the benefit therefrom as well as the benefit from the amount carried forward may depend upon among other factors the year when we fund the settlement agreement our tax benefit may be significantly reduced resulting in an increased tax expense if we fund the settlement agreement later than 2013 the timing of our funding however is subject to factors beyond our control other facts that will impact our tax benefit include the amount of cash we pay our tax position and the applicable tax codes our past and anticipated future earnings in the us as well as the price of our common stock at the time we fund the settlement agreement for example our tax benefit will be reduced resulting in an increased tax expense if the price of our common stock at the time of funding is less than 1786 per share conversely although our cash tax benefit will increase any additional benefit resulting from an increased price per share will increase our paid in capital and not decrease our tax expense these conditions could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods in which these conditions occur in addition changes in statutory tax rates or other legislation or regulation may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate 

  

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as “mad cow” disease footandmouth disease and avian influenza or “birdflu” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products in recent years occasional cases of “mad cow” disease have been confirmed and incidents of birdflu have surfaced in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food businesses’ products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in the food processing and food service industries consumer preferences for food and packaging formats of prepackaged food can influence our sales as can consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods changes in consumer behavior including changes in consumer preferences driven by various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

customers in the food service food and beverage processing building care lodging retail and health care sectors have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

the market for our hygiene products is highly competitive our hygiene products businesses face significant competition from global national regional and local companies within some or all of its product lines in each sector that it serves barriers to entry and expansion in the institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene industry are low 

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products which would have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

concerns about greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials and freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits it is also possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our lines of credit including our senior secured credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization program we may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness including our senior notes and our senior secured credit facilities on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

strengthening of the us dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

approximately 65 of our net sales in 2012 were generated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 

also while we often produce in the same geographic markets as our products are sold expenses are more concentrated in the us than sales so that in a time of strengthening of the us dollar our profit margins could be reduced while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 13 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap see item 7aa quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk—foreign exchange rates—venezuela” 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the us and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate income tax provision changes in statutory tax rates and laws as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us for example legislative proposals to change us taxation of nonus earnings 

  

could increase our effective tax rate also changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate in addition our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure we are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies adverse developments in these laws or regulations or any change in position regarding the application administration or interpretation thereof in any applicable jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations in addition the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the united states may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations 

our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a hurricane tornado earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations we are dependent on internal and third party information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets as a result of the acquisition of diversey and we may never realize the full carrying value of these assets 

as a result of the acquisition of diversey we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment may result from among other things i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessment by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we recorded impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in 2012 see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for further discussion 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

the relationship with sc johnson  son inc “scj” is important to our institutional  laundry segment and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on this segment 

diversey is party to various agreements with scj including a brand license agreement the “bla” a technology disclosure and license agreement supply and manufacturing agreements and several leases under the bla diversey is granted a license in specified territories to sell certain scj products and use specified trade names owned by scj in the institutional and industrial channels of trade and subject to certain limitations in specified channels of trade in which both our il segment and scj’s consumer business operate scj and its affiliates supply products under the bla sales of these products have historically been significant to our il segment in addition in some countries our il segment depends on scj to produce or sell some of our products the bla purports to limit diversey’s right to market products with nonscj brands that scj has not approved in certain channels of trade in specified countries if we default under our agreements with scj and the agreements are terminated scj fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with scj is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our il segment consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

the relationship with unilever plc “unilever” is important to our institutional  laundry segment and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on this segment 

in connection with diversey’s acquisition of the diverseylever business unilever in 2002 diversey entered into various agreements with unilever including a license agreement and agency agreement pursuant to the license agreement unilever granted 31 diversey subsidiaries a license to produce and sell professional size packs of unilever’s consumer brand cleaning products in four countries the united kingdom ireland portugal and brazil the diversey subsidiaries operate under an agency agreement with unilever in addition diversey also holds licenses to use some trademarks and technology of unilever in the market for institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene products and related services we believe that these agreements are significant to our institutional  laundry segment if we default under our agreements with unilever and the agreements are terminated unilever fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with unilever is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our institutional  laundry segment consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies if any of our senior management or other key personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america the majority of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business 

we are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water and the use handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials 

many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our european operations as a result of a european union “eu” directive “registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals” eu directive no 20061907 enacted on december 18 2006 the directive imposes several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical substances manufactured or marketed in europe the eu has also recently enacted a “classification packaging and labeling” regulation other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the legacy diversey business had tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever pursuant to the unilever acquisition agreement as defined below 

under a previous acquisition agreement between the legacy diversey business and unilever the “unilever acquisition agreement” unilever made warranties to diversey with respect to the facilities formerly owned by unilever in addition unilever agreed to indemnify diversey for specified types of environmental liabilities if the aggregate amount of damages meets various dollar thresholds subject to a cap of 250 million in the aggregate diversey was required to notify unilever of any environmental indemnification claims by may 3 2008 any environmental claims pending after this date with respect to which diversey has notified unilever remain subject to indemnification until remediation is completed in accordance with the unilever acquisition agreement if diversey incurs damages or liabilities that do not meet the indemnity thresholds under the unilever acquisition agreement if diversey failed to notify unilever of an environmental indemnity claim within the period specified in the unilever acquisition agreement or if the aggregate limits on indemnity payments under the unilever acquisition agreement become applicable diversey would not be entitled to indemnity from unilever for such nonqualifying claims and it would be required to bear the costs 

diversey has previously tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever in connection with former unilever locations unilever has not indicated its agreement with diversey’s request for indemnification we may file additional requests for reimbursement in the future in connection with pending indemnification claims however there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover any amounts relating to these indemnification claims from unilever 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products this loss of a competitive advantage could result in decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the united states and in other countries where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we may not successfully integrate the diversey business 

we are continuing our integration of the diversey business with our legacy business we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the two businesses our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully completing the integration of our operations could adversely affect our results of operations challenges involved in the integration include 

 

  

 we may not successfully complete the integration of our operations in a timely manner and may have difficulty integrating the diversey business we may not achieve the synergy targets that we currently anticipate we may experience disruptions in relationships with current and new employees customers and suppliers 

we already have incurred and we may incur additional nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies some of these costs may be higher than anticipated we may also incur unanticipated costs including costs to maintain employee morale retain key employees and successfully integrate the diversey business 

we have made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition of diversey in our forecasts that may prove to be materially inaccurate

other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the us and in many foreign countries some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some on those that we lease standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters are located in a leased property in elmwood park new jersey for a list of those countries outside of the united states where we have operations see “foreign operations” above our website wwwsealedaircom  contains additional information about our worldwide business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

the information set forth in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k in note 18 “commitments and contingencies” under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2012 we were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “superfund” sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2012 environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

 as of january 31 2013 there were approximately 5580 holders of record of our common stock 

dividends 

our amended credit facility and the senior notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends however we do not believe these covenants are likely to materially limit the future payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock 

the following table shows our total cash dividends paid each year since we initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in 2006 

 

 on february 14 2013 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 013 per common share payable on march 15 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 1 2013 the estimated amount of this dividend payment is 25 million based on 195 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of january 31 2013 

the dividend payments discussed above are recorded as reductions to cash and cash equivalents and retained earnings on our consolidated balance sheets from time to time we may consider other means of returning value to our stockholders based on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations there is no guarantee that our board of directors will declare any further dividends

 on august 9 2007 we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of our issued and outstanding common stock described further under the caption “repurchases of capital stock” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k this program has no set expiration date this program replaced our prior share repurchase program which we terminated at that time 

  




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the information in this mda should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in part ii item 8 as well as the discussion included in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k all amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions except per share amounts 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed the sale of diversey japan in november 2012 and accordingly the operating results were reclassified to discontinued operations net of tax on the consolidated statements of operations for 2012 and 2011 also the assets and liabilities of the diversey japan operations were reclassified to assets and liabilities held for sale as of december 31 2011 see note 3 “divestiture” for further details all results included in this mda are presented on a continuing operations basis 

also during the fourth quarter of 2012 we began to operate under a new business division structure for our segment reporting structure all prior period segment results and discussions have been revised to conform to the new segment presentation the results include the operating results of diversey beginning october 3 2011 date of acquisition all results prior to october 3 2011 include historical sealed air results only the changes to the segment structure have no effect on the historical consolidated results of operations of the company 

overview 

we are a global leader in food safety and security facility hygiene and product protection we serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing food service retail health care and industrial commercial and consumer applications we have widely recognized and inventive brands such as bubble wrap ® brand cushioning cryovac ® brand food packaging solutions and diversey ® brand cleaning and hygiene solutions our focus is on achieving net sales growth through geographic expansion new and expanded relationships with customers and demonstrating the strength of our sustainability value proposition 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 8400 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies health care facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2012 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

historically net sales in our fb segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our il segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter second quarter sales represent a modest seasonal increase due to higher occupancy rates in european lodging and the third and fourth quarters of the year are relatively the same level as the second quarter net sales in our protective packaging segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments 

other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and as a result we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership our diversey solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach for more details see “competition” included in “business” of item 1 part i 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders 

2013 outlook 

we expect modest sales and adjusted ebitda growth despite our significant exposure to european markets and a recent increase in raw material costs we intend to take decisive actions to adjust pricing in product lines impacted by escalating raw material costs as a result we estimate 2013 net sales in the range of 77–79 billion adjusted ebitda of 1010 billion to 1030 billion and adjusted eps between 110 and 120 we also estimate free cash flow for 2013 of approximately 300 million to 350 million which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures we expect a core effective tax rate in the range of 25 to 27 in 2013 

adjusted eps guidance excludes the payment of the settlement agreement as the exact timing of the settlement is unknown final payment of the settlement agreement is expected to be accretive to adjusted eps by approximately 013 annually following the payment date under the assumption of using a substantial portion of cash on hand for the payment and ceasing to accrue interest on the settlement amount additionally guidance excludes any nonoperating gains or losses that may be recognized in 2013 due to currency fluctuations in venezuela 

  

highlights of financial performance 

below are the highlights of our financial performance for the three years ended december 31 2012

the following table presents a reconciliation of our us gaap eps to nonus gaap adjusted eps 

 

  

   see note 21 “net loss earnings per common share” for details on the calculation of our us gaap basic and diluted eps

 the discussions that follow provide further details about the material factors that contributed to the changes in our eps for the three years ended december 31 2012 

  

net sales by segment reporting structure 

the following table presents net sales by our segment reporting structure 

 

  

 net sales by geographic region 

by geographic region the components of the increase in net sales for 2012 compared with 2011 were as follows 

 

  

 by geographic region the components of the increase in net sales for 2011 compared with 2010 were as follows 

 

  

 foreign currency translation impact on net sales 

as shown above 65 of our consolidated net sales in 2012 were generated outside the us since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated net sales into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our net sales from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact the most significant currencies that contributed to the translation of our net sales and our other consolidated financial results in 2012 were the euro the british pound the australian dollar the brazilian real and the canadian dollar 

we experienced an unfavorable impact from the translation of our foreign currencydenominated net sales of 151 million in 2012 compared with 2011 this was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and brazilian real 

in 2011 we experienced a favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of 155 million compared with 2010 approximately 152 million of this favorable impact was experienced in the first nine months of 2011 as the us dollar began to strengthen against most of the significant currencies that contribute to our net sales and other consolidated financial results 

components of change in net sales 

the following tables present the components of change in net sales by our segment reporting structure for 2012 compared with 2011 and 2011 compared with 2010 

  

we also present the change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation a nonus gaap measure which we define as “constant dollar” we believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability between periods as it eliminates the volatility of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

  

  

  the following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis 

food  beverage segment net sales 

2012 compared with 2011 

the 590 million or 18 constant dollar increase in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 2011 compared with 2010 

the 277 million or 10 constant dollar increase in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these favorable drivers were partially offset by lower unit volumes in the canada of 14 million or 1 primarily due to a customer loss in the packaging solutions business this customer loss is not considered material to our consolidated net sales 

  

institutional  laundry segment net sales 

2012 compared with 2011 

the 1610 million constant dollar increase in net sales in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to 

 

  

 these factors were partially offset by a decrease in unit volumes in europe of 10 million or 4 reflecting a decline in consumer brands and lower equipment sales 

2011 compared with 2010 

the 534 million constant dollar increase in net sales in 2011 compared with 2010 represents the acquisition of the il business as part of the acquisition of diversey in the fourth quarter of 2011 

protective packaging segment net sales 

2012 compared with 2011 

the 20 million or 1 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to higher unit volumes in the us of 25 million or 3 due to expanded market presence and strengths in solutions targeting ecommerce applications this growth was partially offset by lower unit volumes in europe of 11 million or 3 primarily due to lower customer demand reflecting the current economic challenges in the region 

2011 compared with 2010 

the 82 million or 6 constant dollar increase in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to 

 

  

 cost of sales 

our primary input costs include raw materials such as polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants chelates fragrances and paper and wood pulp products these raw materials represent approximately one third of our cost of sales our other cost of sales inputs include direct and indirect labor other raw materials and other input costs including energyrelated costs and transportation costs the costs for our raw materials are impacted by the rise and fall in crude oil and natural gas prices since they serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of our raw materials the prices for these feedstocks have been particularly volatile in recent years as a result of changes in global demand in addition supply and demand imbalances of intermediate compounds such as benzene and supplier facility outages have impacted resin costs although changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas are indicative of the variations in certain raw materials and energyrelated costs they are not perfect benchmarks we continue to monitor changes in raw material and energyrelated costs as they occur and take pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases when they occur 

cost of sales for the three years ended december 31 2012 was as follows 

 

 2012 compared with 2011 

the 12 billion increase in cost of sales in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the incremental impact of costs of sales from acquired businesses of 12 billion from the food and beverage hygiene solutions and il businesses as a result of the acquisition of diversey in the fourth quarter of 2011 cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2012 compared with 2011 was also impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of 111 million costs for raw materials and freight were 15 million lower in 2012 compared with 2011 

2011 compared with 2010 

the 713 million increase in cost of sales in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

  

 marketing administrative and development expenses 

marketing administrative and development expenses for the three years ended december 31 2012 are included in the table below the amounts for 2011 and 2010 have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation of these expenses as we now present the amortization of intangible assets acquired as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations 

  

 2012 compared with 2011 

the 771 million increase in marketing administrative and development expenses in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to a 796 million incremental impact of expenses from acquired businesses from the food and beverage hygiene solutions and il businesses as a result of the acquisition of diversey in the fourth quarter of 2011 partially offset by the impact of favorable foreign currency translation of 27 million and a decrease in sharebased compensation of 8 million primarily because we did not achieve some of our 2012 financial performance goals 

2011 compared with 2010 

the 315 million increase in marketing administrative and development expenses in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

  

 these factors were partially offset by a decrease in sharebased compensation of 6 million primarily because we did not achieve some of our 2011 financial performance goals 

amortization expense of intangible assets acquired 

amortization expense of intangible assets acquired for the three years ended december 31 2012 were as follows 

 

 the increase in 2012 compared with both 2011 and 2010 was due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of diversey in the fourth quarter of 2011 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 

in 2012 we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 18923 million of goodwill and other intangible assets see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for information of the events and circumstances that lead to this impairment 

costs related to the acquisition and integration of diversey 

we recorded transaction and integration costs directly related to the acquisition of diversey of 7 million in 2012 and 65 million in 2011 the transaction related costs were 55 million and primarily consist of financing commitment legal regulatory and appraisal fees the remainder of the costs in both periods were integration costs primarily consisting of consulting fees as discussed above we have excluded these costs from our adjusted eps calculations see note 4 “acquisition of diversey holdings inc” for further discussion of the acquisition 

restructuring activities 

20112014 integration and optimization program 

in december 2011 we initiated a restructuring program associated with the integration of diversey’s business following our acquisition of diversey on october 3 2011 the program primarily consists of i reduction in headcount ii consolidation of facilities and iii supply chain network optimization and iv certain other capital expenditures this program is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 

see note 10 “restructuring activities” for further discussion of the charges and liabilities associated with this program 

we estimate that we realized approximately 105 million of benefits from this program in 2012 from headcount reductions elimination of redundant costs plant consolidations and procurement and logistics savings we anticipate realizing an incremental 90 million in benefits in 2013 

the actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to this program are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs spending and benefits to occur later expected in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs spending and benefits 

european principal company 

in may 2011 before the acquisition of diversey diversey’s management approved subject to successful works council consultations plans to reorganize its european operations to function under a centralized management and supply chain model we completed the reorganization on may 3 2012 and the epc based in the netherlands is now centrally managing diversey’s european operations diversey’s european subsidiaries are executing sales and distribution locally and local production companies are acting as toll manufacturers 

as part of the planning for this reorganization we recognized associated costs of 12 million in 2012 and 4 million in 2011 these costs are included in marketing administrative and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and in restructuring charges in 2011 related to termination benefits of 1 million 

  

global manufacturing strategy 

we announced our global manufacturing strategy program in 2006 and completed the program in 2010 the goals of this multiyear program were to realign our manufacturing footprint to expand capacity in growing markets to further improve our operating efficiencies and to implement new technologies more effectively additionally we optimized certain manufacturing platforms in north america and europe into centers of excellence by taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale we have continued to enhance our profitable growth and our global leadership position and have produced meaningful benefits 

the capital expenditures associated costs and related restructuring charges and the total amounts incurred since inception of this multiyear program are included in the table below 

 

 we estimate that we realized approximately 55 million in benefits in 2010 which were primarily realized in cost of sales 

european facility closure 

in december 2010 we closed a small shrink packaging factory in europe we took this action based on our review of operating costs and technology levels in an effort to simplify our plant network and improve our operating efficiency we recorded nominal associated costs and restructuring and other charges in 2011 and 7 million in 2010 the associated costs and restructuring and other charges related to the actions described above are considered special items and are excluded from our nonus gaap eps calculations see “diluted net earnings per common share” above for further details 

see note 10 “restructuring activities” for additional information on our recent restructuring activities 

operating loss profit 

management evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on its operating loss profit operating loss profit by our segment reporting structure for the three years ended december 31 2012 was as follows 

 

  

   

 see “restructuring activities” above for further discussion of restructuring activities 

food  beverage segment operating loss profit 

2012 compared with 2011 

2012 operating loss includes the noncash impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets of 543 million see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for further details the preimpairment operating profit remained flat in 2011 and 2012 

  

2011 compared with 2010 

the increase in operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to the net favorable impacts of the changes in net sales mentioned above which was partially offset by higher raw materials costs which we estimate to be 85 million higher in 2011 compared with 2010 

institutional  laundry segment operating loss profit 

2012 compared with 2011 

2012 operating loss includes the noncash impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets of 13 billion see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for further details the preimpairment operating profit increased by 62 million in 2012 compared to 2011 which was a result of the increase in net sales described above and lower raw materials costs being partially offset by higher marketing and administration costs 

2011 compared with 2010 

the increase in operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 was due to the acquisition of diversey in the fourth quarter of 2011 

protective packaging segment operating profit 

2012 compared with 2011 

operating profit remained flat in 2012 when compared to 2011 

2011 compared with 2010 

the increase in operating profit in 2011 compared with the same periods in 2010 was primarily due to the net favorable impacts of the changes in net sales mentioned above these factors were partially offset by higher raw materials costs which we estimate to be 32 million higher in 2011 compared with 2010 

other operating loss profit 

2012 compared with 2011 

2012 operating loss includes the noncash impairment charge of 22 million related to a decision to stop development work on a project included in our new venture business see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for further details a reduction in the preimpairment operating loss in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to lower development spending 

2011 compared with 2010 

the decline in operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to higher raw materials costs which we estimate to be 8 million higher compared with 2010 also contributing to the decline in operating profit were incremental expenses related to our new ventures these factors were partially offset by the net favorable impacts of the increases in unit volumes mentioned above 

interest expense 

interest expense includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt as well as the net impact of capitalized interest the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs bond discounts and terminated treasury locks 

interest expense for the three years ended december 31 2012 was as follows 

 

  

     

loss on debt redemption 

in november 2012 we issued 425 million of 650 senior notes and used substantially all of the proceeds to retire the 5625 senior notes due july 2013 we repurchased the 5625 notes at fair value the aggregate repurchase price was 421 million which included the principal amount of 400 million a 3 premium of 13 million and accrued interest of 8 million we recognized a total net pretax loss of 12 million which included the premiums mentioned above less a gain of 1 million on the termination of a related interest rate swap 

we amended and refinanced our credit facility to a reduce term loan b interest rates b gain additional flexibility on financial covenant and c amend certain other terms as a result we recognized a pretax loss of 16 million for the accelerated unamortized original issuance discounts of 9 million and the unamortized capitalized lender fees for 7 million we also recorded new original issuance discount and nonlender fees for a total of 2 million which are included in the carrying amount of the debt instruments in addition we recorded a pretax loss of 7 million of nonlender fees related to the transactions mentioned above 

see note 12 “debt and credit facilities” for details of our debt transactions 

in december 2010 we completed an early redemption of 150 million of the outstanding 300 million principal amount of our 12 senior notes due february 14 2014 we redeemed the notes at 127 of the principal amount plus accrued interest the aggregate redemption price was 196 million including 5 million of accrued interest we funded the redemption with available cash we recorded a pretax loss of 41 million resulting from the 27 premium we also recognized a gain of 2 million from the termination of a related interest rate swap as a result the total net pretax loss was 39 million which equated to a 014 per common share decrease to our reported net earnings per common share 

net gains on sale of availableforsale securities 

in 2010 we sold our five auction rate security investments representing our total holdings of these securities these sales resulted in a pretax gain of 7 million 4 million net of taxes before we sold these investments we recognized 1 million of pretax otherthantemporary impairment in 2010 due to the decline in estimated fair value of some of these investments 

foreign currency exchange losses gains related to venezuelan subsidiaries 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy the foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2012 2011 and 2010 for our venezuelan subsidiary were the result of two factors 1 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to settle bolivardenominated transactions and 2 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements at the balance sheet date we believe these gains and losses are attributable to the unstable foreign currency environment in venezuela see “venezuela” in “foreign exchange rates” of item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion on venezuela 

other expense net 

see note 20 “other expense net” for the components and discussion of other expense net 

income taxes 

our loss before income taxes from continuing operations for 2012 was reduced by an income tax benefit of 262 million our effective income tax benefit rate for 2012 was 14 because our net loss resulted from an impairment charge substantially all of which related to nondeductible goodwill with no corresponding tax benefit our core tax rate for the year was 26 our tax provision for the year benefitted from earnings in jurisdictions with low tax rates and losses in jurisdictions such as the us with high tax rates as well as favorable settlements of certain tax disputes totaling 12 million in 2012 the favorable factors were partially offset by losses in jurisdictions where we did not have any tax benefit due to the applicable tax rate or valuation allowances 

our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 30 for 2011 and 25 for 2010 as described below the legacydiversey operations and the costs of the diversey acquisition increased our 2011 effective tax rate for 2011 and 2010 our effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings as well as income tax benefits from tax credits and the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state income taxes and in 2011 nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with the diversey acquisition 

we expect an effective income tax rate in the range of 25 to 27 in 2013 

our effective tax rate also depends on the realization of our deferred tax assets net of our valuation allowances we have deferred tax assets related to the settlement agreement other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes foreign tax credits us and foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances employee benefit items and other items our largest deferred tax asset relates to our settlement agreement as described in note 15 “commitments and contingencies” 

we have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse or our ability to carry back any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences we expect to realize these assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets conversely if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances we may be able to reverse those valuation allowances our largest deferred tax asset relates to the settlement agreement we intend to carry back a significant portion of the loss resulting from our deduction under the settlement agreement our tax benefit with respect thereto may be significantly reduced resulting in an increased tax expense if the funding of the settlement agreement occurs later than 2013 or the price of our common stock at the time of funding of the settlement agreement is less than 1786 per share these conditions could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods in which these conditions occur in addition changes in statutory tax rates or other new legislation or regulation may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate see “material commitments and contingencies” below for further discussion 

see note 17 “income taxes” for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate which also shows the major components of the year over year changes 

liquidity and capital resources 

the discussion that follows contains descriptions of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

material commitments and contingencies 

settlement agreement and related costs 

we recorded a pretax charge of 850 million in 2002 of which 513 million represents a cash payment that we are required to make subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of w r grace  co we did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability 

we currently expect to fund a substantial portion of this payment when it becomes due by using accumulated cash and cash equivalents with the remainder from our committed credit facilities our new credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including the payment of the amounts required upon effectiveness of the settlement agreement see “principal sources of liquidity” below the cash payment of 513 million accrues interest at a 55 annual rate which is compounded annually from december 21 2002 to the date of payment this accrued interest was 364 million at december 31 2012 and is recorded in settlement agreement and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheet the total liability on our consolidated balance sheet was 877 million at december 31 2012 in addition the settlement agreement provides for the issuance of 18 million shares of our common stock since the impact of issuing these shares is dilutive to our eps under us gaap they are included in our diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in our calculation of eps if the impact of including these shares is dilutive see note 21 “net loss earnings per common share” for details of our calculation of eps 

tax benefits resulting from the anticipated funding of the settlement agreement were recorded as a 401 million net deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012 this deferred tax asset reflects the cash portion of the settlement agreement and related accrued interest and the value of the 18 million shares of our common stock at the postsplit price of 1786 per share which was the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 we intend to carry back a significant portion of the loss resulting from our deduction under the settlement agreement the efficiency of any amount carried back and the benefit therefrom as well as the benefit from the amount carried forward may depend upon among other factors the year when we fund the settlement agreement our tax benefit may be significantly reduced resulting in an increased tax expense if we fund the settlement agreement later than 2013 the timing of our funding however is subject to factors beyond our control other facts that will impact our tax benefit include the amount of cash we pay our tax position and the applicable tax codes our past and anticipated future earnings in the us as well as the price or our common stock at the time we fund the settlement agreement for example our tax benefit will be reduced resulting in an increased tax expense if the price of our common stock at the time of funding is less than 1786 per share conversely although our cash tax benefit will increase any additional benefit resulting from an increased price per share will increase our paid in capital and not decrease our tax expense 

if we are unable to generate sufficient us taxable income we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset and we may not realize the full cash tax benefit relating to this asset this could result in a significant increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods in which these conditions occur changes in statutory tax rates or other new legislation or regulation may also change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate 

while the bankruptcy court and the district court have confirmed the pi settlement plan parties have appealed or otherwise challenged the pi settlement plan and the opinions and orders entered by the bankruptcy court and the district court confirming the pi settlement plan these matters may be subject to further appeal challenge and proceedings before the district court the third circuit court of appeals or other courts parties have challenged various issues with respect to the pi settlement plan and the opinions and orders entered by the bankruptcy court and the district court including without limitation issues relating to releases and injunctions contained in the pi settlement plan we will continue to review and monitor the progress of the grace bankruptcy proceedings including appeals and other proceedings relating to the pi settlement plan the bankruptcy and the amended district court opinions and the bankruptcy and amended district court confirmation orders as well as any amendments or changes to the pi settlement plan or to the bankruptcy and the amended district court opinions and confirmation orders to verify compliance with the settlement agreement we do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement 

as mentioned in “2013 outlook” above our full year 2013 diluted net earnings per common share guidance continues to exclude the payment under the settlement agreement as the timing is unknown payment under the settlement agreement is expected to be accretive to our postpayment diluted net earnings per common share by approximately 013 annually this range primarily represents the accretive impact on our net earnings from ceasing to accrue any future interest on the settlement amount following the payment

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2013 and future years amounts in millions 

 

   

 

      current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt  — represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period 

operating leases  — the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under noncancelable real and personal property leases as of december 31 2012 

cash portion of the settlement agreement  — the settlement agreement is described more fully in “settlement agreement and related costs” of note 18 “commitments and contingencies” 

other principal contractual obligations  — other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy in the normal course of business these obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase the amounts included in the table above represent the minimum amounts we are obligated to pay under these agreements we may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and as a result use additional cash 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2012 we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 257 million most of which is included in other liabilities and the remaining balance as a reduction to current deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2012 we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities see note 17 “income taxes” for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have reviewed our offbalance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

income tax payments 

we currently expect to pay between 95 million and 115 million in income taxes in 2013 

contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our us and our nonus employees we currently expect our contributions to these plans be approximately 30 million in 2013 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated statements of operations balance sheets or cash flows we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

principal sources of liquidity 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses capital expenditures interest taxes and dividend payments and to pay our debt obligations and other longterm liabilities as they come due our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations accumulated cash and amounts available under our existing lines of credit described below including the amended credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program 

we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above and the cash payment under the settlement agreement should it become payable within the next 12 months 

see note 12 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents 

 

 see “analysis of historical cash flows” below 

  

lines of credit 

effective november 14 2012 we amended the revolving credit facility the amended revolving credit facility may be used for working capital needs and general corporate purposes including the payment of the amounts required upon effectiveness of the settlement agreement we used our amended revolving credit facility in connection with the sale of diversey japan and the refinancing of term loan a in 2012 interest paid for 2011 and 2012 under the original revolving credit facility and the amended revolving credit facility was insignificant there were no amounts outstanding under the original revolving credit facility at december 31 2011 and the amended revolving credit facility at december 31 2012 see note 12 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

accounts receivable securitization program 

at december 31 2012 we had 112 million available to us under the program we did not utilize this program in 2012 and 2011 see note 9 “accounts receivable securitization program” for information concerning this program 

covenants 

at december 31 2012 and 2011 we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations as discussed in “covenants” of note 12 “debt and credit facilities” 

debt ratings 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency 

 

 these credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade if our credit ratings are downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

outstanding indebtedness 

at december 31 2012 and 2011 our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table 

 

 see note 12 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

analysis of historical cash flow 

the following table shows the changes in our consolidated cash flows from continuing operations in the three years ended december 31 2012 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2012 was primarily attributable to net earnings adjusted to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities of 419 million which primarily included adjustments for depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and sharebased incentive compensation expenses net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash use of 14 million in 2012 

net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2011 was primarily attributable to net earnings adjusted to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities of 387 million which primarily included adjustments for depreciation and amortization costs related to the acquisition of diversey and sharebased incentive compensation expenses net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net spending of cash of 14 million in 2011 

net cash used in investing activities 

in 2012 we used net cash of 117 million in investing activities which was primarily due to capital expenditures of 124 million 

  

2011 

in 2011 we used net cash of 24 billion in investing activities due to capital expenditures of 123 million and the acquisition of diversey for 22 billion see note 4 “acquisition of diversey holdings inc” for further information 

we expect to continue to invest capital as we deem appropriate to expand our business to maintain or replace depreciating property plant and equipment to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity and net sales growth we expect total capital expenditures in 2013 to be approximately 160 million which include capital expenditures of 10 million associated with the 20112014 integration and optimization program this projection is based upon our capital expenditure budget for 2013 the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects anticipated future projects and historic spending trends 

net cash used in provided by financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the following

 2011 

net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 partially offset by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in working capital 

 

 the 45 million increase or 5 in working capital in the year ended december 31 2012 was primarily due to the following factors 

 

  

 partially offset by 

 

  

 changes in stockholders’ equity 

the 15 billion or 51 decrease in stockholders’ equity in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the decrease in retained earnings of 15 billion which reflects our net loss including the impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets of 16 billion net of taxes see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for further details

for further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of accounts receivable as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts which is included in marketing administrative and development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations these changes may reflect changes in economic business and market conditions the allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of chargeoffs net of recoveries 

the provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including but not limited to a regular assessment of the collectability of specific customer balances the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with our customers in circumstances where a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations is known we record a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount we reasonably assess will be collected if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to pay our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount 

fair value measurements of financial instruments 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 

 

  

  

 our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 14 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for further details on our fair value measurements 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we 

  

expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability and we expect to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

impairment of longlived assets 

for finitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite – lived intangible assets such as inprocess research and development and trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review other than for inprocess research and development assets we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite –lived is appropriate 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment — the “component” level — discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment we must recognize a noncash impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value 

fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units assumptions for sales net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

income approach used to determine fair values 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis we use a discount rate that reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value longterm growth rates provisions for income taxes future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless debtfree working capital 

market approaches used to determine fair values 

each year we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value 

the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance these multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the company the third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publiclytraded and privatelyheld companies in the our industries 

the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include trailing and future 12month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied under the first and second market approaches a control premium or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

see note 8 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2012 and other related information 

pensions 

for a number of our us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 

  

at december 31 2012 the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans was 210 million and the total net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2012 was 1 million at december 31 2012 the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 10 billion and the total net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2012 was 16 million 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2012 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2013 in millions 

 

 income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carry forwards and foreign tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 17 “income taxes” for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

at december 31 2012 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps collars or options 

the information set forth in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k in note 13 “derivatives and hedging activities” under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 14 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 110 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2012 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

venezuela 

economic events in venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy under us gaap and the us dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela accordingly all bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured into us dollars using the then current exchange rate available to us and any changes in the exchange rate were reflected in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our venezuelan subsidiaries on the consolidated statement of operations 

as a result of the changes in the exchange rates upon settlement of bolivardenominated transactions and upon the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiaries’ financial statements we recognized nominal net losses for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 and net gains of 6 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

for the year ended december 31 2012 less than 1 of our consolidated net sales and 5 million of operating profit were derived from our businesses in venezuela as of december 31 2012 we had net assets of 70 million in venezuela which primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 31 million also as of december 31 2012 our venezuelan subsidiaries had a negative cumulative translation adjustment balance of 46 million 

the potential future impact to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for bolivardenominated transactions will depend on our access to us dollars and on the exchange rates in effect when we enter into remeasure and settle transactions therefore it is difficult to predict the future impact until each transaction settles at its applicable exchange rate or gets remeasured into us dollars 

we used the official exchange rate at december 31 2012 of 43 bolivars to the us dollar to remeasure the assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiaries for us gaap financial statement presentation on february 8 2013 the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar to an exchange rate of 63 bolivars to the us dollar an approximate 32 devaluation which we estimate may result in a pretax loss of approximately 10 million to 15 million in the first quarter of 2013 this pretax loss which would be included in other income and expense on our consolidated statements of operations is mainly due to the remeasurement of the cash balances held in bolivars continuing restrictions on the foreign currency exchange market could affect our venezuelan operations’ ability to pay obligations denominated in us dollars as well as our ability to benefit from those operations 

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2012 would have caused us to pay approximately 87 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items   

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 13 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in part ii item 8 and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to certain financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2012 we had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 429 million at december 31 2012 and 633 million at december 31 2011 

  

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 14 million in 2012 9 million in 2011 and 7 million in 2010 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 26 million at december 31 2012 and 16 million at december 31 2011 

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2012 we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately 18 million in 2013 see note 15 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

our business strategies 

we are focused on protection and expanding our presence by innovating solutions that improve food safety and security facility hygiene and product protection our strategy aligns with three global trends the increased demand for protein and highquality prepared foods from an expanding middle class in developing regions greater public and regulatory demand for safe efficient and hygienic environments and the expansion of global supply chains and ecommerce which require efficient packaging solutions our business is well positioned to leverage these trends through our extensive portfolio of proprietary solutions leading research and development teams our large international footprint and presence in developing regions our access to broad distribution networks and our high levels of customer service 

the key strategic priorities developed to achieve our growth goals are 

maintain and expand our positions with key customers we have developed a reputation for delivering exceptional value to our customers as proven by our longstanding relationships and market leadership positions our total systems solution model often involves technology and equipment installed within our customers’ facilities which further enhances the value we bring to our customers we plan to build on the strength of these relationships to deliver endtoend solutions across the food “productionpackagingpreparationconsumption” continuum to become an increasingly important partner to our customers 

position our company to capture growth opportunities in developing regions we are focused on realizing growth from developing regions due to favorable demand trends including greater disposable income from a growing middle class the continued urbanization of populations increased wealth per capita driving greater demand for protein and higher quality foods and expansion of cold supply chains and westernstyle retail supermarkets which require more packaging as a result these regions represent opportunities for enhanced food production packaging and processing which offer growth opportunities for our solutions 

extend reach and maintain innovation leadership the diversey acquisition provides additional scope scale and geographic reach to deliver proprietary solutions to address our customers’ unmet needs in managing food safety hygiene and shelf life performance while maximizing productivity and risk management and reducing costs we believe our extensive competencies in food science equipment automation cleaning and sanitation and process integration position us to address these unmet needs globally we plan to build on these combined strengths by innovating new endtoend solutions across the food “productionpackagingpreparationconsumption” continuum that will provide measurable value for our customers and ultimately enhance the efficacy and efficiency of food supply chains 

integrate diversey and realize cost savings and revenue synergies we intend to achieve commercial and financial benefits from our integration of diversey we are proceeding with our extensive integration plan that addresses both commercial opportunities and areas for cost savings we expect to realize approximately 110 million to 115 million of annual gross cost savings by the end of 2014 we continue to anticipate 70 million of revenue synergies by the end of 2013 largely from expanding our access and presence within our food and beverage processing customers’ businesses and broadening our reach in developing regions we believe that cost and revenue synergies will further enhance our financial profile and future free cash flow generation 

utilize free cash flow to repay debt obligations we have a long track record of free cash flow generation and deleveraging through the economic cycle we plan to use internallygenerated free cash flow to repay our debt obligations as of december 31 2011 our net debt was 52 billion our goal is to reduce net debt to 49 billion by the end of 2012 and then to 45 billion by the end of 2013 in addition we plan to opportunistically invest in our businesses to further enhance our free cash flow generation in the future which will create additional value for shareholders

 in maintaining our foreign operations we face risks inherent in these operations such as currency fluctuations inflation and political instability information on currency exchange risk appears in part ii item 7a of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference other risks attendant to our foreign operations are set forth in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference information on the impact of currency exchange on our consolidated financial statements appears in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial information showing net sales and total longlived assets by geographic region for each of the three years ended december 31 2011 appears in note 4 “segments” which information is incorporated herein by reference we maintain programs to comply with the various laws rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countries in which we operate see “environmental matters” below 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 26300 employees worldwide approximately 8000 of these employees were in the us with approximately 160 of these employees covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 18300 employees who were outside the us approximately 5700 were covered by collective bargaining agreements outside of the us many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 

marketing distribution and customers 

at december 31 2011 we employed approximately 8200 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies health care facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers 

  

to support our food and new ventures customers we operate three packforum ® innovation and learning centers that are located in the us france and china at packforum ®  we assist customers in identifying the appropriate packaging materials and systems to meet their needs we also offer ideation services educational seminars employee training and customized graphic design services to our customers 

to assist our marketing efforts for our protective packaging products and to provide specialized customer services we operate 35 industrial package design and development centers pddc’s worldwide within our facilities these pddc’s are staffed with professional packaging engineers and outfitted with droptesting and other equipment used to develop test and validate costeffective package designs to meet each protective packaging customer’s needs 

to support our equipment systems and the marketing of our totals systems solutions we provide field technical services to our customers worldwide these services include system installation integration and monitoring systems repair and upgrade operator training in the efficient use of our systems qualification of various consumable and system combinations and equipment layout and design 

for our medical application customers we offer two cleanroom contract assembly and packaging facilities in two countries as well as a packaging validation lab 

our food packaging food solutions and food and beverage applications are largely sold direct while our protective packaging and a large component of the remaining enduse applications in diversey are sold through business supply distributors 

we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2011 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

seasonality 

historically net sales in our food businesses have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our protective packaging segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during the “backtoschool” season in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season the diversey segment’s net sales trend slightly lower in the first quarter while second quarter sales represent a modest seasonal peak due to the europeanbased lodging and food and beverage demand on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality 

however other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 

competition 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership we invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year as compared with our packaging peers there are also other companies producing competing products that are wellestablished 

there are other manufacturers of food packaging and food solutions products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the united states 

our protective packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts and wood blocking and bracing systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products 

  

our diversey solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach we compete globally on premium product offerings and application expertise innovative product and dispensing equipment offerings valueadded solution delivery and strong customer service and support we differentiate our offerings from competitors by becoming the preferred partner to our customers and by providing innovative industryleading products to make their facilities safer and healthier for both maintenance staff and building occupants we believe our integrated solutions approach which includes the supply of machines tools chemicals processes and training to customers to drive productivity improvements reduces risk of food safety events and improves infection control to reduce health care acquired infections is a unique competitive strength additionally the quality ease of use and environmental profile of our products are unique and have helped support longstanding profitable relationships with many top customers 

competition in specialty materials is focused on performance characteristics and price competition for most of our medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price technical design capability is an additional competitive factor for the rigid packaging offered by the medical applications business 

raw materials and sourcing 

suppliers provide raw materials packaging components equipment accessories and contract manufactured goods our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants chelates fragrances and paper and wood pulp products these raw materials represent approximately one third of our consolidated cost of sales we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials baginthebox containers bottles drums pails totes aerosol cans caps triggers valves and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment dilutioncontrol warewashing and laundry equipment floor care machines as well as items used in the maintenance of a facility such as air care dispensers floor care applicators microfiber mops and cloths buckets carts and other cleaning tools and utensils 

the vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our business natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future due to byproductcoproduct chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets several materials may become difficult to source these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we source some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs although we purchase some raw materials under longterm supply arrangements with third parties these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global sourcing strategy which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes the centralized management of procurement and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve sourcing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent sourcing practices 

research and development activities 

we maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and improve our existing products and processes including developing new packaging nonpackaging and chemical equipment and applications using our intellectual property from time to time we also acquire and commercialize new packaging and other products or techniques developed by others our research and development projects rely on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science chemistry package design and equipment engineering our research and development expense was 106 million in 2011 88 million in 2010 and 81 million in 2009 

our research and development activities are focused on enduse application as a result we operate 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 patents and trademarks 

we are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over 4600 united states and foreign patents and patent applications as well as an aggregate of over 9000 united states and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage as such each year we continue to file in the aggregate an average of 350 united states and foreign patent applications and 400 united states and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials in addition customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that incorporate renewable materials or that are otherwise viewed as being “environmentally sound” our new venture activities described above include the development of packaging products from renewable resources we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations to monitor their evolution and to meet this customer demand one advantage inherent in many of our products is that thin lightweight packaging solutions reduce waste and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives we continue to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they become available 

various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements in the united states we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the us environmental protection agency “epa” we are also subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by is for controlling microbial growth on humans animals and processed foods in the united states these requirements are general administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” to date the cost of complying with product registration requirements and fda compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

we also support our customers’ interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of our products or product packaging and for materials used in some of our products when possible materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in our protective packaging operations or offered to other manufacturers for use in other products in addition gains that we have made in internal recycling programs have allowed us to improve our net raw material yield thus mitigating the impact of resin costs while lowering solid waste disposal costs and controlling environmental liability risks associated with waste disposal

 item 1a   risk factors 

introduction 

investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors however they are not the only risk factors that you should consider in making an investment decision this form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

weakened global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

weakened global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins for example the recent global economic downturn has adversely impacted some of our endusers and customers such as food processors distributors supermarket retailers hotels restaurants retail establishments other retailers and ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and other endusers that are particularly sensitive to business and consumer spending 

during economic downturns or recessions there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in 62 countries and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the united states and a majority of our net sales are generated outside of the united states operations outside of the united states particularly operations in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if the settlement agreement as defined in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” is not implemented we will not be released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with grace we have no control over the timing of the cash payment required from us under the settlement agreement we are also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from grace’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on march 31 1998 sealed air completed a multistep transaction the “cryovac transaction” involving grace which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air corporation’s business under the common ownership of the company as part of that transaction grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction including asbestosrelated liabilities other than liabilities relating to cryovac’s operations and agreed to indemnify the company with respect to such retained liabilities since 2000 the company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction the company is responsible for the alleged asbestos liabilities of grace and its subsidiaries while they vary these suits all appear to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability on april 2 2001 grace and certain of its subsidiaries filed for chapter 11 relief in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the “bankruptcy court” in connection with grace’s chapter 11 case the bankruptcy court issued orders dated may 3 2001 and january 22 2002 staying all asbestos actions against the company however the official committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in grace’s chapter 11 case the “committees” received the court’s permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc based upon the cryovac transaction this proceeding was brought in the us district court for the district of delaware the “district court” adv no 0202210 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the committees to resolve the fraudulent transfer proceeding and all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates in connection with the cryovac transaction the settlement agreement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction the parties to the agreement in principle signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the bankruptcy court signed an order approving the definitive settlement agreement although grace is not a party to the settlement agreement under the terms of the order grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions on september 19 2008 grace the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the asbestos pi future claimants’ representative the “fcr” and the official committee of equity security holders the “equity committee” filed as coproponents a plan of reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the “pi settlement plan” and several exhibits and associated documents including a disclosure statement as filed and amended from time to time the “pi settlement disclosure statement” with the bankruptcy court as filed the pi settlement plan would provide for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the united states bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated claims would be channeled the pi settlement plan also contemplates that the terms of our definitive settlement agreement will be incorporated into the pi settlement plan and that we will pay the amount contemplated by that agreement 

on january 31 2011 the bankruptcy court entered a memorandum opinion the “bankruptcy court opinion” overruling certain objections to the pi settlement plan on the same date the bankruptcy court entered an order regarding confirmation of the pi settlement plan the “bankruptcy court confirmation order” as entered on january 31 2011 the bankruptcy court confirmation order contained recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended that the district court approve the confirmation order and that the district court confirm the pi settlement plan and issue a channeling injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code thereafter on february 15 2011 the bankruptcy court issued an order clarifying the bankruptcy court opinion and the bankruptcy court confirmation order the “clarifying order” among other things the clarifying order provided that any references in the bankruptcy court opinion and the bankruptcy court confirmation order to a recommendation that the district court confirm the pi settlement plan were thereby amended to make clear that the pi settlement plan was confirmed and that the bankruptcy court was requesting that the district court issue and affirm the confirmation order including the injunction under 

  

section 524g of the bankruptcy code on march 11 2011 the bankruptcy court entered an order granting in part and denying in part a motion to reconsider the bankruptcy court opinion filed by bnsf railway company the “march 11 order” among other things the march 11 order amended the bankruptcy court opinion to clarify certain matters relating to objections to the pi settlement plan filed by bnsf 

various parties appealed or otherwise challenged the bankruptcy court opinion and the bankruptcy court confirmation order including without limitation with respect to issues relating to releases and injunctions contained in the pi settlement plan on june 28 and 29 2011 the district court heard oral arguments in connection with appeals of the bankruptcy court opinion and the bankruptcy court confirmation order on january 30 2012 the district court issued a memorandum opinion the “district court opinion” and confirmation order the “district court confirmation order” overruling all objections to the pi settlement plan and confirming the pi settlement plan in its entirety including the issuance of the injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code on february 2 2012 garlock sealing technologies llc “garlock” filed a motion the “garlock reargument motion” with the district court requesting that the district court grant reargument rehearing or otherwise amend the district court opinion and the district court confirmation order insofar as they overrule garlock’s objections to the pi settlement plan on february 13 2012 the company cryovac and fresenius medical care holdings inc filed a joint motion the “sealed airfresenius motion” with the district court the sealed airfresenius motion does not seek to disturb confirmation of the pi settlement plan but requests that the district court amend and clarify certain matters in the district court opinion and the district court confirmation order also on february 13 2012 grace and the other proponents of the pi settlement plan filed a motion the “plan proponents’ motion” with the district court requesting certain of the same amendments and clarifications sought by the sealed airfresenius motion on february 27 2012 certain asbestos claimants known as the “libby claimants” filed a response to the sealed airfresenius motion and the plan proponents’ motion the “libby response” the libby response does not oppose the sealed airfresenius motion or the plan proponents’ motion but indicates among other things that a the libby claimants have reached a settlement in principle of their objections to the pi settlement plan but that this settlement has not become effective and b the libby claimants reserve their rights with respect to the pi settlement plan pending the effectiveness of the libby claimants’ settlement in addition parties have appealed the district court opinion and the district court confirmation order to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit the “third circuit court of appeals” by orders dated february 23 2012 the third circuit court of appeals stayed appeals of the district court opinion and the district court confirmation order pending disposition of motions filed in the district court with respect to the district court opinion and the district court confirmation order the district court has not ruled on the garlock reargument motion the sealed airfresenius motion or the plan proponents’ motion in addition on february 27 2012 garlock filed a motion the “garlock stay motion” requesting that the district court stay the district court opinion and the district court confirmation order until the later of 14 days after the disposition of the garlock reargument motion or disposition of any timely appeal by garlock of the district court opinion and the district court confirmation order the district court has not ruled on the garlock stay motion 

if it becomes effective the pi settlement plan may implement the terms of the settlement agreement but there can be no assurance that this will be the case notwithstanding the confirmation of the pi settlement plan by the bankruptcy court and the district court the terms of the pi settlement plan remain subject to amendment moreover the pi settlement plan is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions which are more fully set forth in the pi settlement plan and include without limitation the availability of exit financing and the approval of the pi settlement plan becoming final and no longer subject to appeal parties have appealed the district court confirmation order to the third circuit court of appeals or otherwise challenged the district court opinion and the district court confirmation order matters relating to the pi settlement plan the bankruptcy and district court opinions and the bankruptcy and district court confirmation orders may be subject to further appeal challenge and proceedings before the district court the third circuit court of appeals or other courts parties may designate various issues to be considered in challenging the pi settlement plan the bankruptcy and district court opinions or the bankruptcy and district court confirmation orders including without limitation issues relating to releases and injunctions contained in the pi settlement plan 

while the bankruptcy court and the district court have confirmed the pi settlement plan we do not know whether or when the third circuit court of appeals will affirm the district court confirmation order or the district court opinion whether or when the bankruptcy and district court opinions or the bankruptcy and district court confirmation orders will become final and no longer subject to appeal or whether or when a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization will become effective assuming that a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court and the district court and does become effective we do not know whether the final plan of reorganization will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement or if the other conditions to our obligation to pay the settlement agreement amount will be met if these conditions are not satisfied or not waived by us we will not be obligated to pay the amount contemplated by the settlement agreement however if we do not pay the settlement agreement amount we and our affiliates will not be released from the various claims against us 

if the settlement agreement does not become effective either because grace fails to emerge from bankruptcy or because grace does not emerge from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement then we and our affiliates will not be released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us and our affiliates noted above and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to be resolved through other means such as through agreement on alternative settlement terms or trials in that case we could face liabilities that are significantly different from our obligations under the settlement agreement we cannot estimate at this time what those differences or their magnitude may be in the event these liabilities are materially larger than the current existing obligations they could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

since november 2004 the company and specified subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of grace’s alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos containing products in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace has agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases the canadian cases are currently stayed a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by 

  

grace has been approved by the canadian court and the pi settlement plan provides for payment of these claims we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us will become operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in grace’s united states chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the pi settlement plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code as indicated above the bankruptcy court entered the bankruptcy court confirmation order on january 31 2011 and the clarifying order on february 15 2011 and the district court entered the district court confirmation order on january 30 2012 however we can give no assurance that the pi settlement plan or any other plan of reorganization will become effective assuming that a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court and the district court and does become effective if the final plan of reorganization does not incorporate the terms of the canadian settlement or if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay substantial damages which we cannot estimate at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

for further information concerning these matters see note 17 “commitments and contingencies” 

we require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness the ability to generate cash andor refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including our senior notes and our new credit facility and to fund planned capital expenditures research and development efforts and other corporate expenses depends on our future operating performance and on economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of these factors are beyond our control we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings including synergies related to our acquisition of diversey and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other operating requirements significant delays in our planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects 

the indenture governing our new senior notes and the credit agreement for our new credit facility restrict our ability and the ability of most of our subsidiaries to engage in some business and financial transactions 

new senior notes  the indenture governing our new senior notes contains restrictive covenants that among other things limit our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 new credit facility  the credit agreement for our new credit facility contains a number of covenants that 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

the credit agreement for our new credit facility also contains other covenants customary for credit facilities of this nature our ability to borrow additional amounts under our credit facility depends upon satisfaction of these covenants events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products the prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemicalbased raw materials and energy could increase our costs in addition the prices of many of the key raw materials used in our diversey business such as caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants polymers and resins chelates and fragrances are cyclical based on numerous supply and demand factors that are beyond our control if we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing pricing or other actions our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as “mad cow” disease footandmouth disease and avian influenza or “birdflu” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products in recent years occasional cases of mad cow disease have been confirmed and incidents of bird flu have surfaced in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food businesses’ products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

demand for our products could be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences 

our sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by our customers in the food processing and food service industries consumer preferences for food and packaging formats of prepackaged food can influence our sales as can consumer preferences for fresh and unpackaged foods changes in consumer behavior including changes in consumer preferences driven by various healthrelated concerns and perceptions could negatively impact demand for our products 

the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

customers in the building care food service food and beverage processing lodging retail and health care sectors have been consolidating in recent years and we believe this trend may continue such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers which could in turn adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished 

the market for our diversey segment’s products is highly competitive our diversey segment faces significant competition from global national regional and local companies within some or all of its product lines in each sector that it serves barriers to entry and expansion in the institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene industry are low 

  

our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products which would have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

concerns about greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials and freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits it is also possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our existing and new lines of credit including our new credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness including our new senior notes and our new credit facility on commercially reasonable terms or at all our accounts receivable securitization program includes a bank financing commitment that must be renewed annually prior to the expiration date the bank financing commitment was renewed on december 2 2011 while the bank is not obligated to renew the bank financing commitment we have negotiated annual renewals since the commencement of the program in 2001 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under the senior secured credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

strengthening of the us dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

a majority of our net sales are generated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 

also while we often produce in the same geographic markets as our products are sold expenses are more concentrated in the united states compared with sales so that in a time of strengthening of the us dollar our profit margins could be reduced while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under us gaap effective january 1 2010 see “sealed air management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — foreign exchange rates — venezuela” 

we may use financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” 

in all jurisdictions in which we operate we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment foreign trade and currency exchange transactions these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets including primarily those related to the settlement agreement may be affected by a number of factors 

we have deferred tax assets related to the settlement agreement other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes foreign tax credits foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our 

  

ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends in part upon our future operating results we expect to realize these assets over an extended period if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have an adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations in addition changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax assets or liability balances with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation 

our largest deferred tax asset relates to our settlement agreement the value of this asset which was 384 million at december 31 2011 may be affected by our tax situation at the time of the payment under the settlement agreement as well as by the value of our common stock at that time the deferred tax asset reflects the fair market value of 18 million shares of our common stock at a postsplit price of 1786 per share based on the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 we will not be able to realize this deferred tax asset and related cash tax benefits until a plan of reorganization of grace becomes effective 

our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of us and foreign earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate income tax provision changes in statutory tax rates and laws as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us for example legislative proposals to change us taxation of nonus earnings could increase our effective tax rate also changes in the mix of earnings or losses between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate in addition our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 

we are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions as a result any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure we are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies adverse developments in these laws or regulations or any change in position regarding the application administration or interpretation thereof in any applicable jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations in addition the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction including the united states may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions if any applicable tax authorities including us tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of our operations 

our performance and prospects for future growth could be adversely affected if new products do not meet sales or margin expectations 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a tornado hurricane earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

we are dependent on internal and third party information technology networks and systems including the internet to process 

transmit and store electronic information in particular we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders applying cash receipts and placing purchase orders with suppliers making cash disbursements and conducting digital marketing activities data processing and electronic communications among business locations we also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel and our customers and suppliers future system disruptions security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets as a result of the acquisition of diversey and we may never realize the full carrying value of these assets 

as a result of the acquisition of diversey we recorded a significant amount of additional goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships trademarks and developed technologies 

we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired amortizable intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable impairment may result from among other things i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessment by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of in the event that we determine that events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

the relationship with sc johnson  son inc “scj” is important to our diversey business and any damage to this relationship could have a material adverse effect on the diversey business 

our diversey segment is party to various agreements with scj including a brand license agreement the “bla” a technology disclosure and license agreement supply and manufacturing agreements and several leases under the bla diversey is granted a license in specified territories to sell certain scj products and use specified trade names and house marks owned by scj including the right to use “johnson” in combination with its owned trade name “diversey” in the institutional and industrial channels of trade and subject to certain limitations in specified channels of trade in which both diversey’s business and scj’s consumer business operate scj and its affiliates supply products under the bla sales of these products have historically been significant to diversey’s business in addition in some countries diversey depends on scj to produce or sell some of its products if we default under our agreements with scj and the agreements are terminated scj fails to perform its obligations under these agreements or our relationship with scj is otherwise damaged or severed this could have a material adverse effect on our diversey business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

diversey also holds licenses to use some trademarks and technology of unilever in the market for institutional and industrial cleaning sanitation and hygiene products and related services under license agreements with unilever we believe that these license agreements are significant to our diversey business and the termination of our rights under any of these agreements may have a material adverse effect on our diversey business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

if we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us and we need their expertise to execute our business strategies if any of our senior management or other key personnel ceases to work for us our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the integration process and our ability to successfully conduct the combined business going forward will require the experience and expertise of key employees from both sealed air and diversey therefore the ability to successfully integrate operations as well as the future success of the combined company’s operations will depend in part on our ability to retain such key employees we may not be able to retain key employees for the time period necessary to complete the integration process or beyond although we do not have any reason to believe any of these employees will cease to be employed by us the loss of such employees could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

on july 28 2011 david h kelsey notified us of his resignation as chief financial officer of the company effective as of august 12 2011 tod s christie who was serving as the company’s treasurer was appointed as the interim chief financial officer effective as of the close of business on august 12 2011 we intend to appoint a new chief financial officer once we have identified and agreed on terms with a suitable candidate we can provide no assurance as to how long it will take us to appoint a new chief financial officer 

we could experience disruptions in operations andor increased labor costs 

in europe and latin america the majority of our employees is represented by labor unions and is covered by collective bargaining agreements which are generally renewable on an annual basis as is the case with any negotiation we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members a disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business 

the united states patient protection and affordable care act and the united states health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could result in increased costs related to our postretirement benefit plans 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law these statutes include a number of provisions that will impact companies that provide retiree health care benefits through postretirement benefit plans and will require certain changes to be made to individual plans in order to comply with the new legislation 

in addition these statutes require changes to our information technology infrastructure and in our administrative processes the ultimate extent and cost of these changes including the timing of when these costs will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements cannot be determined at this time but will continue to be evaluated as regulations and interpretations relating to the legislation become available 

we are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial liability and increased operating costs 

our operations are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental health and safety laws and regulations that govern among other things the manufacture of our products the discharge of pollutants into the air soil and water and the use handling transportation storage and disposal of hazardous materials 

some jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration and labeling of some of our products some of these laws require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and operations any failure to obtain maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or penalties revocation or nonrenewal of our permits or orders to cease certain operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for example a recent unfavorable court decision regarding a municipal operating permit for one of our food packaging facilities in sao paulo brazil leaves the facility subject to an administrative procedure that could lead to the closure of the facility although we are working to resolve the dispute if our facility is required to close or relocate we could incur substantial costs 

  

we generate use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes in the event our operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment we may become responsible for the costs associated with the investigation and 

remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants or sites where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes even if we fully complied with environmental laws at the time of disposal we have been and may continue to be responsible for the cost of remediation at some locations 

we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our european operations as a result of a european union “eu” directive “registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals” eu directive no 20061907 enacted on december 18 2006 the directive imposes several requirements related to the identification and management of risks related to chemical substances manufactured or marketed in europe the eu has also recently enacted a classification packaging and labeling regulation other jurisdictions may impose similar requirements 

we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance product registration or environmental remediation environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions as a result of such requirements we may be subject to an increased regulatory burden and we expect significant future environmental compliance obligations in our operations increased compliance costs increasing risks and penalties associated with violations or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the legacy diversey business had tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever pursuant to the unilever acquisition agreement as defined below 

under a previous acquisition agreement between the legacy diversey business and unilever the “unilever acquisition agreement” unilever made warranties to diversey with respect to the facilities formerly owned by unilever in addition unilever agreed to indemnify diversey for specified types of environmental liabilities if the aggregate amount of damages meets various dollar thresholds subject to a cap of 250 million in the aggregate diversey was required to notify unilever of any environmental indemnification claims by may 3 2008 any environmental claims pending after this date with respect to which diversey has notified unilever remain subject to indemnification until remediation is completed in accordance with the unilever acquisition agreement if diversey incurs damages or liabilities that do not meet the indemnity thresholds under the unilever acquisition agreement if diversey failed to notify unilever of an environmental indemnity claim within the period specified in the unilever acquisition agreement or if the aggregate limits on indemnity payments under the unilever acquisition agreement become applicable diversey would not be entitled to indemnity from unilever for such nonqualifying claims and it would be required to bear the costs 

diversey has previously tendered various environmental indemnification claims to unilever in connection with former unilever locations unilever has not indicated its agreement with diversey’s request for indemnification we may file additional requests for reimbursement in the future in connection with pending indemnification claims however there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover any amounts relating to these indemnification claims from unilever 

our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business 

our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling storing transporting and use of the products we sell we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent nevertheless our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices if a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance we may have to pay the claim with our own funds which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks patents and other intellectual property we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a manner that capitalizes on our trademarks and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our profitability and liquidity 

our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property if we were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products this loss of a competitive advantage could result in decreased sales or increased operating costs either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position including protecting the formulation and manufacturing techniques of many of our products as such we have not sought us or international patent protection for some of our principal product formula and manufacturing processes accordingly we may not be able to prevent others from developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products 

  

we own a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products aspects thereof methods of use andor methods of manufacturing there is a risk that our patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications 

we own or have licenses to use all of the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products both in the united states and in other countries where our products are principally sold trademark and trade name protection is important to our business although most of our trademarks are registered in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we operate we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the costs required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial 

we cannot be certain that we will be able to assert these intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated circumvented or challenged other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace third parties including competitors may assert intellectual property infringement or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others’ proprietary rights we may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all 

any failure by us to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

the relocation of manufacturing capability from diversey’s us manufacturing facility could adversely affect our business consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

our legacy diversey business manufactures a significant portion of the products it sells the lease from scj of the waxdale manufacturing facility in sturtevant wisconsin will expire on may 31 2013 and we do not plan to renew this lease after expiration we have made arrangements to relocate its manufacturing capability by moving some production to its other locations in north america and by pursuing contract manufacturing for a portion of its product lines the timeline to transition out of waxdale is not certain but production is expected to cease and decommissioning is expected to begin during the first half of 2012 this relocation may pose significant risks which could include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may not achieve growth through acquisitions 

as part of our business strategy we may from time to time pursue acquisitions of companies that we believe are strategic to our business there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets negotiate satisfactory terms for acquisitions or obtain necessary financing for acquisitions further acquisitions involve risks including that acquired businesses will not perform in accordance with expectations that we will not realize the operating efficiencies expected from acquisitions and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of companies we acquire will prove to have been incorrect if we fail to complete acquisitions if we acquire companies but are not able to successfully integrate them with our business or if we do not otherwise realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for our acquisitions our business and results of operations may be adversely affected in addition future acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expense amortization expenses and significant charges relating to integration costs 

  

the combination of our business with the diversey business will require significant management attention and we may incur significant additional integration costs because of integration difficulties and other challenges 

we are in the process of integrating the diversey business with our legacy business we are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the two businesses our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully completing the integration of our operations could adversely affect our results of operations challenges involved in the integration include 

 

  

 we may not successfully complete the integration of our operations in a timely manner and may have difficulty integrating the diversey business we may not achieve the synergy targets that we currently anticipate we may experience disruptions in relationships with current and new employees customers and suppliers 

we already have incurred and we expect to incur additional nonrecurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies some of these costs may be higher than anticipated we may also incur unanticipated costs including costs to maintain employee morale retain key employees and successfully integrate the diversey business 

we have made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition of diversey in our forecasts that may prove to be materially inaccurate 

we have made certain assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings revenue synergies and associated costs of the acquisition of diversey our assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings revenue synergies and associated costs of the acquisition may be inaccurate based on the information available to us or as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition higher than expected integration costs unknown liabilities and global economic and business conditions that may adversely affect the combined company following the completion of the acquisition

other products we produce other products in 26 manufacturing facilities of which 10 are in north america 12 in the emea region 3 in latin america and 1 in the asiapacific region 

other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the united states and in many foreign countries some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some on those that we lease standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters are located in a leased property in elmwood park new jersey for a list of those countries outside of the united states where we have operations see “foreign operations” above our website wwwsealedaircom  contains additional information about our worldwide business 

we believe that our manufacturing warehouse office and other facilities are well maintained suitable for their purposes and adequate for our needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

the information set forth in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k in note 17 “commitments and contingencies” under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2011 we were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “superfund” sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2011 environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

market information 

our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the trading symbol see the table below shows the quarterly high and low closing sales prices of our common stock and cash dividends per share for 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 as of january 31 2012 there were approximately 6000 holders of record of our common stock 

dividends 

our new credit facility and the notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends however we do not believe these covenants are likely to materially limit the future payment of quarterly cash dividends on our common stock 

the following table shows our total cash dividends paid each year since we initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in 2006 

 

 on february 16 2012 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 013 per common share payable on march 16 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 2 2012 the estimated amount of this dividend payment is 25 million based on 192 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of january 31 2012 

the dividend payments discussed above are recorded as reductions to cash and cash equivalents and retained earnings on our consolidated balance sheets from time to time we may consider other means of returning value to our stockholders based on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations there is no guarantee that our board of directors will declare any further dividends 

common stock performance comparisons 

the following graph shows for the five years ended december 31 2011 the cumulative total return on an investment of 100 assumed to have been made on december 31 2006 in our common stock the graph compares this return “see” with that of comparable investments assumed to have been made on the same date in a the standard  poor’s 500 stock index “composite sp 500” b a prior selfconstructed peer group “peer group 1” and c an updated selfconstructed peer group “peer group 2” 

  

the prior peer group 1 includes us and the following other companies avery dennison corporation ball corporation bemis company inc crown holdings inc greif inc meadwestvaco corporation owensillinois inc packaging corporation of america pactiv corporation for 2006 through 2009 rocktenn company rockwood holdings inc silgan holdings inc sonoco products co and templeinland inc pactiv corporation is included in peer group 1 only in the periods 2006 through 2009 pactiv was acquired on november 16 2010 and concurrently delisted as a public company 

in 2011 as a result of the acquisition of diversey we revised our peer group and designated it peer group 2 which replaced peer group 1 beginning january 1 2012 we decided to utilize peer group 2 rather than peer group 1 because we believe that peer group 2 more closely represents public companies in packaging and chemical and related industries that are comparable to us based on sales total assets numbers of employees and market capitalization following the diversey acquisition further the organization and compensation committee of our board of directors or compensation committee will use this peer group to benchmark executive compensation going forward 

the updated peer group 2 includes us and the following companies agrium inc air products  chemicals inc ashland inc avery dennison corporation ball corporation bemis company inc celanese corporation crown holdings inc eastman chemical company ecolab inc huntsman corporation meadwestvaco corporation monsanto company the mosaic company owensillinois inc ppg industries inc praxair inc the sherwinwilliams company and sonoco products co

our management may assess our financial results such as gross profit operating profit and diluted net earnings per common share “eps” both on a us gaap basis and on an adjusted nonus gaap basis examples of some other supplemental financial metrics our management will also use to assess our financial performance include earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” adjusted ebitda adjusted eps adjusted cash eps and free cash flow these nonus gaap financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the core operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain onetime expenses andor gains which may not occur in each period presented and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and peers more difficult obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts our nonus gaap financial measures may also be considered in calculations of our performance measures set by the organization and compensation committee of our board of directors for purposes of determining incentive compensation 

  

the nonus gaap financial metrics mentioned above exclude items we consider unusual or special items and also exclude their related tax effects we evaluate the unusual or special items on an individual basis our evaluation of whether to exclude an unusual or special item for purposes of determining our nonus gaap financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item including among other things i its nature ii whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations and iii whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis 

another nonus gaap financial metric we present is our core income tax provision andor core tax rate our core taxes are measures of our us gaap reported effective tax rate which is adjusted for the same items applicable to our core taxes that are excluded from our adjusted net earnings and adjusted eps metrics we consider our core taxes as an indicator of the taxes on our core business the tax situation and effective tax rate of a specific country where the excluded or special items occur will determine the impact positive or negative on our core taxes 

in our “highlights of financial performance” “net sales by segment reporting structure” “net sales by geographic region” and in some of the discussions and tables that follow we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information which we define as “constant dollar” changes in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation are nonus gaap financial measures as a worldwide business it is important that we take into account the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies nonetheless we cannot directly control changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently when our management looks at net sales to measure the performance of our business we typically exclude the impact of foreign currency translation from net sales we also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations as a result our management believes that these presentations may be useful to investors 

overview 

we are a global leader in food safety and security facility hygiene and product protection we serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing food service retail health care and industrial commercial and consumer applications we have widely recognized and inventive brands such as bubble wrap ® brand cushioning cryovac ® brand food packaging solutions and now as a result of our acquisition of diversey on october 3 2011 diversey ® brand cleaning and hygiene solutions we offer efficient and sustainable solutions that create business value for customers enhance the quality of life for consumers and provide a cleaner and healthier environment for future generations 

at december 31 2011 we employed approximately 8200 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers lodging retail pharmaceutical companies health care facilities medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2011 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

historically net sales in our food businesses have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events net sales in our protective packaging segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during the “backtoschool” season in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season the diversey segment’s net sales trend slightly lower in the first quarter while second quarter sales represent a modest seasonal peak due to the europeanbased lodging and food and beverage demand on a consolidated basis there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality 

however other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including but not limited to changes in raw materials and other costs foreign exchange rates interest rates taxes and restructuring and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and other nonrecurring charges 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and as a result we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership our diversey solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across each product category competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach for more details see “competition” included in “business” of item 1 part i 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased and other raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

  

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders 

significant 2011 events 

acquisition of diversey 

on october 3 2011 we completed the acquisition of diversey the financial results presented in this mda include the financial results of diversey for the period beginning october 3 2011 through december 31 2011 see note 1 “organization and nature of operations” and note 3 “acquisition of diversey holdings inc” for further details 

quarterly cash dividends 

we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of 013 per common share on march 18 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 4 2011 on june 17 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on june 3 2011 on september 16 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on september 2 2011 and on december 16 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on december 2 2011 we used available cash totaling 87 million to pay these quarterly cash dividends

2012 outlook 

our 2012 adjusted eps is anticipated to be in the range of 150 per share to 160 per share 

our adjusted eps range reflects the following assumptions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 additionally we anticipate capital expenditures to be in the range of 180 million to 190 million which includes capital expenditures associated with the 20112014 integration and optimization program see “restructuring activities” below 

our adjusted eps outlook excludes the payment of the settlement agreement as the exact timing of the settlement is unknown final payment of the settlement agreement is expected to be accretive to eps by approximately 013 annually following the payment date under the assumption of using a substantial portion of cash on hand for the payment and ceasing to accrue interest on the settlement agreement amount additionally our outlook excludes any nonoperating gains or losses that may be recognized in 2012 due to currency fluctuations in venezuela

foreign currency translation impact on net sales 

as shown above 59 of our consolidated net sales in 2011 were generated outside the us since we are a us domiciled company we translate our foreign currencydenominated net sales into us dollars due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar translating our net sales from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact the most significant currencies that contributed to the translation of our net sales and our other consolidated financial results in 2011 were the euro the australian dollar the brazilian real the canadian dollar the british pound and the mexican peso 

we experienced a favorable impact from the translation of our foreign currencydenominated net sales of 155 million in 2011 compared with 2010 approximately 152 million of this favorable impact was experienced in the first nine months of 2011 as the us dollar began to strengthen against most of the significant currencies that contribute to our net sales and other consolidated financial results in the fourth quarter of 2011 

in 2010 we experienced a favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of 70 million compared with 2009 due to the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the us dollar 

components of change in net sales 

the following tables present the components of change in net sales by our segment reporting structure for 2011 compared with 2010 and 2010 compared with 2009 we also present the change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation a nonus gaap measure which we define as “constant dollar” we believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability between periods 

 

  

  

   

the following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis 

food packaging segment net sales 

2011 compared with 2010 

the 68 million or 4 constant dollar increase in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these favorable drivers were partially offset by lower unit volumes in canada of 14 million or 18 primarily due to a customer loss this customer loss is not considered material to our consolidated net sales 

2010 compared with 2009 

the 34 million or 2 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to 

 

 partially offset by 

 

 the unfavorable impact of product pricemix in north america was primarily due to selectively lower pricing associated with higher customer volume commitments which offset the benefits of our price increases and formula contract adjustments in the year the unfavorable impact of product pricemix in the latin american region was primarily due to the volatility of the venezuelan currency as discussed above 

food solutions segment net sales 

2011 compared with 2010 

the 37 million or 4 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

 these favorable drivers were partially offset by lower unit volumes in the us of 25 million or 7 resulting from a change in our caseready format by a major retailer in mid2010 a portion of this lost unit volume is now being supplied to the major retailer in another format by our food packaging segment the remainder of the lost unit volume was not material to our consolidated net sales 

  

2010 compared with 2009 

the 30 million or 4 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to 

 

  

 these factors were partially offset by a decline in product pricemix in europe of 5 million or 2 primarily due to the timing of price adjustments for changes in resin costs experienced in the first half of 2010 

protective packaging segment net sales 

2011 compared with 2010 

the 72 million or 6 constant dollar increase in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to higher unit volumes in the us of 29 million or 4 in asia of 13 million or 11 and in europe of 6 million or 2 these unit volume increases were predominantly due to higher yearoveryear industrial production rates in those regions which in turn favorably affected the sales of our protective packaging products to existing customers in the order fulfillment space and our inflatable materials and equipment systems to new and existing customers in the ecommerce space we also experienced favorable product pricemix in the us of 12 million or 2 and in europe of 10 million or 3 due to the benefits of pricing actions that were implemented to offset rising raw materials costs 

2010 compared with 2009 

the 96 million or 8 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily the result of higher unit volumes in north america of 60 million or 9 in europe of 24 million or 7 and in the asia pacific region of 17 million or 13 these increases were principally attributable to improving economic conditions in these regions which were consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends also contributing to the higher unit volumes to a lesser extent was strength in fulfillment and ecommerce applications 

diversey segment net sales 

reported net sales were 796 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and are included in the year over year comparison as volume — acquired businesses net of dispositions 

other net sales 

2011 compared to 2010 

the 23 million or 7 constant dollar increase in net sales in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to higher unit volumes in europe of 10 million or 6 primarily in our specialty materials business which was attributable to higher demand for our products from the construction sector also contributing to this increase was higher unit volumes in our medical applications business in asia of 6 million or 28 since we received chinese government approval to import distribute and sell a reformulated medical film late in the third quarter of 2010 

2010 compared to 2009 

the 17 million or 5 constant dollar increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily attributed to higher unit volumes in north america of 12 million or 11 and in europe of 16 million or 11 these increases were primarily attributable to higher unit volumes for some of our specialty materials products which were principally the result of improving economic conditions in these regions consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends partially offsetting these factors was lower unit volumes in our medical applications business in asia of 13 million or 38 primarily due to the impact of an april 2010 licensing expiration in china late in the third quarter of 2010 our license was renewed 

  

cost of sales 

our primary input costs include raw materials such as polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films caustic soda solvents waxes phosphates surfactants chelates fragrances and paper and wood pulp products these raw materials represent approximately one third of our cost of sales our other cost of sales inputs include direct and indirect labor other raw materials and other input costs including energyrelated costs and transportation costs the costs for our raw materials are impacted by the rise and fall in crude oil and natural gas prices since they serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of our raw materials the prices for these feedstocks have been particularly volatile in recent years as a result of changes in global demand in addition supply and demand imbalances of intermediate compounds such as benzene and supplier facility outages have impacted resin costs although changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas are indicative of the variations in certain raw materials and energyrelated costs they are not perfect benchmarks we continue to monitor changes in raw material and energyrelated costs as they occur and take pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases when they occur 

in this cost of sales section and in the marketing administrative and development expenses section below when we refer to “variable incentive compensation” we are referring to our annual us profit sharing contribution in both sections and our annual cash incentive compensation in the marketing administrative and development expenses section variable incentive compensation does not include our sharebased incentive compensation programs details about our sharebased incentive compensation programs are included in note 18 “stockholders’ equity” 

cost of sales for the three years ended december 31 2011 was as follows 

 

 2011 compared with 2010 

the 762 million increase in cost of sales in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

  

 2010 compared with 2009 

the 213 million increase in cost of sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

  

   

the factors above that drove the increase in cost of sales in 2010 compared with 2009 were partially offset by our supply chain productivity improvements including lower headcount in 2010 compared with 2009 despite higher unit volumes and by the benefits of producing products in our new lowcost facilities in developing regions 

also partially offsetting the increase in cost of sales was lower variable incentive compensation expenses of 6 million in 2010 compared with 2009 because we did not meet some of our 2010 financial performance goals 

expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of gms were 4 million in 2010 compared with 10 million in 2009 

marketing administrative and development expenses 

marketing administrative and development expenses for the three years ended december 31 2011 is included in the table below the amounts for 2010 and 2009 have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation of these expenses as we now present the amortization of intangible assets acquired as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations 

 

 2011 compared with 2010 

the 336 million increase in marketing administrative and development expenses in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to 

 

  

  

  

 these factors were partially offset by a decrease in sharebased compensation of 6 million primarily because we did not achieve some of our 2011 financial performance goals 

2010 compared with 2009 

marketing administrative and development expenses decreased 9 million in 2010 compared with 2009 these expenses decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses of approximately 30 million in 2010 primarily because we did not meet some of our 2010 financial performance goals see the table below for further details 

this factor was partially offset by 

 

  

   

our variable incentive compensation expense includes annual cash incentives and our annual us profit sharing contribution we also have longterm sharebased incentive compensation that is included in marketing administrative and development expenses the table below shows the year over year changes in these expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 

 

  

 amortization expense of intangible assets acquired 

amortization expense of intangible assets acquired for the three years ended december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

 the increase in 2011 compared with 2010 was due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of diversey in the fourth quarter of 2011 

costs related to the acquisition of diversey 

we recorded 65 million of transaction and integration costs directly related to the acquisition of diversey in 2011 the transaction related costs were 55 million and primarily consist of financing commitment legal regulatory and appraisal fees the remainder of the costs in both periods were integration costs primarily consisting of consulting fees as discussed above we have excluded these costs from our adjusted eps calculations in 2011 see note 3 “acquisition of diversey holdings inc” for further discussion of the acquisition 

restructuring activities 

20112014 integration and optimization program 

as part of our previously announced integration of diversey we are undertaking a number of actions to integrate and realign our organization further improve operating efficiencies and lower our overall cost structure to maximize cost synergies and better meet customers’ needs this program primarily consists of i a reduction in headcount ii the consolidation of facilities and iii the consolidation and streamlining of certain customer and vendor contracts and relationships 

we have extended our program through 2014 and have increased our annual cost synergy run rate benefit target by the end of 2014 to a range of 110 million to 115 million this compares to our initial annual cost synergy estimate of 50 million in 2013 we expect to achieve the estimated cost synergy benefits as follows 

 

   we expect to achieve these synergies through the elimination of duplicative roles the consolidation of our business units into three primary business units in 2012 supply chain network optimization which includes the closure or consolidation of several small facilities to streamline our operations and the benefits of scale in procurement logistics and warehousing as well as in information systems and other shared services we anticipate these cost savings to be realized equally within cost of sales and in marketing administrative and development expenses 

  

we currently anticipate the total associated costs and restructuring charges related to this program to be 165 million to 185 million we expect to incur the majority of these costs in 2012 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of 53 million or 018 on an earnings per share basis this charge was primarily for termination and benefits costs of which 29 million was paid in the quarter this restructuring charge includes 38 million related to stock appreciation rights “sars” that were granted as part of the consideration for the acquisition of diversey see note 3 “acquisition of diversey holdings inc” for further discussion 

additionally we anticipate capital expenditures of 40 million to 50 million through 2014 related to the program and expect to spend 20 million in 2012 the actual timing of future costs is subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the spending and benefits to occur later than we now expect additionally changes in foreign currency exchange translation may impact future costs and benefits 

see note 9 “restructuring activities” for further discussion of this program 

revenue synergies 

we continue to anticipate 70 million of revenue synergies by the end of 2013 largely from expanding our access and presence within our food and beverage processing customers’ businesses and broadening our reach in developing regions in the fourth quarter of 2011 we began to secure new accounts and are currently in the process of closing additional opportunities with customers 

european principal company 

in may 2011 before the acquisition of diversey diversey approved subject to successful works council consultations plans to reorganize its european operations to function under a centralized management and supply chain model after completing the reorganization in 2012 the european principal company epc based in the netherlands is expected to centrally manage diversey’s european operations the european subsidiaries will execute sales and distribution locally and local production companies will act as toll manufacturers on behalf of the epc 

as part of the planning for this reorganization in the fourth quarter of 2011 we recognized associated costs of 4 million which are included in marketing administrative and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and restructuring charges related to termination benefits of 1 million 

we anticipate benefits from this reorganization to come from lower overhead costs from a centralized management and supply chain model as well as tax savings we anticipate additional associated andor restructuring costs in 2012 and net benefits to begin in 2013 the amount and timing of costs and benefits is subject to change due to a variety of factors such as the overall profitability of our european business administrative efficiency and foreign currency exchange translation 

global manufacturing strategy 

we announced our global manufacturing strategy program in 2006 and completed the program in 2010 the goals of this multiyear program were to realign our manufacturing footprint to expand capacity in growing markets to further improve our operating efficiencies and to implement new technologies more effectively additionally we optimized certain manufacturing platforms in north america and europe into centers of excellence by taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale we have continued to enhance our profitable growth and our global leadership position and have produced meaningful benefits 

the capital expenditures associated costs and related restructuring charges and the total amounts incurred since inception of this multiyear program are included in the table below 

 

 we estimate that we realized approximately 25 million in benefits in 2008 which increased to 45 million in 2009 and increased further to 55 million in 2010 these benefits are primarily realized in cost of sales 

  

european facility closure 

in december 2010 we informed affected employees that we would be closing a small shrink packaging factory in europe we took this action based on our review of operating costs and technology levels in an effort to simplify our plant network and improve our operating efficiency we recorded nominal associated costs and restructuring and other charges in 2011 and 7 million in 2010 we do not expect to record any material remaining costs associated with this closure 

the associated costs and restructuring and other charges related to the actions described above are considered special items and are excluded from our nonus gaap eps calculations see “diluted net earnings per common share” above for further details 

see note 9 “restructuring activities” for additional information on our recent restructuring activities 

operating profit 

management evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on its operating profit operating profit by our segment reporting structure for the three years ended december 31 2011 was as follows 

 

  

 

  

  

 see “restructuring activities” above for further discussion of restructuring activities 

food packaging segment operating profit 

2011 compared with 2010 

the increase in operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to the net favorable impacts of the changes in net sales mentioned above which was partially offset by higher raw materials costs which we estimate to be 60 million higher in 2011 compared with 2010 

  

2010 compared with 2009 

the increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impact of the increase in unit volumes mentioned above also contributing to this segment’s increase in operating profit were lower marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales which include the impact of lower variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above these factors were partially offset by higher raw materials costs of approximately 51 million 

expenses in this segment related to the implementation of gms were 3 million in 2010 compared with 8 million in 2009 

food solutions segment operating profit 

2011 compared with 2010 

the increase in operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to the net favorable impacts of the changes in net sales mentioned above these factors were partially offset by higher raw materials costs which we estimate to be 25 million higher in 2011 compared with 2010 

2010 compared with 2009 

the increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impacts of the increase in unit volumes and product pricemix both mentioned above also contributing to this segment’s increase in operating profit were lower marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales which include the impact of lower variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above these factors were partially offset by higher raw materials costs of approximately 30 million 

protective packaging segment operating profit 

2011 compared with 2010 

the increase in operating profit in 2011 compared with the same periods in 2010 was primarily due to the net favorable impacts of the changes in net sales mentioned above these factors were partially offset by higher raw materials costs which we estimate to be 32 million higher in 2011 compared with 2010 

2010 compared with 2009 

the increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impact of the increase in unit volumes mentioned above also contributing to this segment’s increase in operating profit were lower marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales which include the impact of lower variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above these factors were partially offset by higher raw materials costs of approximately 35 million expenses included in this segment’s operating profit related to the closure of a small factory in europe were 3 million in 2010 

diversey segment operating loss 

our diversey segment reported a 3 million operating loss in 2011 this loss reflects the results of diversey from october 3 2011 through december 31 2011 

  

in addition to the incremental results of diversey mentioned above the segment’s operating loss in 2011 reflected the following items 

 

  

  

 other operating profit 

2011 compared with 2010 

the decline in operating profit in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to higher raw materials costs which we estimate to be 8 million higher compared with 2010 also contributing to the decline in operating profit were incremental expenses related to our new ventures these factors were partially offset by the net favorable impacts of the increases in unit volumes mentioned above 

2010 compared with 2009 

the decline in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 14 million also contributing to the decline in operating profit were incremental expenses related to our new ventures these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in unit volumes mentioned above 

interest expense 

interest expense includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt as well as the net impact of capitalized interest the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs bond discounts and terminated treasury locks 

interest expense for the three years ended december 31 2011 was as follows 

 

  

    

net gains on sale of availableforsale securities 

in 2010 we sold our five auction rate security investments representing our total holdings of these securities these sales resulted in a pretax gain of 7 million 4 million net of taxes before we sold these investments we recognized 1 million of pretax otherthantemporary impairment in 2010 due to the decline in estimated fair value of some of these investments 

our valuation of our auction rate security investments resulted in the recognition of otherthantemporary impairment of 4 million 2 million net of taxes in 2009 

foreign currency exchange losses gains related to venezuelan subsidiaries 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy the foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2011 and 2010 for our venezuelan subsidiary were the result of two factors 1 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to settle bolivardenominated transactions and 2 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements at the balance sheet date we believe these gains and losses are attributable to the unstable foreign currency environment in venezuela see “venezuela” in “foreign exchange rates” of item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion on venezuela 

loss on debt redemption 

in december 2010 we completed an early redemption of 150 million of the outstanding 300 million principal amount of our 12 senior notes due february 14 2014 we redeemed the notes at 127 of the principal amount plus accrued interest the aggregate redemption price was 196 million including 5 million of accrued interest we funded the redemption with available cash we recorded a pretax loss of 41 million resulting from the 27 premium we also recognized a gain of 2 million from the termination of a related interest rate swap as a result the total net pretax loss was 39 million which equated to a 014 per common share decrease to our reported diluted net earnings per common share the annual pretax interest expense savings from this redemption is 18 million which equates to 006 per diluted common share beginning in december 2010 through february 2014 

in 2009 we redeemed the entire 4313 million of our 3 convertible senior notes due 2033 and recorded a 3 million pretax loss this loss represented a 0429 call premium of 2 million and a writedown of the remaining debt issuance costs of 1 million related to the issuance of these senior notes in july 2003 

the losses associated with our debt redemptions have been excluded from our nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings per common share see “diluted net earnings per common share” below for further details 

other expense net 

see note 20 “other expense net” for the components and discussion of other expense net 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 310 for 2011 255 for 2010 and 259 for 2009 as described below the diversey operations and the costs of the diversey acquisition increased our 2011 effective tax rate the costs of the acquisition are not expected to recur to the same extent in future years as such we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 30 for 2012 

for 2011 and 2010 our effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings as well as income tax benefits from tax credits and the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state income taxes and in 2011 nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with the diversey acquisition 

see note 16 “income taxes” for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate which also shows the major components of the year over year changes

 material commitments and contingencies 

settlement agreement and related costs 

we recorded a pretax charge of 850 million in 2002 of which 513 million represents a cash payment that we are required to make subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of w r grace  co we did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability 

we currently expect to fund a substantial portion of this payment when it becomes due by using accumulated cash and cash equivalents with the remainder from our committed credit facilities our new credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including the payment of the amounts required upon effectiveness of the settlement agreement see principal sources of liquidity below the cash payment of 513 million accrues interest at a 55 annual rate which is compounded annually from december 21 2002 to the date of payment this accrued interest was 319 million at december 31 2011 and is recorded in settlement agreement and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheet the total liability on our consolidated balance sheet was 831 million at december 31 2011 in addition the settlement agreement provides for the issuance of 18 million shares of our common stock since the impact of issuing these shares is dilutive to our eps under us gaap they are included in our diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in our calculation of eps for all periods presented see note 19 “net earnings per common share” for details of our calculation of eps 

tax benefits resulting from the payment made under the settlement agreement are currently recorded as a 380 million deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheets this deferred tax asset reflects the cash portion of the settlement agreement and related accrued interest and the value of the 18 million shares of our common stock at the postsplit price of 1786 per share which was the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 the amount and timing of our future cash tax benefits could vary depending on the amount of cash paid by us and various facts and circumstances at the time of payment under the settlement agreement including the price of our common stock our tax position and the applicable tax codes 

while the bankruptcy court and the district court have confirmed the pi settlement plan parties have appealed or otherwise challenged the pi settlement plan and the opinions and orders entered by the bankruptcy court and the district court confirming the pi settlement plan these matters may be subject to further appeal challenge and proceedings before the district court the third circuit court of appeals or other courts parties may designate various issues to be considered in challenging the pi settlement plan and the opinions and orders entered by the bankruptcy court and the district court including without limitation issues relating to releases and injunctions contained in the pi settlement plan we will continue to review the grace bankruptcy proceedings including appeals and other proceedings relating to the pi settlement plan or to the opinions and orders entered by the bankruptcy court and the district court confirming the pi settlement plan as well as any amendments or other changes to the pi settlement plan or to the opinions and orders entered by the bankruptcy court and the district court confirming the pi settlement plan to verify compliance with the settlement agreement we do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement 

as mentioned in “2012 outlook” above our full year 2012 diluted net earnings per common share guidance continues to exclude the payment under the settlement agreement as the timing is unknown payment under the settlement agreement is expected to be accretive to our postpayment diluted net earnings per common share by approximately 013 annually this range primarily represents the accretive impact on our net earnings from ceasing to accrue any future interest on the settlement amount following the payment

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2012 and future years amounts in millions 

 

  

  

  

    

 current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt  — represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period 

operating leases  — the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under noncancelable real and personal property leases as of december 31 2011 

cash portion of the settlement agreement  — the settlement agreement is described more fully in “settlement agreement and related costs” of note 17 “commitments and contingencies” 

other principal contractual obligations  — other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy in the normal course of business these obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2011 we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 279 million which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2011 we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities see note 16 “income taxes” for further discussion 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have reviewed our offbalance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

income tax payments 

we currently expect to pay between 115 million and 135 million in income taxes in 2012 

contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our us and our nonus employees we currently expect employer contributions to be approximately 39 million in 2012 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated statements of operations balance sheets or cash flows we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

principal sources of liquidity 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses capital expenditures interest taxes and dividend payments and to pay our debt obligations and other longterm liabilities as they come due our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations accumulated cash and amounts available under our existing lines of credit described below including the credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program 

we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above and the cash payment under the settlement agreement should it become payable within the next 12 months 

in connection with the funding of the cash consideration for the acquisition and the repayment of existing indebtedness of diversey and to provide ongoing liquidity on october 3 2011 we entered into the credit facility which consists of a a 11 billion multicurrency term loan a facility b a 12 billion multicurrency term loan b facility and c a 700 million revolving credit facility additionally on october 3 2011 we completed an offering of 750 million aggregate principal amount of 8125 senior notes due 2019 and 750 million aggregate principal amount of 8375 senior notes due 2021 see note 11 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents 

 

 see “analysis of historical cash flows” below 

  

lines of credit 

effective october 3 2011 we terminated our former global credit facility and european credit facility and replaced them with the revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital needs and general corporate purposes including the payment of the amounts required upon effectiveness of the settlement agreement we did not use our former global credit facility and european credit facility in the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we used our credit facility for a short time period in connection with the acquisition of diversey interest paid for the year ended december 31 2011 under the revolving credit facility was immaterial there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2011 see note 11 “debt and credit facilities” for further details 

accounts receivable securitization program 

at december 31 2011 we had 92 million available to us under the program and we did not utilize this program in 2011 see note 8 “accounts receivable securitization program” for information concerning this program 

covenants 

at december 31 2011 we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations as discussed in “covenants” of note 11 “debt and credit facilities” 

debt ratings 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency 

 

 these credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade if our credit ratings are downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

outstanding indebtedness 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table see note 11 “debt and credit facilities” for further information on our debt 

 

 in the fourth quarter of 2011 we paid our required 2011 and prepaid our required 2012 term loan a facility and term loan b facility amortization payments these payments totaled approximately 97 million 

  

analysis of historical cash flow 

the following table shows the changes in our consolidated cash flows in the three years ended december 31 2011 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was primarily attributable to net earnings adjusted to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities of 387 million which primarily includes adjustments for depreciation and amortization costs related to the acquisition of diversey and sharebased incentive compensation expenses net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net source of cash of 6 million in 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was primarily attributable to net earnings adjusted to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities of 480 million which primarily includes adjustments for depreciation and amortization and sharebased incentive compensation expenses the changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash source of 3 million 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities in 2011 was primarily due to the acquisition of diversey see note 3 “acquisition of diversey holdings inc” for further information 

in 2010 we used net cash of 97 million for investing activities which was primarily due to capital expenditures of 88 million and the use of 24 million of cash for the completion of three business acquisitions and one equity investment in 2010 these investments were not material individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations partially offsetting these uses of cash in 2010 were cash proceeds of 13 million received from the sale of all of our auction rate security investments in 2010 

we expect to continue to invest capital as we deem appropriate to expand our business to maintain or replace depreciating property plant and equipment to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity and net sales growth as discussed in “2012 outlook” above we expect total capital expenditures in 2012 to be in the range 180 million to 190 million which includes capital expenditures of 20 million associated with the 20112014 integration and optimization program this projection is based upon our updated capital expenditure budget for 2012 the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects anticipated future projects and historic spending trends 

net cash provided by used in financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 partially offset by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 2010 

in 2010 we used 373 million of cash and cash equivalents for financing activities primarily due to the following activities 

 

   

  

  

 repurchases of capital stock 

we did not make any repurchases of our common stock in 2011 under our share repurchase program 

during 2010 we repurchased 04 million shares of our common stock par value 010 per share in open market purchases at a cost of 10 million the average price per share of these common stock repurchases was 2291 

we made the share repurchases in 2010 under the share repurchase program adopted by our board of directors in august 2007 under which the board of directors authorized us to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of our issued and outstanding common stock the program has no set expiration date and we may from time to time continue to repurchase our common stock see item 5 “issuer purchases of equity securities” for further information on the share repurchase program 

changes in working capital 

 

 the 287 million increase or 48 in working capital in the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to the following factors 

 

 partially offset by 

 

 changes in stockholders’ equity 

the 551 million or 23 increase in stockholders’ equity in 2011 compared with 2010 was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 these factors were partially offset by

foreign currency forward contracts 

at december 31 2011 we were party to foreign currency forward contracts which did not have a significant impact on our liquidity 

the information set forth in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” under the caption “foreign currency forward contracts” is incorporated herein by reference 

for further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of accounts receivable as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts which is included in marketing administrative and development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations these changes may reflect changes in economic business and market conditions the allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of chargeoffs net of recoveries 

the provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including but not limited to a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with our customers in circumstances where a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations is known we record a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount we reasonably assess will be collected if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to pay our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount 

fair value measurements of financial instruments 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 

 

  

   

 our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for further details on our fair value measurements 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability and we expect to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

impairment of longlived assets 

for definitelived intangible assets such as customer relationships contracts and intellectual property and for other longlived assets such as property plant and equipment whenever impairment indicators are present we perform a review for impairment we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount if the carrying amount is found to be greater we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value in addition in all cases of an impairment review we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate 

for indefinite – lived intangible assets such as inprocess research and development and trademarks and trade names each year and whenever impairment indicators are present we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value of fair value if any in addition in all cases of an impairment review other than for inprocess research and development assets we reevaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite –lived is appropriate 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment — the “component” level — discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment we must recognize a noncash impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value 

fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units assumptions for sales net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

  

income approach used to determine fair values 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis we use a discount rate that reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value longterm growth rates provisions for income taxes future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless debtfree working capital 

market approaches used to determine fair values 

each year we consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value including an approach referred to as the merger and acquisition method 

the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance these multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the company the third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publiclytraded and privatelyheld companies in the packaging industry 

the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include trailing and future 12month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied under the first and second market approaches a control premium or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

see note 7 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2011 and other related information 

pensions 

we maintain a qualified noncontributory profit sharing plan in which some us employees participate and qualified contributory retirement savings plans in which some us employees are eligible to participate for a number of our us employees and our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 

  

as a result of the acquisition of diversey we acquired diversey’s global pension and other postretirement benefit plans the assumed pension and postretirement benefits as of the acquisition date consisted of projected benefit obligations of 764 million and plan assets of 630 million at december 31 2011 the total projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans was 212 million and the total net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2011 was 2 million at december 31 2011 the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 929 million and the total net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2011 was 14 million 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2011 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2012 in millions 

 

  

  

  

 income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences tax benefit carry forwards and foreign tax credits we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

  

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 16 “income taxes” for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

at december 31 2011 we had outstanding interest rate swaps but no outstanding collars or options 

the information set forth in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of 111 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2011 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

operations 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

  

venezuela 

economic events in venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy under us gaap and the us dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela accordingly all bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured into us dollars using the then current exchange rate available to us and any changes in the exchange rate were reflected in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our venezuelan subsidiaries on the consolidated statement of operations 

as a result of the changes in the exchange rates upon settlement of bolivardenominated transactions and upon the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiaries’ financial statements we recognized nominal net losses for the year ended december 31 2011 and net gains of 6 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

for the year ended december 31 2011 less than 1 of our consolidated net sales were derived from our businesses in venezuela and approximately 2 of our consolidated operating profit was derived from our businesses in venezuela 

the potential future impact to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for bolivardenominated transactions will depend on our access to us dollars and on the exchange rates in effect when we enter into remeasure and settle transactions therefore it is difficult to predict the future impact until each transaction settles at its applicable exchange rate or gets remeasured into us dollars 

foreign currency forward contracts 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2011 would have caused us to pay approximately 61 million to terminate these contracts based on our overall foreign exchange exposure we estimate this change would not materially affect our financial position and liquidity the effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items   

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in part ii item 8 and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to certain financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2011 we had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 

outstanding debt 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 674 million at december 31 2011 and 26 million at december 31 2010

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

  

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 9 million in 2011 7 million in 2010 and 6 million in 2009 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 16 million at december 31 2011 and 17 million at december 31 2010 

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2011 we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately 21 million in 2012 see note 14 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and other chemicals and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

foreign operations 

 

we operate through our subsidiaries and have a presence in the united states and in the 51 other countries listed below enabling us to distribute our products in 77 countries 

 

 

 

in maintaining our foreign operations we face risks inherent in these operations such as currency fluctuations inflation and political instability information on currency exchange risk appears in part ii item 7a of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference other risks attendant to our foreign 

operations are set forth in part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference financial information showing net sales and total longlived assets by geographic region for each of the three years ended december 31 2010 appears in note 3 “segments” which information is incorporated herein by reference we maintain programs to comply with the various laws rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countries in which we operate see “environmental matters” below 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 16100 employees worldwide approximately 6800 of these employees were in the us with approximately 100 of these employees covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 9300 employees who were outside the us approximately 6300 were covered by collective bargaining agreements outside of the us many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 

 

marketing distribution and customers 

 

at december 31 2010 we employed approximately 2300 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers pharmaceutical companies medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers

to assist our marketing efforts for our protective packaging products and to provide specialized customer services we operate 35 industrial package design and development laboratories worldwide within our facilities these laboratories are staffed by professional packaging engineers and equipped with droptesting and other equipment used to develop and test costeffective package designs to meet the particular protective packaging requirements of each customer 

 

we operate five equipment design centers in three countries that focus on equipment and parts design and innovation to support the development of comprehensive systems solutions we also provide field technical services to our customers worldwide these services include system installation integration and monitoring systems repair and upgrade operator training in the efficient use of packaging systems qualification of various consumable and system combinations and packaging line layout and design 

 

our medical applications business offers two cleanroom contract assembly and packaging facilities in two countries as well as a packaging validation lab we also operate two equipment and medical device packaging labs in two countries that support customers’ package design needs and packaging equipment systems 

 

we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2010 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

 

seasonality 

 

historically net sales in our food businesses have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events our protective packaging segment has tended to also be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during the “backtoschool” season in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season 

competition 

 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership we invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year there are also other companies producing competing products that are wellestablished 

 

there are other manufacturers of food packaging and food solutions products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the united states 

 

our protective packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts and wood blocking and bracing systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products 

 

competition in specialty materials is focused on performance characteristics and price competition for most of our medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price technical design capability is an additional competitive factor for the rigid packaging offered by the medical applications business 

 

raw materials 

 

our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films and paper and wood pulp products these raw materials represent approximately onethird of our consolidated cost of goods sold we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap ® brand cushioning inks for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers 

 

the raw materials for our products generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several suppliers however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our business natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we source some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs 

 

sourcing 

 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes the centralized management of procurement and logistic activities our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve sourcing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent sourcing practices 

research and development activities 

 

we maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and improve our existing products and processes including developing new packaging and nonpackaging applications using our intellectual property from time to time we also acquire and commercialize new packaging and other products or techniques developed by others our research and development projects rely on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science package design and equipment engineering we spent 88 million in 2010 81 million in 2009 and 86 million in 2008 on research and development 

 

patents and trademarks 

 

we are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over 2500 united states and foreign patents and patent applications as well as an aggregate of over 3000 united states and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage as such each year we continue to file in the aggregate an average of 200 united states and foreign patent applications and 200 united states and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial position 

 

environmental health and safety matters 

 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which we operate these cover the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals the release of materials into the environment standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial position 

 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and more generally the sale or disposal of packaging materials in addition customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that incorporate renewable materials or that are otherwise viewed as being “environmentally sound” our new venture activities described above include the development of packaging products from renewable resources we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations to monitor their evolution and to meet this customer demand one advantage inherent in many of our products is that thin lightweight packaging solutions reduce waste and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives we continue to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they become available 

 

we also support our customers’ interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of our products or product packaging and for materials used in some of our products when possible materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in our protective packaging operations or offered to other manufacturers for use in other products in addition gains that we have made in internal recycling programs have allowed us to improve our net raw material yield thus mitigating the impact of resin costs while lowering solid waste disposal costs and controlling environmental liability risks associated with waste disposal 

 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees for which we are recognized as leaders in our industry our website wwwsealedaircom contains additional detailed information about our corporate citizenship initiatives

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

introduction 

 

investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors however they are not the only risk factors that you should consider in making an investment decision 

 

this annual report on form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference from our proxy statement for our 2011 annual meeting of stockholders or from exhibits forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the “cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements” below our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including the risks that we face which are described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in documents incorporated by reference in this report 

 

our business consolidated financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

 

weakened global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

weakened global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or lower profit margins 

 

during periods of economic recession there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated revenue profitability and cash flows 

 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this also could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

 

the global nature of our operations in the united states and in 51 foreign countries exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

we operate in the united states and in 51 other countries and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the united states operations outside of the united states particularly operations in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

 

risks inherent in our international operations include social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions exchange controls foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations including devaluations the potential for changes in local economic conditions including local inflationary pressures restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters including antidumping duties tariffs embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures changes in laws and regulations 

including the laws and policies of the united states affecting trade and foreign investment the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities and unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against united states or other interests in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

if the settlement of the asbestosrelated claims that we have agreed to the “settlement agreement” is not implemented we will not be released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with w r grace  co we are also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from w r grace  co’s activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the “acc” and the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the w r grace  co “grace” bankruptcy case to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates the settlement agreement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction the cryovac transaction was a multistep transaction completed on march 31 1998 which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air corporation’s business under the common ownership of the company the parties to the agreement in principle signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware where the grace bankruptcy case is pending signed an order approving the definitive settlement agreement although grace is not a party to the settlement agreement under the terms of the order grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions on september 19 2008 grace the acc the asbestos pi future claimants’ representative the “fcr” and the official committee of equity security holders the “equity committee” filed as coproponents a plan of reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the “pi settlement plan” and several exhibits and associated documents including a disclosure statement as filed and amended from time to time the “pi settlement disclosure statement” with the bankruptcy court as filed the pi settlement plan would provide for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the united states bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated claims would be channeled the pi settlement plan also contemplates that the terms of our definitive settlement agreement will be incorporated into the pi settlement plan and that we will pay the amount contemplated by that agreement 

 

on january 31 2011 the bankruptcy court entered a memorandum opinion the “memorandum opinion” overruling certain objections to the pi settlement plan on the same date the bankruptcy court entered an order regarding confirmation of the pi settlement plan the “confirmation order” as entered on january 31 2011 the confirmation order contained recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended that the us district court for the district of delaware the “district court” approve the confirmation order and that the district court confirm the pi settlement plan and issue a channeling injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code thereafter on february 15 2011 the bankruptcy court issued an order clarifying its memorandum opinion and confirmation order the “clarifying order” among other things the clarifying order provided that any references in the memorandum opinion and confirmation order to a recommendation that the district court confirm the pi settlement plan were thereby amended to make clear that the pi settlement plan was confirmed and that the bankruptcy court was requesting that the district court issue and affirm the confirmation order including the injunction under section 524g of the bankruptcy code 

 

if it becomes effective the pi settlement plan may implement the terms of the settlement agreement but there can be no assurance that this will be the case notwithstanding the bankruptcy court’s confirmation of the pi settlement plan the terms of the pi settlement plan remain subject to amendment moreover the pi settlement plan is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions which are more fully set forth in the pi settlement plan 

and include without limitation the availability of exit financing and the approval of the pi settlement plan by the district court additionally various parties have filed notices of appeal or have otherwise challenged the memorandum opinion and confirmation order and the pi settlement plan may be subject to further appeal or challenge by additional parties parties filed a number of objections to the pi settlement plan and some of these objections concerned injunctions releases and provisions as applied to us andor that are contemplated by the settlement agreement such parties or others may appeal or otherwise challenge the bankruptcy court’s memorandum opinion and confirmation order or otherwise continue to oppose the pi settlement plan 

 

while the bankruptcy court has confirmed the pi settlement plan additional proceedings may be held before the district court or other courts to consider matters related to the pi settlement plan we do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization will become effective assuming that a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court approved by the district court and does become effective we do not know whether the final plan of reorganization will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement and if the other conditions to our obligation to pay the settlement agreement amount will be met if these conditions are not satisfied or not waived by us we will not be obligated to pay the amount contemplated by the settlement agreement however if we do not pay the settlement agreement amount we and our affiliates will not be released from the various claims against us 

 

if the settlement agreement does not become effective either because grace fails to emerge from bankruptcy or because grace does not emerge from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement then we and our affiliates will not be released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us and our affiliates noted above and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to be resolved through other means such as through agreement on alternative settlement terms or trials in that case we could face liabilities that are significantly different from our obligations under the settlement agreement we cannot estimate at this time what those differences or their magnitude may be in the event these liabilities are materially larger than the current existing obligations they could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

since november 2004 the company and specified subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of grace’s alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestos containing products in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace has agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases the canadian cases are currently stayed a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by grace has been approved by the canadian court and the pi settlement plan provides for payment of these claims we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us will become operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in grace’s united states chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the pi settlement plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code by its terms the canadian settlement will unless amended become null and void if a confirmation order in the grace us bankruptcy proceeding is not granted prior to july 31 2011 as indicated above the bankruptcy court entered the confirmation order on january 31 2011 and the clarifying order on february 15 2011 however we can give no assurance that the pi settlement plan or any other plan of reorganization will be approved by the district court or will become effective assuming that a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court approved by the district court and does become effective if the final plan of reorganization does not incorporate the terms of the canadian settlement or if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay substantial damages which we cannot estimate at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

for further information concerning these matters see note 16 “commitments and contingencies” of notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” 

a downgrade of our credit ratings could have a negative impact on our costs and ability to access credit markets 

 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically the company and our longterm senior unsecured debt are currently rated bb positive outlook by standard  poor’s financial services llc on november 18 2010 standard  poor’s revised our ratings outlook to positive from stable this rating is considered noninvestment grade the company and our longterm senior unsecured debt are currently rated baa3 by moody’s investor service inc this rating is considered investment grade on may 4 2010 moody’s revised our ratings outlook to stable from negative if our credit ratings are downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemicalbased raw materials and energy could increase our costs we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

 

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as “mad cow” disease footandmouth disease and avian influenza or “birdflu” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products in recent years occasional cases of mad cow disease have been confirmed and incidents of bird flu have surfaced in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food businesses’ products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

concerns about greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials and freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits it is also possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our global credit facility our european credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program as described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which is included in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k our accounts receivable securitization program includes a bank financing commitment that must be renewed annually prior to the expiration date the bank commitment is scheduled to expire on december 2 2011 while the bank is not obligated to renew the bank financing commitment we have negotiated annual renewals since the commencement of the program in 2001 

 

additionally conditions in financial markets could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under our global credit facility or the european credit facility may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

 

covenant restrictions under our credit arrangements may pose a risk 

 

we have a number of credit facilities including our global credit facility our european credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program and debt securities we have issued to manage liquidity and fund operations as described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which is included in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k the agreements relating to these facilities and securities generally contain certain restrictive covenants including the incurrence of additional indebtedness restriction of liens and sale and leaseback transactions financial covenants relating to interest coverage debt leverage and minimum liquidity and restrictions on consolidation and merger transactions as well as in some cases restrictions on amendments to the settlement agreement in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization program can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience as a result of some of these factors the amount available to us under the program has decreased although we do not believe that any of these covenants or other restrictive provisions presently materially restricts our liquidity position a breach of one or more of the covenants or an event that triggers other restrictive provisions could result in material adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business consolidated results of operations and financial position this in turn could result in a further decline in amounts available under the accounts receivable securitization program or termination of the program such adverse consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering the obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders or the bank commitment related to our accounts receivable securitization program refusal by lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings 

 

strengthening of the us dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

during 2010 approximately 54 of our sales originated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 

 

also while we often produce in the same geographic markets as our products are sold expenses are more concentrated in the united states compared with sales so that in a time of strengthening of the us dollar our profit margins could be reduced while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from foreign currency effects 

 

we have recognized foreign exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america or us gaap effective january 1 2010 see “foreign currency exchange rate risk” of item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion 

we may use financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” for further discussion which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets including primarily those related to the settlement agreement may be affected by a number of factors 

 

we have deferred tax assets related to the settlement agreement other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends in part upon our future operating results we expect to realize these assets over an extended period consequently changes in tax laws could cause actual results to differ from projections 

 

our largest deferred tax asset relates to our settlement agreement the value of this asset which was 368 million at december 31 2010 may be affected by our tax situation at the time of the payment under the settlement agreement as well as by the value of our common stock at that time the deferred tax asset reflects the fair market value of 18 million shares of our common stock at a postsplit price of 1786 per share based on the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 see note 15 “income taxes” for further discussion 

 

our annual effective income tax rate can materially change as a result of changes in our us and foreign mix of earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes by regulatory authorities 

 

our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis changes in statutory tax rates and laws as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us for example legislative proposals to change us taxation of nonus earnings could increase our effective tax rate also changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate 

 

we experience competition in our operating segments and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

 

our products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are wellestablished our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes which would have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

a slowing pipeline of new technologies and solutions at favorable margins could adversely affect our performance and prospects for future growth 

 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales expectations or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to i accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards ii resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner or iii achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business 

 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a tornado hurricane earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

the price of our common stock has on occasion experienced significant price and volume fluctuations the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock one stockholder has beneficial ownership of approximately 32 of our common shares 

 

the market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations greater than those experienced by the broader stock market in addition our announcements of our quarterly net earnings future developments relating to the w r grace  co bankruptcy litigation the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues spikes in raw material and energy related costs changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us our customers suppliers and competitors are among the events that could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 

 

the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the price of the common stock the settlement agreement discussed above provides for the issuance of 18 million shares of our common stock if this amount of common stock were to be sold in a relatively short period of trading the sale could adversely affect the price of our common stock see note 16 “commitments and contingencies” under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” for further discussion 

 

according to a schedule 13ga filed with the sec on february 14 2011 davis selected advisers lp reported beneficial ownership of 51458302 shares or approximately 32 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as such davis selected advisers has a significant voting block with respect to matters submitted to a stockholder vote including the election of directors and the approval of potential business combination transactions 

 

while the schedule 13ga filed by davis selected advisers lp indicates that the beneficially owned shares of our common stock were not acquired for the purpose of changing or influencing the control of the company if this stockholder were to change its purpose for holding our common stock from investment to attempting to change or influence our management this concentration of our common stock could potentially affect us and the price of our common stock 

 

weakness in the financial and credit markets and other factors could potentially lead to the impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other longlived assets 

 

we have seven reporting units that are included in our segment reporting structure the six reporting units with goodwill balances allocated to them are food packaging food solutions protective packaging shrink packaging specialty materials and medical applications 

 

we test goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually during the fourth quarter of each year and at other times if events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable during 2010 we determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that occurred that would indicate that the fair value of any of our reporting units may be below its carrying value 

 

although we determined in 2010 that there were no events or changes in circumstances that occurred that would indicate that the fair value of any of our reporting units may be below its carrying value the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment such as i a decrease in our expected net earnings ii adverse equity market conditions iii a decline in current market multiples iv a decline in our common stock price v a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates vi an adverse action or assessment by a regulator vii heightened competition viii strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or ix a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of could require an interim assessment for some or all of the reporting units before the next required annual assessment in the event of significant adverse changes of the nature described above we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

 

our subsidiaries hold substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations and as a result we rely on distributions or advances from our subsidiaries 

 

we conduct substantially all of our business through two direct whollyowned subsidiaries cryovac inc and sealed air corporation us these two subsidiaries directly and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of our business and conduct operations themselves and through other subsidiaries around the globe therefore we depend on distributions or advances from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends with respect to shares of our common stock contractual provisions laws or regulations to which we or any of our subsidiaries may become subject tax inefficiencies and the financial condition and operating requirements of subsidiaries may reduce funds available for service of our indebtedness dividends and general corporate purposes

other property information 

 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the united states and in many foreign countries some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some on those that we lease standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters are located in a leased property in elmwood park new jersey for a list of those countries outside of the united states where we have operations see “foreign operations” above our website wwwsealedaircom  contains additional information about our worldwide business

 item 3   legal proceedings tableend  

the information set forth in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k in note 16 “commitments and contingencies” under the caption “cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies” is incorporated herein by reference 

 

at december 31 2010 we were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of “superfund” sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental 

cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2010 environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

as of january 31 2011 there were approximately 6200 holders of record of our common stock 

 

dividends 

 

currently there are no restrictions that materially limit our ability to pay dividends or that we reasonably believe are likely to materially limit the future payment of dividends on our common stock 

 

the following table shows our total cash dividends paid each year since we initiated quarterly cash dividend payments in 2006 

 

 

 

on february 17 2011 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 013 per common share payable on march 18 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 4 2011 the estimated amount of this dividend payment is 21 million based on 159 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of january 31 2011 

 

the dividend payments discussed above are recorded as reductions to cash and cash equivalents and retained earnings on our consolidated balance sheets from time to time we may consider other means of returning value to our stockholders based on our consolidated financial position and results of operations there is no guarantee that our board of directors will declare any further dividends 

 

common stock performance comparisons 

 

the following graph shows for the five years ended december 31 2010 the cumulative total return on an investment of 100 assumed to have been made on december 31 2005 in our common stock the graph compares this return “see” with that of comparable investments assumed to have been made on the same date in a the standard  poor’s 500 stock index “composite sp 500” b a prior selfconstructed peer group “peer group 1” and c an updated selfconstructed peer group “peer group 2”

in 2010 we revised our peer group and designated it peer group 2 which will replace peer group 1 beginning january 1 2011 we decided to utilize peer group 2 rather than peer group 1 because we believe that peer group 2 more closely represents public companies in packaging and related industries that are comparable to us based on sales total assets numbers of employees and market capitalization further the organization and compensation committee of our board of directors or compensation committee will use this peer group to benchmark executive compensation going forward 

 

the updated peer group 2 includes us and the following companies avery dennison corporation ball corporation bemis company inc crown holdings inc greif inc meadwestvaco corporation owensillinois inc packaging corporation of america pactiv corporation for 2005 through 2009 rocktenn company rockwood holdings inc silgan holdings inc sonoco products co and templeinland inc

in our “2011 outlook” below we present anticipated full year 2011 diluted net earnings per common share on a us gaap basis but we also note that we will exclude any nonoperating gains or losses that may be recognized in 2011 related to currency fluctuations in venezuela we believe these gains or losses are attributable to the significant foreign exchange fluctuations in that country and are not indicative of a normal operating environment we will exclude future foreign exchange and other nonoperating gains and or losses from our nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings per common share relating to our venezuelan subsidiary until such time that we believe the foreign exchange environment in venezuela stabilizes we believe that excluding these items from our us gaap reported and projected net earnings performance will aid in the comparison of our adjusted net earnings performance between 2011 and prior years 

 

we also present adjusted diluted net earnings per common share in our “highlights of financial performance” below for the three years ended december 31 2010 our management will look at our earnings performance both on an us gaap basis and on a nonus gaap basis our nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings performance excludes unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis our evaluation of whether to exclude an item for purposes of determining our nonus gaap net earnings performance considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item including among other things i its size and nature ii whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations and iii whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis for purposes of determining nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings performance restructuring and other charges and their related tax effect are excluded further the items excluded from nonus gaap adjusted basis may also be excluded from the calculations of our performance measures set by the compensation committee for purposes of determining incentive compensation thus our management believes that this information may be useful to investors 

 

in our “highlights of financial performance” “net sales by segment reporting structure” “net sales by geographic region” and elsewhere below we first present our results in accordance with us gaap and also present a nonus gaap financial measure “adjusted diluted net earnings per common share” also in some of the discussions and tables that follow we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information which we define as “constant dollar” changes in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation are nonus gaap financial measures as a worldwide business it is important that we take into account the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies nonetheless we cannot directly control changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently when our management looks at net sales to measure the performance of our business we typically exclude the impact of foreign currency translation from net sales we also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations as a result our management believes that these presentations may be useful to investors 

overview 

 

beginning with the invention of bubble wrap ® brand cushioning over fifty years ago we have been a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and performancebased materials and equipment systems that serve an array of food industrial medical and consumer applications 

 

at december 31 2010 we employed approximately 2300 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products through a large number of distributors fabricators and converters as well as directly to endusers such as food processors foodservice businesses supermarket retailers and manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2010 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

 

historically net sales in our food businesses have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events our protective packaging segment has also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during the “backtoschool” season in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season 

 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and as a result we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership for more details see “competition” included in “business” of item 1 part i 

 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary materially with changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs primarily resin costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

 

we manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to modify our capital structure as the need or opportunity arises and return capital to our stockholders 

 

2011 outlook 

 

in 2011 we are anticipating an ongoing modest rate of economic recovery and an average constant dollar sales growth rate in the 5 to 7 range presently our full year 2011 guidance also assumes 

 

  

as a result we anticipate our full year 2011 diluted net earnings guidance to be in the range of 175 to 190 

 

our guidance excludes the payment under the settlement agreement as the exact timing of the settlement payment is unknown although it is possible that payment could occur in the first half of 2011 payment of the settlement agreement is expected to be accretive to our net earnings by approximately 012 to 014 per diluted share annually following the payment date this impact assumes using a substantial portion of available cash to fund the payment and ceasing to accrue interest on the settlement liability see “settlement agreement and related 

costs” of “material commitments and contingencies” below for further discussion additionally our guidance excludes any nonoperating gains or losses that may be recognized in 2011 due to currency fluctuations in venezuela 

 

in addition capital expenditures in 2011 are estimated to be 150 to 175 million 

 

significant 2010 events 

 

quarterly cash dividends 

 

in july 2010 our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 8 to 013 per common share from 012 per common share we used cash of 80 million to pay quarterly dividends in 2010 during 2009 we paid quarterly cash dividends of 012 per common share using 76 million of available cash 

 

on february 17 2011 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 013 per common share payable on march 18 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 4 2011 the estimated amount of this dividend payment is 21 million based on 159 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of january 31 2011 

 

early redemption of debt 

 

in december 2010 we completed an early redemption of 150 million of our outstanding 300 million principal amount of our 12 senior notes due 2014 we redeemed the notes at 127 of the principal amount plus accrued interest the aggregate redemption price was 196 million which was funded with available cash because of the redemption we recognized a pretax loss of 39 million see “loss on debt redemption” below for further discussion 

 

completion of global manufacturing strategy 

 

in 2010 we recognized approximately 8 million of restructuring and other associated charges related to our gms program which marked the completion of this program as a result of the program we have repositioned our supply chain platform for more profitable growth in developing regions while concurrently realigning our core manufacturing sites to improve operating efficiency and realizing an annual 55 million benefit run rate 

 

common stock repurchases 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we repurchased 04 million shares of our common stock using approximately 10 million of available cash 

highlights of financial performance 

 

below are the highlights of our financial performance for the three years ended december 31 2010 

 

 

 

as shown in the table above our diluted net earnings per common share increased 7 in 2010 compared with 2009 the primary contributing factors to our diluted net earnings per common share growth in 2010 compared with 2009 were 

 

  

these factors were partially offset by an increase in nonoperating items of 29 million primarily due to the loss on debt redemption of 39 million in 2010 compared with 3 million in 2009 

 

on an adjusted basis excluding the items detailed in “diluted net earnings per common share” below our diluted net earnings per common share increased 11 to 160 in 2010 from 144 in 2009 a reconciliation of us gaap diluted net earnings per common share to nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings per common share is included in “diluted net earnings per common share” below 

 

see the discussions below for further details about the material factors that contributed to the changes in our net earnings for the three years ended december 31 2010

2009 compared with 2008 

 

 

 

foreign currency translation impact on net sales 

 

as shown above more than 50 of our consolidated net sales are generated outside the us approximately 20 of our consolidated net sales are eurodenominated since we are a us company we translate our foreign currency denominated net sales into us dollars due to the strengthening and weakening in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar the translation of our net sales from foreign currencies to us dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact on our consolidated net sales 

 

in 2010 we experienced a favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of 70 million compared with 2009 due to the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the us dollar this impact includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 18 million in the second half of 2010 as the us dollar began to strengthen against most foreign currencies 

 

in 2009 we experienced an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of 242 million compared with 2008 due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to most foreign currencies this impact includes a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 49 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as most foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar 

 

components of change in net sales 

 

the following tables present the components of change in net sales by our segment reporting structure for 2010 compared with 2009 and 2009 compared with 2008 we also present the change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation a nonus gaap measure which we define as “constant dollar” we believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability between periods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

the following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis 

 

food packaging segment net sales 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

the 34 million or 2 increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to 

 

  

partially offset by 

 

  

the higher unit volumes in north america and in latin america were mostly due to an increase in our customers’ beef production rates resulting in higher demand for most of our packaging formats 

 

the unfavorable impact of product pricemix in north america was primarily due to selectively lower pricing associated with higher customer volume commitments which offset the benefits of our price increases and formula contract adjustments in the year the unfavorable impact of product pricemix in the latin american region was primarily due to the volatility of the venezuelan currency as discussed above 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the 9 million or 1 decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to 

 

  

partially offset by 

 

 31 

 

the decrease in unit volume in europe was primarily due to lower equipment sales which we believe was mostly the result of lower capital spending by customers in this region the decrease in unit volume in the united states was primarily due to the decline in local meat production mostly experienced during the first nine months of 2009 the unit volume declines in europe and the united states reflected the continuing economic weakness in these regions the favorable impact of product pricemix in latin america was primarily due to the timing of pricing actions on most food packaging products in part to cover the weakness of the venezuelan currency 

 

food solutions segment net sales 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

the 30 million or 4 increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to 

 

  

these factors were partially offset by a decline in product pricemix in europe of 5 million or 2 primarily due to the timing of price adjustments for changes in resin costs experienced in the first half of 2010 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the 39 million or 4 decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to decreases in unit volume in europe of 29 million or 7 and in north america of 13 million or 3 the decrease in unit volume in europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of reduced consumption of certain meats in some countries which in turn resulted in lower sales of our caseready packaging products the decrease in north america was primarily due to lower sales of our vertical pouch packaging products to customers in the foodservice sector the unit volume decreases in europe and north america reflected the economic weakness in these regions 

 

outsourced products 

 

in addition to net sales from products produced in our facilities net trade sales in this segment were also attributable to the sale of products fabricated by other manufacturers which we refer to as “outsourced products” outsourced products include among others foam and solid plastic trays and containers fabricated primarily in north america and in europe that largely support our case ready products we have strategically opted to use thirdparty manufacturers for technically less complex products and selected equipment in order to offer customers a broader range of solutions in each of the three years ended december 31 2010 outsourced products represented approximately 17 of food solutions net sales 

 

we have benefited from this strategy with increased net sales and operating profit requiring minimal capital expenditures net sales of outsourced products included in this segment amounted to 159 million in 2010 150 million in 2009 and 170 million in 2008 in addition we had sales of 119 million in 2010 90 million in 2009 and 70 million in 2008 from the sales of outsourced products in our other segments primarily our protective packaging segment 

 

protective packaging segment net sales 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

the 96 million or 8 increase in net sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily the result of higher unit volumes in north america of 60 million or 9 in europe of 24 million or 7 and in the asia pacific region of 17 million or 13 these increases were principally attributable to improving economic conditions in these regions which were consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends also contributing to the higher unit volumes to a lesser extent was strength in fulfillmentecommerce applications 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the 238 million or 16 decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit volume in north america of 115 million or 14 and in europe of 70 million or 16 these declines were principally attributable to continuing economic weakness in these regions which were consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends 

 

other net sales 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

 

the 17 million or 5 increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily attributed to higher unit volumes in north america of 12 million or 11 and in europe of 16 million or 11 these increases were primarily attributed to higher unit volumes for some of our specialty materials products which were principally the result of improving economic conditions in these regions consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends partially offsetting these factors was lower unit volumes in our medical applications business in asia of 13 million or 38 primarily due to the impact of an april 2010 licensing expiration in china late in the third quarter of 2010 our license was renewed 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the 73 million or 18 decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily attributed to lower unit volumes in north america of 44 million or 29 and in europe of 27 million or 14 these declines were primarily attributed to lower unit volumes for some of our specialty materials products which were principally the result of continuing economic weakness in these regions consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends 

 

cost of sales 

 

our primary input costs include resins direct and indirect labor other raw materials and other input costs including energyrelated costs and transportation costs we utilize petrochemicalbased resins in the manufacture of many of our products the costs for these raw materials are impacted by the rise and fall in crude oil and natural gas prices since they serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of most resins the prices for these feedstocks have been particularly volatile in recent years as a result of changes in global demand in addition supply and demand imbalances of intermediate compounds such as benzene and supplier facility outages also impacted resin costs although changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks they are indicative of the variations in raw materials and other input costs we face we continue to monitor changes in raw material and energyrelated costs as they occur and take pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases when they occur 

 

in this cost of sales section and in the marketing administrative and development expenses section below when we refer to “variable incentive compensation” we are referring to our annual us profit sharing contribution in both sections and our annual cash incentive compensation in the marketing administrative and development expenses section variable incentive compensation does not include our sharebased incentive compensation programs details about our sharebased incentive compensation programs are included in note 17 “stockholders’ equity” 

 

cost of sales for the three years ended december 31 2010 was as follows 

 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

the 213 million increase in cost of sales in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to 

 

  

the factors above that drove the increase in cost of sales in 2010 compared with 2009 were partially offset by our supply chain productivity improvements including lower headcount in 2010 compared with 2009 despite higher unit volumes and by the benefits of producing products in our new lowcost facilities in developing regions 

 

also partially offsetting the increase in cost of sales was lower variable incentive compensation expenses of 6 million in 2010 compared with 2009 because we did not meet some of our 2010 financial performance goals 

 

expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of gms were 4 million in 2010 compared with 10 million in 2009 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the 583 million decrease in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to 

 

  

expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of gms were 10 million in 2009 compared with 7 million in 2008 

 

marketing administrative and development expenses 

 

marketing administrative and development expenses for the three years ended december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

marketing administrative and development expenses decreased 9 million in 2010 compared with 2009 these expenses decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses of approximately 30 million in 2010 primarily because we did not meet some of our 2010 financial performance goals see the table below for further details 

this factor was partially offset by 

 

  

our variable incentive compensation expense includes annual cash incentives and our annual us profit sharing contribution we also have longterm sharebased incentive compensation that is included in marketing administrative and development expenses the table below shows the year over year changes in these expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

2009 compared with 2008 

 

marketing administrative and development expenses decreased 36 million in 2009 compared with 2008 these expenses decreased due to the following 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expenses including longterm sharebased incentive compensation of approximately 39 million in 2009 of which approximately 30 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 because we exceeded our 2009 financial performance goals but did not meet our 2008 financial performance goals 

 

the table below shows the year over year changes in incentive compensation expenses in 2009 compared with 2008

restructuring activities 

 

global manufacturing strategy 

 

we announced our global manufacturing strategy program in 2006 and completed the program in 2010 the goals of this multiyear program were to realign our manufacturing footprint to expand capacity in growing markets to further improve our operating efficiencies and to implement new technologies more effectively additionally we optimized certain manufacturing platforms in north america and europe into centers of excellence by taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale we have continued to enhance our profitable growth and our global leadership position and have produced meaningful benefits 

 

at the inception of this multiyear program we projected cumulative capital expenditures and related costs to implement this program to be approximately 220 million the actual amount was 235 million a substantial portion of the difference between the projected amount and the actual amount of capital expenditures and related costs was due to foreign currency translation 

 

the capital expenditures associated costs and related restructuring charges and the total amounts incurred since inception of this multiyear program are included in the table below these associated costs and restructuring and other charges have been excluded from our nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings per common share see “diluted net earnings per common share” below for further details 

 

 

 

we estimate that we realized approximately 25 million in benefits in 2008 which increased to 45 million in 2009 and increased further to 55 million in 2010 these benefits are primarily realized in cost of sales 

 

european facility closure 

 

in december 2010 we informed affected employees that we would be closing a small shrink packaging factory in europe we are taking this action based on our review of operating costs and technology levels in an effort to simplify our plant network and improve our operating efficiency we recorded associated costs and restructuring and other charges of 7 million in 2010 we will record the remaining costs of approximately 1 to 2 million in future years mostly in 2011 

 

these associated costs and restructuring and other charges related to this action have been excluded from our nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings per common share see “diluted net earnings per common share” below for further details 

 

see note 4 “restructuring activities” for additional information on gms and our other recent restructuring activities 

operating profit 

 

management evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on its operating profit operating profit by our segment reporting structure for the three years ended december 31 2010 was as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

see “restructuring activities” above for further discussion of restructuring activities 

 

food packaging segment operating profit 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

the increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impact of the increase in unit volumes mentioned above also contributing to this segment’s increase in operating profit were lower marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales which include the impact of lower variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above these factors were partially offset by higher average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 51 million 

 

expenses in this segment related to the implementation of gms were 3 million in 2010 compared with 8 million in 2009 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 80 million and the favorable impact of product pricemix of 46 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately 16 million operating profit was also favorably impacted by benefits from gms and our expense control initiatives and other cost control 

measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above these items were partially offset by the decline in unit volumes discussed above 

 

expenses in this segment related to the implementation of gms were 8 million in 2009 compared with 4 million in 2008 

 

food solutions segment operating profit 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

the increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impacts of the increase in unit volumes and product pricemix both mentioned above also contributing to this segment’s increase in operating profit were lower marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales which include the impact of lower variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above these factors were partially offset by higher average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 30 million 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 40 million and lower freight and utilities costs of approximately 7 million operating profit was also favorably impacted by benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above these items were partially offset by the decline in unit volume discussed above 

 

protective packaging segment operating profit 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

the increase in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the favorable impact of the increase in unit volumes mentioned above also contributing to this segment’s increase in operating profit were lower marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales which include the impact of lower variable incentive compensation expenses mentioned above these factors were partially offset by higher average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 35 million expenses included in this segment’s operating profit related to the closure of a small factory in europe were 3 million in 2010 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the decline in unit volumes and unfavorable product pricemix both discussed above these items were partially offset by favorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 60 million and lower freight and utilities costs of approximately 30 million operating profit was also favorably impacted by benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above 

 

other operating profit 

 

2010 compared with 2009 

 

the decrease in operating profit in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 14 million also contributing to the decline in operating profit were incremental expenses related to our new ventures these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of the increase in unit volumes mentioned above 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

 

the decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the decline in unit volumes in our specialty materials products discussed above partially offsetting this decline were favorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 20 million favorable product pricemix of approximately 9 million and favorable freight and utilities costs of approximately 7 million 

interest expense 

 

interest expense includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt as well as the net impact of capitalized interest the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs bond discounts and terminated treasury locks 

 

interest expense for the three years ended december 31 2010 was as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

gains on sale otherthantemporary impairment of availableforsale securities 

 

in 2010 we sold our five auction rate security investments representing our total holdings of these securities these sales resulted in a pretax gain of 7 million 4 million net of taxes before we sold these investments we recognized 1 million of pretax otherthantemporary impairment in 2010 due to the decline in estimated fair value of some of these investments 

 

our valuation of our auction rate security investments resulted in the recognition of otherthantemporary impairment of 4 million 2 million net of taxes in 2009 and 34 million 22 million net of taxes in 2008 

 

the gains and losses associated with our auction rate security investments have been excluded from our nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings per common share see “diluted net earnings per common share” below for further details 

 

see note 5 “availableforsale investments” for further discussion 

 

foreign currency exchange losses gains related to venezuelan subsidiary 

 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy the foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2010 for our venezuelan subsidiary were the result of two factors 1 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to settle bolivardenominated transactions and 2 the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements at the balance sheet date we believe these gains and losses are attributable to an unpredictable foreign currency environment in 

venezuela as a result we have excluded these gains and losses and we will exclude future nonoperating gains andor losses relating to our venezuelan subsidiary from our nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings per common share until such time that we believe the foreign exchange environment in venezuela stabilizes see “venezuela” in “foreign exchange rates” of item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion on venezuela 

 

loss on debt redemption 

 

in december 2010 we completed an early redemption of 150 million of the outstanding 300 million principal amount of our 12 senior notes due february 14 2014 we redeemed the notes at 127 of the principal amount plus accrued interest the aggregate redemption price was 196 million including 5 million of accrued interest we funded the redemption with available cash we recorded a pretax loss of 41 million resulting from the 27 premium we also recognized a gain of 2 million from the termination of a related interest rate swap as a result the total net pretax loss was 39 million which equated to a 014 per common share decrease to our reported diluted net earnings per common share the annual pretax interest expense savings from this redemption is 18 million which equates to 006 per diluted common share beginning in december 2010 through february 2014 

 

in 2009 we redeemed the entire 4313 million of our 3 convertible senior notes due 2033 and recorded a 3 million pretax loss this loss represented a 0429 call premium of 2 million and a writedown of the remaining debt issuance costs of 1 million related to the issuance of these senior notes in july 2003 

 

the losses associated with our debt redemptions have been excluded from our nonus gaap adjusted diluted net earnings per common share see “diluted net earnings per common share” below for further details 

 

other expense net 

 

see note 19 “other expense net” for the components and discussion of other expense net 

 

income taxes 

 

our effective income tax rate was 255 for 2010 259 for 2009 and 191 for 2008 as described below in each of those years we recognized benefits for items that may not recur to the same extent in future years as such we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 27 for 2011 our 2011 effective tax rate may be higher if we fund the settlement agreement in 2011 we anticipate that funding the settlement agreement in 2011 will result in a loss for us income tax return purposes this loss will eliminate some tax benefits in 2011 primarily the domestic manufacturing deduction 

 

for 2010 our effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings as well as income tax benefits from tax credits and the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state income taxes 

 

our 2009 effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate for the same reasons as in 2010 except that the benefits were offset by an increase in accruals relating to uncertain tax positions 

 

see note 15 “income taxes” for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate which also shows the major components of the year over year changes 

diluted net earnings per common share

we recorded a pretax charge of 8501 million in 2002 of which 5125 million represents a cash payment that we are required to make subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of wr grace  co we did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability 

 

we currently expect to fund a substantial portion of this payment when it becomes due by using accumulated cash and cash equivalents with the remainder from our committed credit facilities our global credit facility and european credit facility are available for general corporate purposes including the payment of the amounts required upon effectiveness of the settlement agreement see “principal sources of liquidity” below the cash payment of 

5125 million accrues interest at a 55 annual rate which is compounded annually from december 21 2002 to the date of payment this accrued interest was 275 million at december 31 2010 and is recorded in settlement agreement and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheet the total liability on our consolidated balance sheet was 788 million at december 31 2010 in addition the settlement agreement provides for the issuance of 18 million shares of our common stock since the impact of issuing these shares is dilutive under us gaap they have been included in our calculation of diluted net earnings per common share for all periods presented 

 

tax benefits resulting from the payment made under the settlement agreement which are currently recorded as deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets are anticipated to provide approximately 370 million of current and future cash tax benefits these deferred tax assets reflect the cash portion of the settlement agreement and related accrued interest and the fair market value of the 18 million shares of our common stock at a postsplit price of 1786 per share which was the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 the amount and timing of future cash tax benefits could vary depending on the amount of cash paid by us and various facts and circumstances at the time of payment under the settlement agreement including the price of our common stock our tax position and the applicable tax codes any changes in the tax benefits resulting from an increase in our stock price in excess of the 1786 share price mentioned above will not have an impact on our net earnings 

 

additionally we may incur an approximate one percentage point increase in our effective income tax rate during the calendar year in which we make the payment under the settlement we anticipate that funding the settlement agreement will result in a loss for us income tax purposes and this loss will eliminate some tax benefits for that year primarily the domestic manufacturing deduction 

 

while the bankruptcy court has confirmed the pi settlement plan additional proceedings may be held before the district court or other courts to consider matters related to the pi settlement plan additionally various parties have filed notices of appeal or have otherwise challenged the memorandum opinion and confirmation order and the pi settlement plan may be subject to further appeal or challenge by additional parties parties filed a number of objections to the pi settlement plan and some of these objections concerned injunctions releases and provisions as applied to us andor that are contemplated by the settlement agreement such parties or others may appeal or otherwise challenge the bankruptcy court’s memorandum opinion and confirmation order or otherwise continue to oppose the pi settlement plan we do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement 

 

as mentioned in “2011 outlook” above our full year 2011 diluted net earnings per common share guidance continues to exclude the payment under the settlement agreement as the timing is unknown payment under the settlement agreement is expected to be accretive to our postpayment diluted net earnings per common share by approximately 012 to 014 annually this range primarily represents the accretive impact on our net earnings from ceasing to accrue any future interest on the settlement amount following the payment

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2011 and future years amounts in millions 

 

 

 

 

  

current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt  — the debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of december 31 2010 and therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period 

 

operating leases  — the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under noncancelable real and personal property leases as of december 31 2010 

 

cash portion of the settlement agreement  — the settlement agreement is described more fully in “settlement agreement and related costs” of note 16 “commitments and contingencies” 

 

other principal contractual obligations  — other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy in the normal course of business these obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase 

 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

 

at december 31 2010 we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of 11 million which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities see note 15 “income taxes” for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we have reviewed our offbalance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

 

income tax payments 

 

we currently expect to pay between 100 million and 115 million in income taxes in 2011 assuming we do not make the settlement agreement payment in 2011 if we were to make the settlement agreement payment in 2011 we would cease making quarterly estimated us federal tax payments thus significantly reducing our cash payments 

 

contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of our us employees and for some of our nonus employees we currently expect employer contributions to be approximately 15 million in 2011 

 

environmental matters 

 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated statements of operations balance sheets or cash flows we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

 

principal sources of liquidity 

 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses capital expenditures interest taxes and dividend payments and to pay our debt obligations and other longterm liabilities as they come due our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations accumulated cash and amounts available under our existing lines of credit described below including the global credit facility and the european credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program 

 

we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above and the cash payment under the settlement agreement should it become payable within the next 12 months 

 

cash and cash equivalents 

 

the following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents 

 

 

see “analysis of historical cash flows” below 

 

lines of credit 

 

at december 31 2010 there were no amounts outstanding under our global and european credit facilities and we had 669 million available to us under these facilities we did not borrow funds from these facilities during any period in 2010 

 

further information about our lines of credit our outstanding longterm debt and the related financial covenants and limitations is provided in note 11 “debt and credit facilities” 

 

accounts receivable securitization program 

 

at december 31 2010 we had 91 million available to us under the program and we did not utilize this program in 2010 

 

see note 6 “accounts receivable securitization program” for information concerning this program 

 

covenants 

 

at december 31 2010 we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations as discussed in “covenants” of note 11 “debt and credit facilities” 

 

debt ratings 

 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically the company and our longterm senior unsecured debt are currently rated bb positive outlook by standard  poor’s on november 18 2010 standard  poor’s revised our ratings outlook to positive from stable this rating is considered noninvestment grade the company and our longterm senior unsecured debt are currently rated baa3 by moody’s this rating is considered investment grade on may 4 2010 moody’s revised our ratings outlook to stable from negative if our credit ratings are downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

 

outstanding indebtedness 

 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table see note 11 “debt and credit facilities” for further information on our debt 

 

 

 

analysis of historical cash flow 

 

changes in our consolidated cash flows in the three years ended december 31 2010 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities of 483 million for 2010 was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for noncash items of 480 million which included depreciation and amortization of 155 million sharebased compensation of 31 million and the loss on debt redemption of 39 million changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash source of 3 million 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities of 552 million for 2009 was primarily attributable to net income adjusted for noncash items of 440 million which included depreciation and amortization of 155 million and sharebased compensation of 39 million changes in operating assets and liabilities provided a net cash source of 112 million primarily due to 

 

  

partially offset by 

 

  

net cash used in investing activities 

 

 

in 2010 we used net cash of 97 million for investing activities which was primarily due to capital expenditures of 88 million and the use of 24 million of cash for the completion of three business acquisitions and one equity investment in 2010 these investments were not material individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial position or results of operations partially offsetting these uses of cash in 2010 were cash proceeds of 13 million received from the sale of all of our auction rate security investments in 2010 

 

 

in 2009 we used net cash of 70 million for investing activities which was primarily due to capital expenditures of 80 million during 2009 we completed the construction phase of gms with the launch of our manufacturing facility in poland 

 

we expect to continue to invest capital as we deem appropriate to expand our business to maintain or replace depreciating property plant and equipment to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity and sales growth we expect total capital expenditures in 2011 to be in the range of 150 million to 175 million this projection is based upon our capital expenditure budget for 2011 the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects anticipated future projects and historic spending trends this projection also supports targeted costreduction initiatives globally we expect to maintain this range of capital expenditures over the next several years to support our projected increases in unit volume growth using new technology platforms or otherwise requiring incremental capital 

net cash used in provided by financing activities 

 

 

in 2010 we used 373 million of cash and cash equivalents for financing activities primarily due to the following activities 

 

  

 

in 2009 our financing activities provided a net 90 million of cash and cash equivalents primarily due to the following activities 

 

  

partially offset by 

 

  

repurchases of capital stock 

 

during 2010 we repurchased 04 million shares of our common stock par value 010 per share in open market purchases at a cost of 10 million the average price per share of these common stock repurchases was 2291 during 2009 we did not repurchase any shares of common stock during 2008 we repurchased 4 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases at a cost of 95 million the average price per share of these common stock repurchases in 2008 was 2364 

 

we made the share repurchases in 2010 and 2008 under the share repurchase program adopted by our board of directors in august 2007 under which the board of directors authorized us to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of its issued and outstanding common stock the program has no set expiration date and we may from time to time continue to repurchase our common stock see item 5 “issuer purchases of equity securities” for further information on the share repurchase program 

 

changes in working capital 

 

 

the 7 decrease in working capital in the year ended december 31 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the following factors 

 

  

  

  

partially offset by 

 

  

changes in stockholders’ equity 

 

the 201 million or 9 increase in stockholders’ equity in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to the following

foreign currency forward contracts 

 

at december 31 2010 we were party to foreign currency forward contracts which did not have a significant impact on our liquidity

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and 

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

 

our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of accounts receivable as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards” 

 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts which is included in marketing administrative and development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations these changes may reflect changes in economic business and market conditions the allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of chargeoffs net of recoveries 

 

the provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including but not limited to a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with our customers in circumstances where a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations is known we record a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount we reasonably assess will be collected if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to pay our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount 

 

fair value measurements 

 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 

 

 49 

 

  

our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for further details on our fair value measurements 

 

commitments and contingencies — litigation 

 

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability and we expect to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

the determination of the value of longlived assets requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we periodically review longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 

 

assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses such as future cash flows which are based on operational performance market conditions and other factors and disposition costs may affect the carrying value of longlived assets and result in possible impairment expense in our consolidated financial statements as assumptions and estimates change in the future we may be required to record an impairment charge 

 

goodwill 

 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment — the “component” level — discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

 

we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment we must recognize a noncash impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value 

fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units assumptions for sales net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

 

income approach used to determine fair values 

 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis we use a discount rate that reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value longterm growth rates provisions for income taxes future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless debtfree working capital 

 

market approaches used to determine fair values 

 

each year we consider various market approaches that could be used to determine fair value historically we have considered two relevant market approaches in 2010 an additional relevant market approach was included to determine fair value and this approach is referred to as the merger and acquisition method 

 

the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance these multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the company the third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publiclytraded and privatelyheld companies in the packaging industry 

 

the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include trailing and future 12month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied under the first and second market approaches a control premium or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

 

see note 9 “goodwill and identifiable intangible assets” for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2010 and other related information 

 

pensions 

 

we maintain a qualified noncontributory profit sharing plan and qualified contributory retirement savings plans in which most us employees are eligible to participate for a limited number of our us employees and for some of our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these 

assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 

 

at december 31 2010 the projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans was 55 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2010 was 3 million at december 31 2010 the projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 286 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2010 was 16 million 

 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2010 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2011 in millions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

income taxes 

 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 15 “income taxes” for further discussion

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in the conditions in the global financial markets interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices and the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers which may adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

 

interest rates 

 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

 

at december 31 2010 we had outstanding interest rate swaps but no outstanding collars or options 

the information set forth in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” under the caption “interest rate swaps” is incorporated herein by reference 

 

see note 13 “fair value measurements and other financial instruments” for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of 57 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2010 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount or any related interest of such debt 

 

foreign exchange rates 

 

operations 

 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations in the future see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above for the impacts foreign currency translation had on our operations 

 

venezuela 

 

economic events in venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk 

 

effective january 1 2010 venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy under us gaap and the us dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency for our subsidiary in venezuela accordingly all bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured into us dollars using the current exchange rate available to us and any changes in the exchange rate were reflected in foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to our venezuelan subsidiary on the consolidated statement of operations also in january 2010 the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate from 215 bolivars per us dollar to 43 bolivars per us dollar for nonessential transactions and 260 bolivars per us dollar for essential transactions 

 

on january 1 2010 we did not have access or permission to use the official exchange rate accordingly for the majority of our transactions we accessed the parallel foreign currency exchange market which was a rate of 595 bolivars per us dollar at december 31 2009 that was available to entities that did not have access to the official exchange rate since we did not have access to the official exchange rate we translated our venezuelan subsidiary’s balance sheet using the parallel rate at december 31 2009 

 

in may 2010 the venezuelan government closed the parallel foreign currency exchange market and in june 2010 replaced it with a new foreign currency exchange system the transaction system in securities in foreign currency “sitme” the central bank of venezuela began accepting and approving applications under certain conditions for non government operated foreign exchange administrative board “cadivi” exchange transactions at the weightedaverage implicit exchange rate obtained from the sitme effective june 9 2010 the sitme weighted average implicit exchange rate was 53 bolivars per us dollar we did not access the sitme during 2010 

 

from time to time during 2010 our access to the official exchange rate was restricted however as of december 31 2010 we had access to the cadivi in venezuela therefore as of december 31 2010 we remeasured the net bolivardenominated monetary assets of approximately 16 million consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents of our venezuelan subsidiary using the official exchange rate of 43 bolivars per us dollar at december 31 2010 our venezuelan subsidiary had a negative cumulative translation adjustment balance of approximately 46 million during 2010 we settled transactions at the applicable official exchange rates 

 

as a result of the changes in the exchange rates upon settlement of bolivardenominated transactions and upon the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements we recognized net gains of 6 million for the year ended december 31 2010 

for the year ended december 31 2010 less than 1 of our consolidated net sales were derived from our business in venezuela and approximately 2 of our consolidated operating profit was derived from our business in venezuela 

 

effective january 1 2011 the venezuelan government devalued the bolivar by eliminating the nonessential exchange rate of 260 bolivars per us dollar therefore there are now only two legal exchange rates available this includes the cadivi nonessential rate of 43 bolivars per us dollar and the sitme rate of 53 bolivars per us dollar 

 

the potential future impact to our consolidated financial position and results of operations for future bolivardenominated transactions will depend on our access to us dollars and on the exchange rates in effect when we enter into remeasure and settle transactions therefore it is difficult to predict the future impact until each transaction settles at its applicable exchange rate or gets remeasured into us dollars 

 

foreign currency forward contracts 

 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amounts payable or receivable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2010 would have caused us to pay approximately 24 million to terminate these contracts 

 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 12 “derivatives and hedging activities” which is contained in part ii item 8 and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — derivative financial instruments — foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference 

 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to certain financing transactions these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2010 we had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 

 

outstanding debt 

 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrower we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 26 million at december 31 2010 and 109 million at december 31 2009 

 

customer credit 

 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons our provision for bad debt expense was 7 million in 2010 6 million in 2009 and 9 million in 2008 the allowance for doubtful accounts was 17 million at december 31 2010 and 18 million at december 31 2009 

 

pensions 

 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit 

pension plans at december 31 2010 we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately 14 million in 2011 see note 14 “profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans” for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

 

commodities 

 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

foreign operations 

we operate through our subsidiaries in the united states and in the 50 other countries listed below and our products are distributed in these countries as well as in other parts of the world 



in maintaining our foreign operations we face risks inherent in these operations such as currency fluctuations information on currency exchange risk appears in part ii item 7a of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference other risks attendant to our foreign operations are set forth in part i item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference financial information showing net sales and total longlived assets by geographic region for each of the three years ended december 31 2009 appears in note 3 segments of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which information is incorporated herein by reference we maintain programs to comply with the various laws rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countries in which we operate see environmental matters below 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 16200 employees worldwide approximately 6800 of these employees were in the us with approximately 100 of these employees covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 9400 employees who were outside the us approximately 6200 were covered by collective bargaining agreements outside of the us many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 

marketing distribution and customers 

at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 2600 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors fabricators converters ecommerce and mail order fulfillment firms and contract packaging firms as well as directly to endusers such as food processors food service businesses supermarket retailers pharmaceutical companies medical device manufacturers and other manufacturers

we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2009 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

seasonality 

we do not consider seasonality to be material to our consolidated net sales or to any reportable business segment net sales historically net sales in our food businesses have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events our protective packaging segment has tended to also be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during the backtoschool season in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season 

competition 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership we invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year there are also other companies producing competing products that are well established 

there are other manufacturers of food packaging and food solutions products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic metals and other materials we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the united states 

our protective packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts and wood blocking and bracing systems we believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products 

competition in specialty materials is focused on performance characteristics and price competition for most of our medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price technical design capability is an additional competitive factor for the rigid packaging offered by the medical applications business 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in each of our reportable business segments are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films and paper and wood pulp products we also purchase corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap® brand cushioning inks for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from other suppliers 

the raw materials for our products generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several suppliers however we have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our business natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers we source some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs 

sourcing 

we have a centralized supply chain organization which includes centralized management of procurement and logistics our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve sourcing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions we do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent sourcing practices 

research and development activities 

we maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and to improve our existing products and processes including developing new packaging and nonpackaging applications for our products from time to time we also acquire and commercialize new packaging and other products or techniques developed by others our research and development projects rely on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science package design and equipment engineering we spent 812 million in 2009 856 million in 2008 and 908 million in 2007 on research and development 

patents and trademarks 

we are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over 3000 united states and foreign patents and patent applications as well as an aggregate of over 3000 united states and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products manufacturing processes and equipment we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage as such each year we continue to file in the aggregate an average of 200 united states and foreign patent applications and 250 united states and foreign trademark applications none of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts we believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial position 

environmental health and safety matters 

as a manufacturer we are subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which we operate covering the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals and the release of materials into the environment regarding standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment we review environmental health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial position 

in some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things recycled or reprocessed content and sale or disposal of packaging materials in addition customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that incorporate renewable materials or that are otherwise viewed as being environmentally sound our new ventures activities described above emphasize the development of packaging products from renewable resources we maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations to monitor their evolution and to meet this customer demand one advantage inherent in many of our products is that thin lightweight packaging solutions reduce waste and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives we continue to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they become available 

we also support our customers interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of our products or product packaging and for materials used in some of our products 

when possible materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in our protective packaging operations or offered to other manufacturers for use in other products in addition gains that we have made in internal recycling programs have allowed us to improve our net raw material yield thus mitigating the impact of resin costs while lowering solid waste disposal costs and controlling waste disposal environmental liability risks 

our emphasis on environmental health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees for which we are recognized as leaders in our industry our website wwwsealedaircomcitizenship  contains additional detailed information about our corporate citizenship initiatives

 item 1a risk factors 

introduction 

investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision these are the most significant risk factors however they are not the only risk factors that you should consider in making an investment decision 

this annual report on form 10k also contains and may incorporate by reference from our proxy statement for our 2010 annual meeting of stockholders or from exhibits forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties see the cautionary notice regarding forwardlooking statements below our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including the risks that we face which are described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in documents incorporated by reference in this report 

our business consolidated financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks the trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment 

weakened global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

weakened global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business in the form of lower net sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix or in lower profit margins 

during periods of economic recession there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices if we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated revenue profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers this could result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the global nature of our operations in the united states and in 50 foreign countries exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we operate in the united states and in 50 other countries and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world a large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the united states operations outside of the united states particularly operations in developing regions are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our us operations 

economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate including developing regions could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas 

risks inherent in our international operations include social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions exchange controls foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations including devaluations the potential for changes in local economic conditions including local inflationary pressures restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters including antidumping duties tariffs embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures changes in laws and regulations including the laws and policies of the united states affecting trade and foreign investment the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities and unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against united states or other interests in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies in repatriating funds from our nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

if the settlement of the asbestosrelated claims that we have agreed to the settlement agreement is not implemented we will not be released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us arising from a 1998 transaction with w r grace  co we are also a defendant in a number of asbestosrelated actions in canada arising from w r grace  cos activities in canada prior to the 1998 transaction 

on november 27 2002 we reached an agreement in principle with the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants the acc and the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the w r grace  co grace bankruptcy case to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims made against us and our affiliates the settlement agreement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims and successor liability claims as well as indemnification claims by fresenius medical care holdings inc and affiliated companies in connection with the cryovac transaction the cryovac transaction was a multistep transaction completed on march 31 1998 which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air corporations business under the common ownership of the company the parties to the agreement in principle signed the definitive settlement agreement as of november 10 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle on june 27 2005 the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware where the grace bankruptcy case is pending signed an order approving the definitive settlement agreement although grace is not a party to the settlement agreement under the terms of the order grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions on september 19 2008 grace the acc the asbestos pi future claimants representative the fcr and the official committee of equity security holders the equity committee filed as coproponents a plan of reorganization as filed and amended from time to time the pi settlement plan and several exhibits and associated documents including a disclosure statement as filed and amended from time to time the pi settlement disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court as filed the pi settlement plan would provide for the establishment of two asbestos trusts under section 524g of the united states bankruptcy code to which present and future asbestosrelated claims would be channeled the pi settlement plan also contemplates that the terms of our definitive settlement agreement will be incorporated into the pi settlement plan and that we will pay the amount contemplated by that agreement 

if confirmed the pi settlement plan may implement the terms of the settlement agreement but there can be no assurance that this will be the case the terms of the pi settlement plan remain subject to amendment moreover the pi settlement plan is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions including the availability of exit financing and the approval of both the bankruptcy court and united states district court for the district of delaware the district court a number of objections to the pi settlement plan have been filed and remain unresolved and certain of these objections concern injunctions releases and provisions as applied to us andor that are contemplated by the settlement agreement 

the bankruptcy court has conducted hearings to consider confirmation of the pi settlement plan and has heard closing arguments with respect to the pi settlement plan but additional hearings may be held by 

the bankruptcy court and the district court to consider matters related to the pi settlement plan we do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization will become effective assuming that a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court approved by the district court and does become effective we do not know whether the final plan of reorganization will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement and if the other conditions to our obligation to pay the settlement agreement amount will be met if these conditions are not satisfied or not waived by us we will not be obligated to pay the amount contemplated by the settlement agreement however if we do not pay the settlement agreement amount we and our affiliates will not be released from the various claims against us 

if the settlement agreement does not become effective either because grace fails to emerge from bankruptcy or because grace does not emerge from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement then we and our affiliates will not be released from the various asbestosrelated fraudulent transfer successor liability and indemnification claims made against us and our affiliates noted above and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to be resolved through other means such as through agreement on alternative settlement terms or trials in that case we could face liabilities that are significantly different from our obligations under the settlement agreement we cannot estimate at this time what those differences or their magnitude may be in the event these liabilities are materially larger than the current existing obligations they could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

since november 2004 the company and specified subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of cases including a number of putative class actions brought in canada as a result of graces alleged marketing manufacturing or distributing of asbestos or asbestoscontaining products in canada prior to the cryovac transaction in 1998 grace has agreed to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases the canadian cases are currently stayed a global settlement of these canadian claims to be funded by grace has been approved by the canadian court and the pi settlement plan provides for payment of these claims we do not have any positive obligations under the canadian settlement but we are a beneficiary of the release of claims the release in favor of the grace parties including us will become operative upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization in graces united states chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding as filed the pi settlement plan contemplates that the claims released under the canadian settlement will be subject to injunctions under section 524g of the bankruptcy code by its terms the canadian settlement will unless amended become null and void if a confirmation order in the grace us bankruptcy proceeding is not granted prior to december 31 2010 we can give no assurance that the pi settlement plan or any other plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the bankruptcy court approved by the district court or will become effective assuming that a final plan of reorganization whether the pi settlement plan or another plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court approved by the district court and does become effective if the final plan of reorganization does not incorporate the terms of the canadian settlement or if the canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the canadian courts and if in addition grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify us and our subsidiaries in these cases then we could be required to pay substantial damages which we cannot estimate at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

a downgrade of our credit ratings could have a negative impact on our costs and ability to access credit markets 

our longterm senior unsecured debt is currently rated bb stable outlook by standard  poors financial services llc this rating is considered below investment grade our longterm senior unsecured debt is currently rated baa3 negative outlook by moodys investor service inc this rating is considered investment grade if our credit ratings are further downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs could increase 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energyrelated costs may negatively impact our results of operations including our profit margins 

we use petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of our products increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemicalbased raw materials and energy could increase our costs we also have some solesource suppliers and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers and which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as mad cow disease footandmouth disease and avian influenza or birdflu as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues 

we manufacture and sell food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products in recent years occasional cases of mad cow disease have been confirmed and incidents of bird flu have surfaced in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases such as mad cow or footandmouth disease for example may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for our products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

concerns about greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change and the resulting governmental and market responses to these issues could increase costs that we incur and could otherwise affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been enacted and proposed in response to concerns about ghg emissions and climate change we are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products including plastic packaging materials increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw materials and freight and energy costs we could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits 

disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect our external liquidity sources 

our principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under our existing lines of credit including our global credit facility our european credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program as described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which is included in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k our accounts receivable securitization program includes a bank financing commitment that must be renewed annually prior to the expiration date the bank commitment is scheduled to expire on december 3 2010 while the bank is not obligated to renew the bank financing commitment we have negotiated annual renewals since the commencement of the program in 2001 

additionally recent conditions in financial markets including the bankruptcy and restructuring of some financial institutions could affect financial institutions with which we have relationships and could result in adverse effects on our ability to utilize fully our committed borrowing facilities for example a lender under our global credit facility or the european credit facility may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and we may not be able to replace such lender 

covenant restrictions under our credit arrangements may pose a risk 

we have a number of credit facilities including our global credit facility and our european credit facility and also have an accounts receivable securitization program as well as debt securities we have issued to manage liquidity and fund operations as described in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which is included in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k the agreements relating to these facilities and securities generally contain certain restrictive covenants including the incurrence of additional indebtedness restriction of liens and sale and leaseback transactions financial covenants relating to interest coverage debt leverage and minimum liquidity and restrictions on consolidation and merger transactions as well as in some cases restrictions on amendments to the settlement agreement in addition amounts available under our accounts receivable securitization program can be impacted by a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience as a result of the impact of some of these factors the amount available to us under the program has decreased although we do not believe that any of these covenants or other restrictive provisions presently materially restricts our liquidity position a breach of one or more of the covenants or an event that triggers other restrictive provisions could result in material adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business consolidated results of operations and financial position this in turn could result in a further decline in amounts available under the accounts receivable securitization program or termination of the program such adverse consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering the obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders or the bank commitment related to our accounts receivable securitization program refusal by lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings 

strengthening of the us dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

during 2009 approximately 54 of our sales originated outside the united states we translate sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for our consolidated financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar our reported international sales and net earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer us dollars 

also while we often produce in the same geographic markets as our products are sold expenses are relatively concentrated in the united states compared with sales so that in a time of strengthening of the us dollar our profit margins could be reduced while we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate us completely from currency effects 

we may have to recognize foreign exchange gains andor losses related to the recent currency devaluation in venezuela and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america or us gaap effective january 1 2010 see foreign currency exchange rate risk of item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion 

we may use financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which use exposes us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 derivatives and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the full realization of our deferred tax assets including primarily those related to the settlement agreement and the other than temporary impairment of our investments in auction rate securities may be affected by a number of factors 

we have deferred tax assets related to the settlement agreement the other than temporary impairment of our investments in auction rate securities other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances employee benefit items and other items we have established valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends in part upon our future operating results we expect to realize these assets over an extended period consequently changes in tax laws could cause actual results to differ from projections 

our largest deferred tax asset relates to our settlement agreement including accrued interest the value of this asset may be affected by our tax situation at the time of the payment under the settlement agreement as well as by the value of our common stock at that time the deferred tax asset reflects the fair market value of 18 million shares of our common stock at a postsplit price of 1786 per share based on the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 

our annual effective tax rate can materially change as a result of changes in our us and foreign mix of earnings and other factors including changes in tax laws and changes by regulatory authorities 

our overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis changes in statutory tax rates and laws as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us for example recent legislative proposals to change us taxation of nonus earnings or a failure to extend the us research and experimentation credit could increase our effective tax rate also changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on our overall effective tax rate 

we experience competition in our operating segments and in the geographic areas in which we operate 

our products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products we compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are strong well established companies our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volume which would have a negative impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

a slowing pipeline of new technologies and solutions at favorable margins could adversely affect our performance and prospects for future growth 

our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales expectations or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

a major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business 

if we experienced a natural disaster such as a tornado hurricane earthquake or other severe weather event or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

the price of our common stock has on occasion experienced significant price and volume fluctuations the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock one stockholder has beneficial ownership of approximately 37 of our common shares 

the market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations greater than those experienced by the broader stock market in addition our announcements of our quarterly operating results future developments relating to the w r grace  co bankruptcy additional litigation against us the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues spikes in raw material and energy related costs changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us our customers suppliers and competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 

the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the price of the common stock according to a schedule 13ga filed with the sec on february 12 2010 davis selected advisers lp reported beneficial ownership of 58959652 shares or approximately 37 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as such davis selected advisers has a significant voting block with respect to matters submitted to a stockholder vote including the election of directors and the approval of potential business combination transactions 

while the schedule 13ga filed by davis selected advisers lp indicates that the beneficially owned shares of our common stock were not acquired for the purpose of changing or influencing the control of the company if that stockholder were to change its purpose for holding our common stock from investment to attempting to change or influence our management this concentration of our common stock could potentially affect the company and the price of our common stock 

weakness in the financial and credit markets and other factors could potentially lead to the impairment of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other longlived assets and our investments in auction rate securities 

we have seven reporting units that are included in our segment reporting structure the six reporting units with goodwill balances allocated to them are food packaging food solutions protective packaging shrink packaging specialty materials and medical applications 

we test goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually during the fourth quarter of each year and at other times if events or changes in circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable prior to our 2009 annual testing we tested the goodwill of some of our reporting units at certain times earlier in the year but no impairment charges were recorded 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we completed step one of our annual impairment test and fair value analysis for goodwill and there were no impairments present and no impairment charge was recorded we had the estimated fair values updated for all of our reporting units except for the new ventures reporting unit because this reporting unit does not have any goodwill included in its net asset value 

although we determined that there was no goodwill impairment in 2009 the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment such as a decrease in our expected net earnings adverse equity market conditions a decline in current market multiples a decline in our common stock price a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of could require an interim assessment for some or all of the reporting units before the next required annual assessment in the event of significant adverse changes of the nature described above we might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we recorded a total of 380 million of pretax charges in 2009 and 2008 as a result of recognizing impairment related to other than temporary declines in the estimated fair market value of our auction rate securities investments this impairment was due to the continuing decline in the creditworthiness of the issuers of these securities and the lack of a market for auction rate securities generally the original cost of our auction rate securities investments was 447 million and the estimated remaining fair market value was 137 million at december 31 2009 and 107 million at december 31 2008 we continue to monitor developments in the market for auction rate securities including the specific securities in which we have invested if liquidity conditions relating to these securities or the issuers worsen we may recognize additional other than temporary impairments which would result in the recognition of additional losses on our consolidated statement of operations 

product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation or the value of our brands 

claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business in addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions we could also be required to recall possibly defective products which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses 

although we maintain product liability insurance coverage potential product liability claims could be excluded or exceed coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage 

our subsidiaries hold substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations and as a result we rely on distributions or advances from our subsidiaries 

we conduct substantially all of our business through two direct whollyowned subsidiaries cryovac inc and sealed air corporation us these two subsidiaries directly and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of our business and conduct operations themselves and through other subsidiaries around the globe therefore we depend on distributions or advances from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends with respect to shares of our common stock contractual provisions laws or regulations to which we or any of our subsidiaries may become subject tax inefficiencies and the financial condition and operating requirements of subsidiaries may reduce funds available for service of our indebtedness dividends and general corporate purposes

other property information 

we own the large majority of our manufacturing facilities some of these facilities are subject to secured or other financing arrangements we lease the balance of our manufacturing facilities which are generally smaller sites our manufacturing facilities are usually located in general purpose buildings that house our specialized machinery for the manufacture of one or more products because of the relatively low density of our air cellular polyethylene foam and protective mailer products we realize significant freight savings by locating our manufacturing facilities for these products near our customers and distributors 

we also occupy facilities containing sales distribution technical warehouse or administrative functions at a number of locations in the united states and in many foreign countries some of these facilities are located on the manufacturing sites that we own and some on those that we lease standalone facilities of these types are generally leased our global headquarters are located in a leased property in elmwood park new jersey for a list of those countries outside of the united states where we have operations see foreign operations above our website wwwsealedaircom contains additional information about our worldwide business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

the information set forth in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k in note 16 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements under the captions cryovac transaction commitments and contingencies mpers lawsuit and other litigation and claims is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2009 we were a party to or otherwise involved in several federal state and foreign environmental proceedings and private environmental claims for the cleanup of superfund sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 and other sites we may have potential liability for investigation and cleanup of some of these sites it is our policy to accrue for environmental cleanup costs if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and if we can reasonably estimate an amount or range of costs associated with various alternative remediation strategies without giving effect to any possible future insurance proceeds as assessments and cleanups proceed we review these liabilities periodically and adjust our reserves as additional information becomes available at december 31 2009 environmental related reserves were not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations while it is often difficult to estimate potential liabilities and the future impact of environmental matters based upon the information currently available to us and our experience in dealing with these matters we believe that our potential future liability with respect to these sites is not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

we are also involved in various other legal actions incidental to our business we believe after consulting with counsel that the disposition of these other legal proceedings and matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we present financial information in accordance with us gaap but we also present financial measures that do not conform to us gaap or nonus gaap as discussed below we provide this supplemental information as our management believes it is useful to investors investors should use caution however when reviewing our nonus gaap presentations the nonus gaap information is not a substitute for us gaap information it does not purport to represent the similarly titled us gaap information should not be considered as a substitute for the us gaap information and is not an indicator of our performance under us gaap further nonus gaap financial measures that we present may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by others 

in our 2010 outlook below we present anticipated full year 2010 diluted net earning per common share on a us gaap basis but also on a nonus gaap adjusted basis—excluding an estimated 002 charge related to gms we believe that excluding the anticipated gms charge from our projected earnings aids in the comparison of our earnings performance between 2010 and prior years our management will look at our earnings performance both including the gms charge and excluding it further we may use adjusted earnings per share results to determine incentive compensation thus our management believes that this information may be useful to investors 

in our highlights of financial performance and in our net sales by segment reporting structure below we first present our results in accordance with us gaap but in the discussions that follow we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information changes in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation is a nonus gaap financial measure which we define as constant dollar similarly in changes in working capital below we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation on changes in inventories as a worldwide business it is important that we take into account the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies nonetheless we cannot directly control changes in foreign currency exchange rates consequently when management looks at our net sales to measure the performance of our business it typically excludes the impact of foreign currency translation we also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations as a result management believes that these presentations may be useful to investors 

overview 

beginning with the invention of bubble wrap® fifty years ago we have become a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and performancebased materials and equipment systems that now serve an array of food industrial medical and consumer applications 

at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 2600 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products through a large number of distributors fabricators and converters as well as directly to endusers such as food processors food service businesses supermarket retailers and manufacturers we have no material longterm contracts for the distribution of our products in 2009 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales 

we do not consider seasonality to be material to our consolidated net sales or to any reportable business segment net sales historically net sales in our food businesses have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter due to holiday events our protective packaging segment has tended to also be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher during the backtoschool season in the midthird quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season 

competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and as a result we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership for more details on our competition see competition included in business of item 1 of part i 

our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation our costs can vary with changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs which are not within our control consequently our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemicalbased raw materials as efficiently as possible we also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions 

our businesses are managed to generate substantial operating cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to modify our capital structure as the need or opportunity arises 

2010 outlook 

although a fair amount of uncertainty remains about the pace and timing of economic recovery we are anticipating a modest recovery in global economic conditions in 2010 we are assuming that the pace and timing of the recovery will be led by developing regions with more advanced economies experiencing a slower more modest rate of recovery as a result we are anticipating a 4 to 6 growth in our net sales from a combination of unit volume growth and product pricemix 

we also are assuming that we may experience increased raw material costs for north american commodity resins and we expect to take pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases we anticipate marketing administrative and development expenses to be in the range of 16 to 17 of net sales and a full year 2010 effective tax rate of 27 

as a result we anticipate full year 2010 diluted net earnings per common share to be in the range of 148 to 168 or 150 to 170 on an adjusted basis to exclude an estimated 002 charge related to the remaining portion of our global manufacturing strategy or gms 

significant 2009 events 

gms 

in 2009 we completed the construction phase of gms with the launch of our manufacturing facility in duchnice poland this facility along with our other new facilities in qingpu china and monterrey mexico substantially finishes the construction and launch of all three greenfield sites related to this program 

in november 2009 we committed to relocating our bagmaking and printing operations presently in norderstedt germany by june 30 2010 to other existing facilities in europe we estimate that we will incur total costs of approximately 7 million including 5 million recorded in 2009 in connection with this project which would be future cash expenditures primarily for costs for one time termination benefits see global manufacturing strategy and 2008 cost reduction and productivity program below for additional details of gms 

financing activities 

in 2009 we completed the following financing activities 

• retirement of the remaining outstanding balance of 1367 million of our 695 senior notes • redemption of the entire 4313 million of our 3 convertible senior notes due 2033 in july 2009 • issuance of 300 million of 12 senior notes due february 2014 • issuance of 400 million of 7875 senior notes due june 2017 25 

• execution of a 150 million euro senior unsecured revolving credit facility due july 2012 known as our european credit facility and • cancellation of our 170 million australian dollar revolving credit facility that was due to expire in march 2010 further information on these financing activities and on our total debt and available credit is included in note 11 debt and credit facilities of notes to consolidated financial statements also see principal sources of liquidity below for a discussion of our current liquidity position 

quarterly cash dividends 

on february 18 2010 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 012 per common share which is payable on march 19 2010 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 5 2010 the estimated amount of this dividend payment is 19 million based on 159 million shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of january 31 2010 

during 2009 and 2008 we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of 012 per common share in each quarter using a total of 152 million from available cash 

highlights of financial performance 

highlights of our financial performance for 2009 compared with 2008 and 2007 were 



 denotes a change equal to or greater than 100 

our net earnings increased 36 in 2009 compared with 2008 despite a 12 decline in net sales the primary contributing factors to our net earnings growth were lower input costs and restructuring charges the incremental benefits generated from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and other cost reduction initiatives and incremental benefits from gms during the year we experienced lower unit volume results and relatively flat product pricemix 

our consolidated unit volume results for 2009 detailed below were lower than comparable periods primarily reflecting weak global economic conditions our protective packaging segment and our specialty materials business which combined represent approximately 32 of our consolidated net sales in the period were the most impacted by the recession these lower unit volumes were judged by management to be 

consistent with our peers in each segment and with economic indicators of customer demand in each segment and geographic region we continue to believe that the unit volume declines experienced in these businesses do not represent a shift in our competitiveness or in the quality of our products and solutions 

comparing the fourth quarter of 2009 with the third quarter of 2009 or sequentially the protective packaging segment and specialty materials business experienced a combined 6 reported increase in net sales to 366 million from 346 million excluding a 2 favorable impact of foreign currency translation these businesses recorded a 4 increase in net sales this increase reflected a combination of a seasonal lift from the holiday shopping season modest customer inventory restocking and to a lesser extent new product placements sequentially our food packaging and food solutions segments experienced a combined 7 reported increase in net sales to 740 million from 693 million excluding a 3 favorable impact of foreign currency translation these segments recorded a 4 increase in net sales which primarily reflected a seasonal lift in demand due to the holiday period 

see the discussion below for further details about the material factors that contributed to the changes in net sales by our segment reporting structure and by geographic region and operating profit 

net sales by segment reporting structure 

the following table presents net sales by our segment reporting structure 



foreign currency translation impact on net sales 

for the first nine months of 2009 the us dollar remained strong relative to most foreign currencies this resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of 242 million in 2009 compared with 2008 this impact includes a favorable foreign currency translation impact of 49 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 as most foreign currencies began to strengthen against the us dollar due in part to concerns about the ability of some countries in the eurozone to effectively manage sovereign debt obligations and rising budget deficits the euro has weakened against the us dollar during the first quarter of 2010 

in 2008 we experienced a strengthening of most foreign currencies against the us dollar which resulted in a favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales of 110 million in 2008 compared with 2007 this impact includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 66 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the strengthening of the us dollar against most foreign currencies which continued through the first nine months of 2009 

the following tables present the components of change in net sales for the year ended 2009 compared with 2008 and the year ended 2008 compared with 2007 we also present the change in net sales excluding 

the impact of foreign currency translation a nonus gaap measure which we define as constant dollar we believe using constant dollar comparisons aids in the comparability with other periods 



  



the following net sales discussion is on a constant dollar basis 

food packaging segment net sales 

2009 compared with 2008 

the 9 million or 1 decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to 

• decreases in unit volume in europe of 24 million or 5 and in the united states of 19 million or 2 partially offset by 

• favorable impacts of product pricemix in latin america of 31 million or 11 the decrease in unit volume in europe was primarily due to lower equipment sales which was mostly the result of lower capital spending by customers in this region the decrease in unit volume in the united states was primarily due to the decline in local meat production mostly experienced during the first nine months of 2009 the unit volume declines in europe and the united states reflected the continuing economic weakness in these regions the favorable impact of product pricemix in latin america was primarily due to the timing of pricing actions on most food packaging products in part to cover the weakness of the venezuelan currency 

2008 compared with 2007 

the 51 million or 3 increase in net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to 

• favorable impacts of product pricemix in latin america of 23 million or 8 and in the united states of 36 million or 4 and • increases in unit volume in the united states of 10 million or 1 and in europe of 9 million or 2 28 

partially offset by 

• a decrease in unit volume in latin america of 23 million or 8 the favorable impacts of product pricemix in latin america and the united states were primarily due to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in december 2007 and during 2008 for most food packaging products 

the increase in unit volume in the united states was primarily attributed to higher pork slaughter rates during the first half of 2008 which in turn resulted in higher sales of our fresh meat packaging products the increase in unit volume in europe was primarily attributed to net positive trends in this region during the first half of 2008 in the fresh red meat and cheese markets which in turn resulted in higher sales of our fresh meat and dairy packaging products 

the decrease in unit volume in latin america was primarily due to market factors in brazil throughout 2008 brazilian meat exports to europe were restricted due to some brazilian meat processors lack of compliance with previously issued european food traceability and safety standards by late 2008 the majority of brazilian meat processors had complied with the standards but by this time endmarket demand in europe had slowed due to a decline in meat consumption attributable to weak economic conditions 

food solutions segment net sales 

2009 compared with 2008 

the 39 million or 4 decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to decreases in unit volume in europe of 29 million or 7 and in the united states of 13 million or 3 the decrease in unit volume in europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of reduced consumption of certain meats in some countries which in turn resulted in lower sales of our caseready packaging products the decrease in the united states was primarily due to lower sales of our vertical pouch packaging products to customers in the food service sector both declines in europe and the united states reflected the economic weakness in these regions 

2008 compared with 2007 

the 18 million or 2 increase in net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to 

• favorable impacts of product pricemix in the united states of 22 million or 6 and in europe of 8 million or 2 and • an increase in unit volume in the asiapacific region of 9 million or 7 partially offset by 

• decreases in unit volume in europe of 14 million or 4 and in the united states of 11 million or 3 the favorable impacts of product pricemix in both the united states and europe were primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in december 2007 and in 2008 for most food solutions products 

the increase in unit volume in the asiapacific region was primarily attributed to product adoption by new and existing customers of our caseready products 

the decrease in unit volume in europe was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of lower consumption of meats and cheeses in certain countries resulting from deteriorating economic conditions in this region and to a lesser extent certain low margin business we decided to withdraw from in the first quarter of 2008 the decrease in unit volume in the united states was primarily due to a large retailer opting in november 2007 to move from a caseready packaging format to an alternative packaging format for a portion of its meat packaging this decrease was partially offset by increased flexible food film and vertical pouch packaging products sales to existing customers in this region 

outsourced products 

in addition to net sales from products produced in our facilities approximately 16 in 2009 17 in 2008 and 19 in 2007 of net trade sales in this segment were from the sale of products fabricated by other manufacturers which we refer to as outsourced products outsourced products include among others foam and solid plastic trays and containers fabricated primarily in north america and in europe which largely support our case ready products we have strategically opted to use thirdparty manufacturers for technically less complex products and selected equipment in order to offer customers a broader range of solutions we have benefited from this strategy with increased net sales and operating profit requiring minimal capital expenditures net sales of outsourced products included in this segment amounted to 147 million in 2009 170 million in 2008 and 181 million in 2007 additional sales of 90 million in 2009 70 million in 2008 and 83 million in 2007 from the sales of outsourced products were primarily in our protective packaging segment 

protective packaging segment net sales 

2009 compared with 2008 

the 238 million or 16 decrease in net sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit volume in the united states of 113 million or 14 and in europe of 70 million or 16 these declines were principally attributable to continuing economic weakness in these regions which were consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends 

2008 compared with 2007 

the 60 million or 4 decrease in net sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily the result of lower unit volume in the united states of 48 million or 6 and in europe of 19 million or 4 which was principally attributable to weakening regional economic conditions and was consistent with manufacturing output shipping and retail indicators 

partially offsetting this decrease in unit volume was the favorable impact of product pricemix in the united states of 14 million or 2 primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in december 2007 and during 2008 for most protective packaging products 

other net sales 

2009 compared with 2008 

the 73 million or 18 decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily attributed to lower unit volumes in north america of 44 million or 29 and in europe of 27 million or 14 these declines were primarily attributed to lower unit volumes for some of our specialty materials products which were principally the result of continuing economic weakness in these regions consistent with manufacturing output and export and shipping trends 

2008 compared with 2007 

other net sales increased 73 million or 23 in 2008 compared with 2007 excluding 62 million in net sales resulting from the november 2007 acquisition of certain assets relating to ethafoam® and related polyethylene foam product lines and the august 2007 acquisition of alga plastics other net sales would have increased 12 million or 4 primarily due to 

• a favorable impact of product pricemix in north america of 11 million or 10 primarily attributed to the positive impact of selling price increases for most of our specialty materials products and • an increase in unit volume in asia of 7 million or 18 primarily due to adoption of medical applications products by new and existing customers mainly in the first half of 2008 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in unit volume in the united states of 3 million or 3 primarily attributed to lower unit volume in some of our specialty materials products which was principally the result of weakening regional economic conditions and was consistent with manufacturing output indicators 

net sales by geographic region

2009 compared with 2008 



by geographic region the components of the increase in net sales for 2008 compared with 2007 were as follows 

2008 compared with 2007 



see net sales by segment reporting structure above for details of the major factors trends and regions that contributed to the changes in net sales in the periods mentioned above 

cost of sales 

our primary input costs include resins direct and indirect labor other raw materials and other energyrelated costs including transportation costs we utilize petrochemicalbased resins in the manufacture of many of our products the costs for these raw materials are impacted by the rise and fall in crude oil and natural gas prices since they serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of most resins the prices for these feedstocks have been particularly volatile in recent years although changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks they are indicative of the variations in raw materials and other input costs we face we continue to monitor changes in raw material and energyrelated costs as they occur and take pricing actions as appropriate to lessen the impact of cost increases when they occur 

the following table shows our cost of sales for the three years ended december 31 2009 



2009 compared with 2008 

the 583 million decrease in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to 

• favorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 200 million which was primarily experienced in the first nine months of 2009 • the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of 185 million • other lower input costs including favorable freight and energyrelated costs in 2009 of approximately 45 million and • estimated benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 including approximately 40 million of incremental benefits from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and from gms expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of gms were 10 million in 2009 compared with 7 million in 2008 

2008 compared with 2007 

the 257 million increase in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to 

• unfavorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 125 million which was experienced in the first nine months of 2008 • the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 73 million and • other higher input costs including unfavorable freight and energyrelated costs in 2008 of approximately 26 million also contributing to the increase in cost of sales was incremental expenses in 2008 related to the 2007 acquisitions of ethafoam® and related polyethylene foam product lines and alga plastics which amounted to approximately 54 million expenses included in cost of sales related to the implementation of gms were 7 million in 2008 compared with 11 million in 2007 these items were partially offset by the impact of expense control initiatives in 2008 

marketing administrative and development expenses 

the following table shows our marketing administrative and development expenses for the three years ended december 31 2009 



2009 compared with 2008 

marketing administrative and development expenses decreased 36 million in 2009 compared with 2008 these expenses decreased due to the following 

• estimated benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 including approximately 40 million of incremental benefits from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program lower travel and entertainment expenses and gms and • the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of 31 million these decreases were partially offset by higher management incentive compensation expenses of approximately 55 million in 2009 of which approximately 30 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009 because we exceeded our 2009 financial performance goals but did not meet our 2008 financial performance goals 

our management incentive compensation expense includes annual cash incentives our annual us profit sharing contribution and longterm sharebased compensation the table below shows the increase in these expenses in 2009 compared with 2008 



2008 compared with 2007 

marketing administrative and development expenses increased 5 million in 2008 compared with 2007 these expenses increased due to the following 

• the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 19 million • additional expenses of 5 million in 2008 related to businesses acquired in the second half of 2007 • an increase in provision for bad debt expense of 5 million substantially all in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily related to credit conditions affecting some of our food packaging and protective packaging customers and • additional operating expenses of 3 million in 2008 related to our new ventures businesses which includes spending related to innovation and new product introductions including spending related to renewable products these increases were largely offset by 

• lower management incentive compensation expenses of 22 million of which 14 million occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 because we did not meet our 2008 financial performance goals and • a decrease in information systems expenses of 6 million primarily due to expense control initiatives in 2008 gms and 2008 cost reduction and productivity program 

gms 

our gms expands our production capabilities in regions where demand for our products and services has been growing significantly additionally we are optimizing certain manufacturing platforms in north america and europe into centers of excellence the goals of this multiyear program have been to expand capacity in growing markets further improve our operating efficiencies and implement new technologies more effectively by taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale we have continued to enhance our profitable growth and our global leadership position and have produced meaningful benefits 

we announced the first phase of this multiyear global manufacturing strategy in july 2006 in 2009 we substantially finished the construction phase of gms with the launch of our manufacturing facility in duchnice poland this facility along with our other new facilities in qingpu china and monterrey mexico substantially completes the construction and launch of all three greenfield sites related to this program 

we estimate that we have realized benefits of approximately 25 million from gms in 2008 which increased to 45 million in 2009 we expect to realize an additional 10 million of benefits in 2010 bringing total estimated annual benefits to 55 million in 2010 and thereafter these benefits were primarily realized in cost of sales we anticipate pretax charges related to this program to be approximately 4 million in 2010 the actual timing of any future related costs is subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the spending and benefits to occur in future periods 

the capital expenditures associated costs and related restructuring charges and the total amounts incurred since inception of this multiyear strategy are included in the table below 



1 the associated costs principally include facility startup costs which are primarily included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations these charges by our reporting structure were as follows 



2 the restructuring and other charges were primarily for costs for termination benefits the majority of which were related to the food packaging segment these charges were included in restructuring and other charges on the consolidated statements of operations see note 3 segments for restructuring and other charges by reportable segment and other a reconciliation of the restructuring accrual for gms is included below 

of the 65 million of restructuring and other charges related to gms in 2009 52 million was for costs for termination benefits in connection with our decision to cease some of our manufacturing operations in norderstedt germany we intend to relocate our bagmaking and printing operations to other existing facilities in europe and plan to continue our production of medical products and maintain support functions in the norderstedt facility we estimate that we will incur total costs of approximately 70 million all of which will be paid in 2010 or later these estimated costs in connection with this action by major type consist of the following 



during 2009 we also recorded restructuring and other charges of 13 million primarily related to costs for termination benefits incurred in connection with other projects associated with gms 

during 2008 the restructuring and other charges of 193 million related to this program were primarily for costs for termination benefits related to our decision to close our manufacturing facility in cedar rapids iowa this facilitys manufacturing operations were moved to existing facilities in north america 

the components of the restructuring accrual for gms through december 31 2009 and the accrual balance remaining on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 were as follows 



we expect to pay 93 million of the accrual balance remaining at december 31 2009 in 2010 this amount is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 the 

remaining accrual of 01 million is expected to be paid in 2011 and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 

2008 cost reduction and productivity program 

in the third quarter of 2008 we implemented a cost reduction and productivity program as a result we recorded 658 million of pretax charges primarily for costs for termination benefits in 2008 the components of the restructuring accrual through december 31 2009 and the accrual balance remaining on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 related to this program are included in the table below we expect to incur additional modest costs associated with this program during 2010 



we expect to pay 65 million of the accrual balance remaining at december 31 2009 in 2010 this amount is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 the remaining accrual of 01 million is expected to be paid in 2011 and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009

 denotes a change equal to or greater than 100 1 restructuring and other charges by our segment reporting structure were as follows 



see global manufacturing strategy and 2008 cost reduction and productivity program above for further discussion of restructuring and other charges 

food packaging segment operating profit 

2009 compared with 2008 

the increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 80 million the favorable impact of product pricemix of 46 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately 16 million operating profit was also favorably impacted from benefits from gms and our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above these items were partially offset by the decline in unit volume discussed above 

expenses in this segment related to the implementation of gms were 8 million in 2009 compared with 4 million in 2008 

2008 compared with 2007 

the decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 60 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately 14 million these items were partially offset by the favorable impact of product pricemix of 62 million discussed above expenses in this segment related to the implementation of gms were 4 million in 2008 compared with 10 million in 2007 

food solutions segment operating profit 

2009 compared with 2008 

the increase in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower input costs including favorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 40 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately 7 million operating profit was also favorably impacted by benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above these items were partially offset by the decline in unit volume discussed above 

2008 compared with 2007 

the decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 20 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately 4 million these items were partially offset by the favorable impact product pricemix of 29 million discussed above 

protective packaging segment operating profit 

2009 compared with 2008 

the decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the decline in unit volume and unfavorable product pricemix both discussed above these items were partially offset by favorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 60 million freight and utilities costs of approximately 30 million operating profit was also favorably impacted from benefits from our expense control initiatives and other cost control measures in 2009 and 2008 as discussed above 

2008 compared with 2007 

the decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 30 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately 5 million also contributing to this decrease was the decline in unit volume which was partially offset by the favorable product pricemix of 21 million discussed above 

other operating profit 

2009 compared with 2008 

the decrease in operating profit in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the decline in unit volume in our specialty materials products discussed above partially offsetting this decline was favorable 

average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 20 million favorable product pricemix of approximately 9 million and favorable freight and utilities costs of approximately 7 million 

2008 compared with 2007 

the decrease in operating profit in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to higher input costs including unfavorable average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures of approximately 10 million and freight and utilities costs of approximately 10 million which included additional freight costs related to the ethafoam® foam product lines these higher input costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of product pricemix shown above this businesss operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by an interim supply and distribution agreement for the ethafoam® foam product lines we completed the construction of additional capacity in the united states to produce these products before the end of the interim agreement this businesss operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by the additional expenses related to innovation and new product introductions discussed above in marketing administrative and development expenses 

interest expense 

interest expense includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt as well as the net impact of capitalized interest the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs bond discounts and terminated treasury locks we expect to incur approximately 160 million of interest expense in 2010 which includes approximately 41 million of interest expense for a full year of accrued interest on the cash portion of the settlement agreement 

interest expense for the three years ended december 31 2009 was as follows 



loss on debt redemption 

in the third quarter of 2009 we redeemed the entire 4313 million of our 3 convertible senior notes due 2033 and recorded a 3 million pretax loss this loss represented a 0429 call premium of 2 million and a writedown of the remaining debt issuance costs of 1 million related to the issuance of these senior notes in july 2003 see note 11 debt and credit facilities of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

impairment of availableforsale securities 

our valuation of our auction rate security investments resulted in the recognition of other than temporary impairment of 4 million 2 million net of taxes in 2009 and 34 million 22 million net of taxes in 2008 see note 5 availableforsale investments of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

gain on sale of equity method investment 

in the first quarter of 2007 we sold our 50percent investment in polymask corporation to our joint venture partner 3m company the polymask transaction the joint venture was formed in 1991 to produce and sell nonpackaging surface protection films before the sale we accounted for this joint venture under the equity method of accounting we received an aggregate cash amount of 36 million for the transaction and other related assets and recorded a pretax gain of 35 million 22 million net of taxes in the first quarter of 2007 this gain was included in gain on the sale of equity method investment on the consolidated statement of operations our investment in this joint venture was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

other expense income net 

the following table provides details of our other expense income net 



interest and dividend income decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates received on our invested cash and to a lesser extent lower cash balances in interest bearing accounts 

interest and dividend income decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the use of available cash and cash equivalents to retire the 5375 senior notes on the date of their maturity and to a lesser extent lower interest rates received on our invested cash 

net foreign exchange transaction losses decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates in 2009 

net foreign exchange transaction losses increased in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar during the latter part of 2008 particularly against foreign currencies in developing markets 

income taxes 

our effective income tax rate was 259 for 2009 191 for 2008 and 226 for 2007 as described below in each of those years we recognized benefits for items that may not recur to the same extent in future years as such we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 27 for 2010 our 2010 effective tax rate may be higher if we fund the settlement agreement in 2010 we anticipate that funding the settlement agreement in 2010 will result in a loss for us income tax return purposes this loss will eliminate some tax benefits in 2010 primarily the domestic manufacturing deduction 

for 2009 our effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings and income tax benefits from tax credits and the domestic manufacturing deduction partially offset by state income taxes and an increase in accruals relating to uncertain tax positions see note 15 income taxes for a reconciliation of the us federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate which also shows the major components of the year over year changes 

for 2008 the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings and to a lesser extent the following items 

• a reduction in the estimated cost of repatriating certain foreign earnings • a change in assertion made with regard to certain undistributed foreign earnings • the reversal of tax accruals and related interest for contingencies that did not materialize following the completion of tax audits and • the utilization of loss carryforwards in a foreign jurisdiction for which no benefit had previously been recognized for financial reporting purposes for 2007 the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to the reversal of tax accruals and related interest and to a lesser extent the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings partially offset by state income taxes

• a description of our material commitments and contingencies • a description of our principal sources of liquidity • a description of our outstanding indebtedness • an analysis of our historical cash flows and changes in working capital • a description of our derivative financial instruments and • a description of changes in our stockholders equity material commitments and contingencies 

settlement agreement and related costs 

we recorded a charge of 8501 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 of which 5125 million represents a cash payment that we are required to make subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of wr grace  co we did not use cash in any period with respect to this liability the bankruptcy court has conducted hearings to consider confirmation of the pi settlement plan and has heard closing arguments with respect to the pi settlement plan but additional hearings may be held by the bankruptcy court and the district court to consider matters related to the pi settlement plan we do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement we currently expect to fund this payment by using a combination of accumulated cash and cash equivalents future cash flows from operations and funds available under our global credit facility our european facility or our accounts receivable securitization program described below the cash payment of 5125 million accrues interest at a 55 annual rate which is compounded annually from december 21 2002 to the date of payment we have recorded this accrued interest in settlement agreement and related accrued interest on our consolidated balance sheets and these amounts were 2343 at december 31 2009 and 1953 million at december 31 2008

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and sets forth the amounts of required or contingently required cash outlays in 2010 and future years amounts in millions 



1 these amounts include principal maturities at face value only these amounts also include our contractual obligations under capital leases of 63 million in 2010 76 million in 20112012 and 03 million in 20132014 2 includes interest payments required under our senior notes issuances only 3 this liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 55 per annum compounded annually until it becomes due and payable 

current portion of longterm debt and longterm debt —the debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of december 31 2009 and therefore represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period 

operating leases —the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under noncancelable real and personal property leases as of december 31 2009 

cash portion of the settlement agreement —the settlement agreement is described more fully in settlement agreement and related costs of note 16 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 

other principal contractual obligations —other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods including raw materials or services including energy in the normal course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase 

liability for unrecognized tax benefits 

at december 31 2009 we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of 11 million which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2009 

we cannot reasonably estimate the future period or periods of cash settlement of these liabilities see note 15 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have reviewed our offbalance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources at december 31 2009 we had no amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program see note 6 accounts receivable securitization program of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

income tax payments 

we currently expect to pay between 100 million and 110 million in income taxes in 2010 this range would be adjusted if the settlement agreement were to become effective in 2010 

contributions to defined benefit pension plans 

we maintain defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of our us employees and for some of our nonus employees we currently expect employer contributions to be approximately 12 million in 2010 

termination benefit payments 

in connection with our gms and 2008 cost reduction and productivity program we currently expect to pay approximately 16 million of termination benefits in 2010 

environmental matters 

we are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated statements of operations balance sheets or cash flows we reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs we evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated we adjust the recorded accruals as necessary we believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations we believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

principal sources of liquidity 

we require cash to fund our operating expenses capital expenditures interest taxes and dividend payments and to pay our debt obligations and other longterm liabilities as they come due our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations accumulated cash and amounts available under our existing lines of credit described below including the global credit facility and the european credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization program 

in 2009 we redeemed the entire 4313 million of our 3 convertible senior notes retired all of our outstanding 695 senior notes and issued 400 million of 7875 senior notes and 300 million of 12 senior notes we believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations including all of the items mentioned above and the cash payment under the settlement agreement should it become payable within the next 12 months 

with respect to the settlement agreement we do not know whether or when a final plan of reorganization for grace will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement graces pi settlement plan is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions including the availability of exit financing and the approval of both the bankruptcy court and united states district court for the district of delaware resulting in uncertainty as to when the plan might become effective 

tax benefits resulting from the payment made under the settlement agreement which are currently recorded as deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets are anticipated to provide approximately 350 million of current and future cash tax benefits at the time the payment under the settlement agreement is made the amount and timing of future cash tax benefits could vary depending on the amount of cash paid by us and various facts and circumstances at the time of payment under the settlement agreement including the price of our common stock our tax position and the applicable tax codes 

cash and cash equivalents 

the following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents 



see analysis of historical cash flows below 

lines of credit 

the following table summarizes our available lines of credit and committed and uncommitted lines of credit including the global credit facility and the european credit facility discussed below at december 31 2009 and 2008 



our principal credit lines were committed and consisted of the global credit facility and the european credit facility we are not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with our lines of credit 

global credit facility 

the global credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including the payment of amounts required to be paid upon the effectiveness of the settlement agreement we may reborrow amounts repaid under the global credit facility from time to time before the expiration or earlier termination of the global credit facility our obligations under the global credit facility bear interest at floating rates which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period the global credit facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on our longterm senior unsecured debt ratings the facility has an expiration date of july 26 2012 

the terms of this facility include a requirement that upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement agreement or would materially increase our liability in respect of the grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the cryovac transaction we would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under the global credit facility or refinance the facility within 60 days 

before december 10 2009 the global credit facility commitments included 28 million provided by lehman commercial paper inc a subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings inc as a result of the 

bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers holdings inc and certain of its subsidiaries in september 2008 lehman commercial paper was no longer funding borrowing requests under the global credit facility effective december 10 2009 we removed lehman commercial papers commitments from the global credit facility and as a result as of december 31 2009 the total amount available under the global credit facility was approximately 472 million 

while the current total amount available for borrowing under the global credit facility is approximately 472 million the facility also provides a mechanism to increase the total facility size to a maximum of 750 million this does not represent a commitment by the lenders to increase the facility size rather it provides us with a simplified method of requesting an increase at a later date if desired and market conditions permit this mechanism is not included in the available lines of credit table above 

facility fees are payable at the rate of 020 per annum on the total amounts available under the revolving credit facility the global credit facility provides for changes in facility fees based on our longterm senior unsecured debt ratings also the facility provides for springing subsidiary guarantees if our longterm senior unsecured debt ratings by both moodys and standard  poors fall below investment grade 

during 2009 we borrowed funds from time to time under this facility interest expense related to the funds drawn in 2009 was 02 million the related weighted average interest rate for these borrowings was 17 at december 31 2009 there were no amounts outstanding under this facility 

european credit facility 

in november 2009 we entered into a €150 million european credit facility equivalent to us 214 million at december 31 2009 the facility has an expiration date of july 26 2012 a syndicate of banks made this facility available to sealed air and a group of our european subsidiaries for general corporate purposes including the payment of amounts required to be paid upon effectiveness of the settlement agreement we may reborrow amounts repaid under the european credit facility from time to time before the expiration or earlier termination of the facility the terms of this facility are substantially similar to the terms of our global credit facility as of december 31 2009 we had an outstanding balance of €45 million which was equivalent to us 64 million we repaid this outstanding balance in january 2010 interest expense related to the funds drawn in 2009 was 01 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 3625 

in december 2009 after entering into the european credit facility we cancelled our 170 million australian dollar revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in march 2010 we did not utilize the australian facility in 2009 

other lines of credit 

substantially all our shortterm borrowings of 28 million at december 31 2009 and 38 million at december 31 2008 were outstanding under lines of credit available to several of our foreign subsidiaries the following table details our other lines of credit at december 31 2009 and 2008 



see note 11 debt and credit facilities of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our outstanding longterm debt and available lines of credit 

accounts receivable securitization program 

we and a group of our us subsidiaries maintain an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank as of december 31 2009 the maximum purchase limit for receivable interests was 125 million the amounts available from time to time under the program may be less than 125 million due to a number of factors including but not limited to our credit ratings accounts receivable balances the creditworthiness of our customers and our receivables collection experience 

during 2009 the level of eligible assets available under the program declined primarily due to our current credit rating as a result the amount available to us under the program was approximately 74 million at december 31 2009 although we do not believe that these restrictive provisions presently materially restrict our operations if an event occurs that triggers one of these restrictive provisions we could experience a further decline in the amounts available under the program or termination of the program 

the program is scheduled to expire in december 2012 the program includes a bank financing commitment that must be renewed annually before the expiration date the bank financing commitment is scheduled to expire on december 3 2010 we plan to seek an additional 364 day renewal of the bank financing commitment before its expiration but the bank is not obligated to renew the bank financing commitment 

at december 31 2009 we had no amounts outstanding under this program 

see note 6 accounts receivable securitization program of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning this program 

covenants 

at december 31 2009 we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations as discussed in covenants of note 11 debt and credit facilities of notes to consolidated financial statements 

debt ratings 

our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings which the credit rating agencies review periodically the company and our longterm senior unsecured debt are currently rated bb stable outlook by standard  poors this rating is considered noninvestment grade the company and our longterm senior unsecured debt are currently rated baa3 negative outlook by moodys this rating is considered investment grade if our credit ratings are downgraded there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

outstanding indebtedness 

at december 31 2009 and 2008 our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table see note 11 debt and credit facilities of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt 



analysis of historical cash flow 

the following table summarizes the changes in our cash flows for the three years ended december 31 2009 



 denotes a variance greater than 100 

net cash provided by operating activities 

2009 compared with 2008 

the 148 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was primarily due to the following factors 

• a decrease in receivables net of 156 million in 2009 which was attributable to both lower sales and a decline in dayssalesoutstanding in 2009 • a decrease in inventories of 141 million in 2009 primarily due to managements efforts to maintain lower inventory levels and the benefit of lower average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures experienced in 2009 and • an increase in net earnings adjusted for noncash items of 77 million in 2009 these factors were partially offset by the following 

• a decrease of net cash of 160 million resulting from the repurchases in 2009 and sales in 2008 of receivable interests under our accounts receivable securitization program we used available cash of 80 million to fund the repurchase of receivable interests in 2009 compared with the receipt of 80 million in cash from the sale of receivable interests in 2008 • an increase in cash used for accounts payable of 40 million due to the timing of payments • an increase in accrued interest related to the settlement agreement of 39 million and • an increase in cash used for the payment of termination benefits of 24 million in 2009 in connection with our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and gms cash payments for termination benefits were 48 million in 2009 compared with 24 million in 2008 2008 compared with 2007 

the 26 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was primarily due to the following factors 

• an increase in other current liabilities of 114 million in 2008 primarily due to the following • a decrease in cash used for income taxes payable of 93 million in 2008 income tax payments were 91 million in 2008 compared with 202 million in 2007 the decrease in income tax payments in 2008 primarily resulted from lower estimated taxable income for 2008 and • an increase in accrued restructuring costs of 44 million in 2008 primarily reflecting additional net accrued termination costs recorded in connection with our 2008 cost reduction program and to a lesser extent gms partially offset by 

• a decrease in accrued payroll of 23 million in 2008 primarily reflecting lower management incentive compensation in 2008 and • the utilization of 80 million available to us under our accounts receivable securitization program in 2008 as discussed above these items were partially offset by 

• a decrease in net earnings adjusted for noncash items of 118 million in 2008 and • an increase in cash used for accounts payable of 46 million in 2008 primarily due to the timing of payments net cash used in investing activities 

2009 compared with 2008 

the 106 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures of 100 million in 2009 compared with 2008 during 2009 we completed the construction phase of gms with the launch of our manufacturing facility in poland 

2008 compared with 2007 

the 97 million decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the following 

• a decrease in cash used for acquisitions of 73 million in 2008 and • a decrease of 30 million in capital expenditures in 2008 primarily due to the timing of the completion of some new capacity projects in 2008 these items were partially offset by cash received of 36 million in 2007 from the polymask transaction 

we expect to continue to invest capital as we deem appropriate to expand our business to maintain or replace depreciating property plant and equipment to acquire new manufacturing technology and to improve productivity since we have substantially finished the construction phase associated with gms we expect total capital expenditures in 2010 to be in the range of 80 million to 100 million this projected range is comparable to the annual level of capital expenditures incurred before commencing gms in 2006 this projection is based upon our capital expenditure budget for 2010 the status of approved but not yet completed capital projects anticipated future projects and historic spending trends 

net cash provided by used in financing activities 

2009 compared with 2008 

in 2009 our financing activities provided a net 90 million of cash and cash equivalents primarily due to the following activities 

• issuance of 400 million of 7875 senior notes due june 2017 • issuance of 300 million of 12 senior notes due february 2014 • funds drawn of 64 million under our european credit facility partially offset by 

• redemption of the entire 4313 million of our 3 convertible senior notes • retirement of the remaining outstanding balance of 137 million of our 695 senior notes and • dividend payments of 76 million in 2008 our financing activities resulted in a net usage of 563 million of cash and cash equivalents which was primarily due to 

• retirement of our 5375 senior notes with a face value of 300 million • purchase of 91 million in aggregate principal amount of the 695 senior notes • repurchases of our common stock of 95 million and • dividend payments of 76 million 2008 compared with 2007 

the 503 million increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the following 

• an increase in net longterm debt repayments of 390 million in 2008 primarily due to the retirement of our 5375 senior notes with a face value of 300 million in april 2008 and the purchase of 91 million in aggregate principal amount of our 695 senior notes • an increase in cash used for the repurchase of our common stock of 88 million in 2008 as discussed below and • an increase in cash used for the payment of common stock dividends of 12 million in 2008 primarily due to the increase in dividends paid per common share in 2008 repurchases of capital stock 

during 2009 we did not repurchase any shares of common stock during 2008 we repurchased 4 million shares of our common stock par value 010 per share in open market purchases at a cost of 

95 million the average price per share of these common stock repurchases was 2364 during 2007 we repurchased 02 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases at a cost of 7 million the average price per share of these common stock repurchases was 3158 all repurchases have been adjusted for the twoforone stock split in march 2007 

we made the share repurchases in 2008 under the share repurchase program adopted by our board of directors in august 2007 when the board of directors authorized us to repurchase in the aggregate up to 20 million shares of its issued and outstanding common stock this program replaced our prior share repurchase program which ended in august 2007 the current program has no set expiration date and we may from time to time continue to repurchase our common stock see item 5 issuer purchases of equity securities for further information on the share repurchase program 

changes in working capital 



the increase in working capital in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to the following 

• an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 566 million see analysis of historical cash flows above for details of the factors that contributed to the increase in cash and cash equivalents • a decrease in current portion of longterm debt of 145 million this decrease was primarily due to the retirement of the remaining 1367 million 695 senior notes in may 2009 and • a decrease in accounts payable of 63 million which primarily reflected lower purchases of raw materials as a result of lower volumes of net sales and lower raw material unit costs experienced in 2009 and • a decrease in accrued restructuring costs of 34 million primarily due to payments made for termination benefits accrued in connection with our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program these items were partially offset by 

• a decrease in inventories of 95 million excluding the impact of foreign currency translation of 21 million inventories would have decreased 116 million primarily due to managements efforts to maintain lower inventory levels and the benefit of lower average petrochemicalbased raw material expenditures experienced in 2009 • a decrease in deferred taxes of 54 million due to a reclassification of a portion of the deferred tax asset related to the settlement agreement to noncurrent based on the current anticipated timing of the related tax benefit • an increase in accrued interest of 39 million related to the settlement agreement and • an increase in other current liabilities of 27 million primarily due to an increase in accrued payroll reflecting higher 2009 accruals for management incentive compensation expenses foreign currency translation had a net favorable impact on working capital of approximately 32 million

• net earnings of 244 million and • positive foreign currency translation of 72 million the items above were partially offset by dividends paid and accrued on our common stock of 78 million in 2009 

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

we are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards of notes to consolidated financial statements which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include our officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel experts and actuaries in addition we use internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of accounts receivable as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards of notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts which is included in marketing administrative and development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations these changes may reflect changes in economic business and market conditions the allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of chargeoffs net of recoveries 

the provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including but not limited to a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances the length of time a receivable is past due and our historical experience with our customers in circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known we record a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount we reasonably assess will be collected if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to pay our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount 

fair value measurements 

in determining fair value of financial instruments we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value we determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs which are categorized in one of the following levels 

• level 1 inputs unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date • level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability • level 3 inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available thereby allowing for situations in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date our fair value measurements for our financial instruments such as our investments in auction rate securities are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates see note 13 fair value measurements and other financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statement for further details on our fair value measurements

on an ongoing basis we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses we consider insurance recoveries if any we expense legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred we have in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or otherwise provided further information on which we could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability and we expect to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the 

eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made 

impairment of longlived assets 

the determination of the value of longlived assets requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements we periodically review longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 

assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses such as future cash flows which are based on operational performance market conditions and other factors and disposition costs may affect the carrying value of longlived assets and result in possible impairment expense in our consolidated financial statements as assumptions and estimates change in the future we may be required to record an impairment charge 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year a review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 

a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment—the component level—discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment in which case the component is the reporting unit 

we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment we must recognize a noncash impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and two market approaches each based on an applicable weighting we assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting units fair value fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows effective income tax rates comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units assumptions for sales net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

income approach used to determine fair values 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis we use a discount rate that reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value longterm growth rates provisions for income taxes future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless debtfree working capital 

market approaches used to determine fair values 

we use two market approaches the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting units operating performance 

these multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the company the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under the two market approaches includes trailing and future 12month operating performance results and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied under both market approaches a control premium or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

see note 9 goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2009 and other related information 

pensions 

we maintain a noncontributory profit sharing plan and a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most us employees are eligible to participate for a limited number of our us employees and for some of our international employees we maintain defined benefit pension plans under current accounting standards we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planbyplan basis each fiscal year the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases we revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits 

in determining the discount rate we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on our asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment we believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on our longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 

at december 31 2009 the projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans was 17 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2009 was 4 million at december 31 2009 the projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was 86 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2009 was 18 million 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our consolidated financial statements a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases in the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2009 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2010 in millions 





  



  



income taxes 

estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards we evaluate whether our taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely we provide a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities we adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 15 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments we do not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time we may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

our interest rate swaps are described in note 12 derivatives and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—derivative financial instruments—interest rate swaps contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k such information is incorporated herein by reference 

at december 31 2009 we had outstanding interest rate swaps but no outstanding collars or options at december 31 2008 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps collars or options 

the carrying value of our total debt which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps in 2009 was 16610 million at december 31 2009 and 14790 million at december 31 2008 our fixed rate debt including the impact of interest rate swaps in 2009 was 15686 million at december 31 2009 and 14309 million at december 31 2008 the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the estimated fair value of our total debt including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps in 2009 was 17747 million at december 31 2009 and 12048 million at december 31 2008 a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of 669 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2009 these changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt do not alter our obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt 

see note 13 fair value measurements and other financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the methodology and inputs used to determine the fair value of our fixed rate debt 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as a large global organization we face exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations in the future 

the translation of the financial statements of our nonus operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the change in net sales and operating income was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into us dollars this resulted in a decrease in net sales of 242 million and increased operating profit by 26 million in 2009 compared with 2008 

recent economic events in venezuela have exposed us to heightened levels of foreign currency exchange risk effective january 1 2010 venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy and the us dollar replaced the bolivar fuerte as the functional currency for our subsidiary in venezuela in accordance with us gaap a highly inflationary economy is one that has a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over a threeyear period we determined the cumulative inflation rate using a blended inflation rate which included the national consumer price index known as the ncpi and the consumer price index known as the cpi the cpi is only based on the metropolitan areas of caracas and maracaibo in venezuela and the ncpi is based on the entire country of venezuela 

once a country is designated to be a highly inflationary economy the remeasurement method must be used which is also called the monetarynonmonetary method all bolivardenominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into us dollars using the current exchange rate and any changes in foreign currency are reflected in other expense income on the consolidated statement of operations all bolivardenominated nonmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into us dollars using the historical exchange rates 

the potential future impact to our consolidated financial position and results of operations for future bolivardenominated transactions will depend on the exchange rates in effect when we enter into remeasure and settle transactions therefore it is difficult to predict the future impact until each transaction settles at its applicable exchange rate or gets remeasured into us dollars 

at december 31 2009 our subsidiary in venezuela had net assets of approximately 8 million for the year ended december 31 2009 less than 1 of our consolidated net sales and less than 3 of our consolidated operating profit was derived from our business in venezuela accordingly we do not expect the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on some transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2009 would have caused us to pay approximately 356 million to terminate these contracts 

our foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 12 derivatives and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements which is contained in part ii item 8 and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—derivative financial instruments—foreign currency forward contracts contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k such information is incorporated herein by reference 

we may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2009 and 2008 we had no foreign exchange options and currency swap agreements outstanding 

our outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary we believe that this enables us to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 1090 million at december 31 2009 and 485 million at december 31 2008 

availableforsale investments 

our availableforsale investments consisting of auction rate securities at december 31 2009 and 2008 are exposed to market risk related to changes in conditions in the us financial markets and in the financial condition of the issuers of these securities our investment in auction rate securities at december 31 2009 and 2008 had an original cost of 447 million debt instruments of 247 million and noncumulative 

perpetual preferred stock of 200 million as of december 31 2009 the estimated fair value of our investments in auction rate securities was 137 million 

these auction rate securities consisted of two contingent capital securities that were converted into perpetual preferred stock of ambac assurance corporation ambac the issuer in december 2008 and three debt instruments issued individually by primus financial products llc primus maturity date 2021 river lake insurance company river lake a whollyowned subsidiary of genworth financial inc maturity date 2033 and ballantyne re plc ballantyne maturity date 2036 we received interest and dividend payments of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2009 and 22 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

these five securities historically were reauctioned every twentyeight days which had provided a liquid market for them however as a result of continuing liquidity concerns for these types of assetbacked securities every auction held by the issuers for these auction rate securities since late 2007 has failed 

we account for these investments as availableforsale investments on a securitybysecurity basis and determine whether a decline in fair value below its cost is temporary or other than temporary the objective of other than temporary impairment analysis under us gaap is to determine whether the holder of an investment in a debt or equity security for which changes in fair value are not regularly recognized in earnings should recognize a loss in earnings when the investment is impaired an investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost 

since august 2007 the estimated fair value of each of our investments in auction rate securities has been less than its original cost as a result we have recognized cumulative losses of 380 million 238 million net of taxes through december 31 2009 from the decline in market values from the securities original cost after considering impairment indicators under us gaap and the declines in fair value we determined that these investments were impaired we evaluated the following factors in determining whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary 

• the creditworthiness of the issuers and the timelines and level of interest payments received from the issuers • downgrades of credit ratings of all of the issuers • the severity of the decline in the estimated market value of the securities in 2008 and 2009 • potential recovery of the investment value • ambacs december 2008 exercise of its put option to convert its asset backed capital commitment securities into noncumulative perpetual preferred stock of ambac assurance no maturity date • ambacs december 2008 cancellation of the dividend on its common stock • ambacs cancellation of the dividend on its noncumulative preferred stock effective august 1 2009 and • the level of subordination of the ballantyne securities based on the evaluations discussed above we determined that the securities incurred other than temporary decline in fair market value we also recorded 70 million of unrealized gains 44 million net of taxes in 2009 in other comprehensive income related to an increase in the estimated fair value of the river lake securities following their initial decline in value which was primarily due to an improvement in river lakes credit spread 

see note 13 fair value measurements and other financial instruments for details on the inputs and valuation methodology used to calculate the estimated fair value of these investments 

we continue to monitor developments in the market for auction rate securities including the specific securities in which we have invested at december 31 2009 ratings of the securities held by us by moodys ranged from baa3 to unrated and ratings by standard  poors ranged from bbb to d these ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment and noninvestment grade longterm unsecured debt moreover during the year ended december 31 2009 we continued to receive all interest payments totaling 08 million on a timely basis from the issuers of the three debt securities 

effective august 1 2009 ambac discontinued paying dividends on its perpetual preferred stock during the year ended december 31 2009 we received dividend payments totaling 03 million from ambac 

if credit or liquidity conditions relating to these securities or the issuers worsen we may recognize additional other than temporary impairments which would result in the recognition of additional losses on our consolidated statement of operations we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating cash needs without the sale of these securities 

customer credit 

we are exposed to credit risk from our customers in the normal course of business we extend credit to our customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio 

our customers may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons despite uncertainties surrounding global economic conditions and levels of credit risk since the second half of 2007 we have not experienced a significant adverse change in our customers payment patterns or defaults our provision for bad debt expense was 6 million in 2009 9 million in 2008 and 3 million in 2007 

pensions 

recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks and shortterm liquidity concerns associated with some of the plan assets held by our defined benefit pension plans which have impacted the performance of some of the plan assets based upon the annual valuation of our defined benefit pension plans at december 31 2009 we expect our net periodic benefit costs to be approximately 20 million in 2010 which is comparable to prior years costs see note 14 profit sharing retirement savings plans and defined benefit pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our defined benefit pension plans 

commodities 

we use various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with our manufacturing processes generally we acquire these components at market prices in the region in which they will be used and do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover we seek to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories we do not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result we are exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

the company has no material longterm contracts for the distribution of its products in 2008 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of the companys consolidated net sales 

although historically net sales of food packaging food solutions and protective packaging products tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher in the fourth quarter the company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business or to any reportable business segment 

competition 

competition for most of the companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership there are other companies producing competing products that are well established 

there are other manufacturers of food packaging and food solutions products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic paper metals and other materials the company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which it offers those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which it offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the united states 

the companys protective packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts loose fill packaging materials strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials as well as various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts and wood blocking and bracing systems the company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging suspension and retention packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which it sells these products 

competition in specialty materials is focused on performance characteristics and price competition for most of the companys medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price technical design capability is an additional competitive factor for the rigid packaging offered by the medical applications business 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in each of the companys reportable business segments are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films and paper and wood pulp products the company also purchases corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap® brand cushioning inks for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition the company offers a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which it manufactures or has manufactured to its specifications some of which it assembles and some of which it purchases from other suppliers 

the raw materials for the companys products generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several suppliers however the company has some solesource suppliers and the reduction in the availability of supplies could have a disproportionately negative impact on the company natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for the companys raw materials 

curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by the companys suppliers some materials used in the companys packaging products are sourced from materials recycled in the companys manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs 

research and development activities 

the company maintains a continuing effort to develop new products and to improve its existing products and processes including developing new packaging and nonpackaging applications for its products from time to time the company also acquires and commercializes new packaging and other products or techniques developed by others the companys research and development projects rely on its technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science package design and equipment engineering the company spent 856 million for companysponsored research and development in 2008 compared with 908 million during 2007 and 782 million during 2006 

patents and trademarks 

the company is the owner or licensee of a number of united states and foreign patents patent applications trademarks and trademark registrations that relate to many of its products manufacturing processes and equipment the company believes that its patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage none of the companys reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather the company believes that its success depends primarily on its sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on its ongoing research and development efforts the company believes that the expiration or unenforceability of any of its patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to the companys business or consolidated financial position 

environmental matters 

as a manufacturer the company is subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which it operates covering the release of materials into the environment regarding standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment the company reviews environmental laws and regulations pertaining to its operations and believes that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the companys capital expenditures or consolidated financial position 

in some jurisdictions in which the companys packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things recycled or reprocessed content and sale or disposal of packaging materials in addition customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that incorporate renewable materials or that are otherwise viewed as being environmentally sound the companys new ventures activities described above emphasize the development of packaging products from renewable resources the company maintains programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations to monitor their evolution and to meet this customer demand these issues can be a competitive advantage for the company given the inherent source reduction benefits of many of its processes and products one advantage inherent in many of the companys products is that thin lightweight packaging solutions reduce customer waste and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives the company continues to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they become available 

the company also supports its customers interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of the companys products or product packaging and for materials used in some of the companys products when possible materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in the companys protective packaging operations or offered to other manufacturers for use in other products in addition recent gains made in internal recycling programs have allowed the company to improve its net raw material yield thus mitigating the impact of resin costs while lowering solid waste disposal costs 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 the company had approximately 17000 employees worldwide approximately 6700 of these employees were in the us with approximately 400 of these covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 10300 company employees who were outside the us approximately 7500 were covered by collective bargaining agreements outside of the us many of the covered employees

weakened global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position and results of operations 

weakened global economic conditions can have an adverse impact on the companys business in the form of lower sales due to weakened demand unfavorable changes in product pricemix and lower profit margins 

during periods of economic recession there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices if the company loses significant sales volume or reduces its selling prices signficantly then there could be a negative impact on the companys revenue profitability and cash flows 

also reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of the companys customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures this could negatively impact the companys ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as its sales of materials and equipment to affected customers and could result in reduced collections of outstanding accounts receivable 

the disruption and volatility of the financial and credit markets could affect external liquidity sources for the company 

the companys principal sources of liquidity are accumulated cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flow from operations and amounts available under its existing lines of credit including its revolving credit facility the anz facility and its accounts receivable securitization program as described below in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the companys 695 senior notes are due on may 15 2009 furthermore the company may be obligated to make the payment under the settlement agreement and related accrued interest in 2009 although there is no certainty that the payment will be due in 2009 on june 30 2010 the holders of the companys 3 convertible senior notes have the option to require the company to repurchase those notes these items are in addition to capital expenditures and other uses of cash that the company may incur while the company projects that it should have sufficient liquidity to fund these obligations as well as its operating and investing cash requirements from current sources the company may need to raise additional funds from external sources if the financial and credit markets continue to experience disruption and volatility the company may experience difficulty obtaining external funding and could incur increased financing costs 

additionally current conditions in financial markets including the bankruptcy and restructuring of certain financial institutions could affect financial institutions with which the company has relationships and could result in adverse effects on the companys ability to fully utilize its committed borrowing facilities for example another lender under the revolving credit facility may be unwilling or unable to fund a borrowing request and the company may not be able to replace such lender 

covenant restrictions under the companys credit arrangements may pose a risk 

the company has a number of credit facilities including its revolving credit facility and its anz facility and also has an accounts receivable securitization program and has issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations the agreements relating to these facilities and securities generally contain certain restrictive covenants including the incurrence of additional indebtedness restriction of liens and sale and leaseback transactions financial covenants relating to interest coverage debt leverage and minimum liquidity and restrictions on consolidation and merger transactions as well as in some cases restrictions on amendments to the settlement agreement although the company does not believe that any of these covenants presently materially restricts its operations a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in material adverse consequences that could negatively impact the business consolidated results of operations and financial position of the company such adverse consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering the obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by the companys lenders refusal by lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or new facilities or the lowering or modification of the companys credit ratings 

a downgrade of the companys credit ratings could have a negative impact on the companys costs and ability to access credit markets 

in january 2009 standard  poors revised the companys longterm senior unsecured debt rating from bbb to bb and revised the outlook to stable the revised rating is considered below investment grade the companys longterm senior unsecured debt rating is currently rated baa3 negative outlook by moodys investors service inc this rating is considered investment grade if the companys credit ratings are further downgraded there could be a negative impact on the companys ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase 

the global nature of the companys operations in the united states and in 51 foreign countries exposes it to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect its consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the company operates in the united states and in 51 other countries and its products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world a large portion of the companys manufacturing operations are located outside of the united states operations outside of the united states particularly operations in emerging markets are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for the companys us operations economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which the company operates including emerging markets could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from the companys operations in those areas 

risks inherent in the companys international operations include social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions exchange controls foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations including devaluations the potential for changes in local economic conditions including local inflationary pressures restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters including antidumping duties tariffs embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures changes in laws and regulations including the laws and policies of the united states affecting trade and foreign investment the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils the potential for nationalization of enterprises and unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against united states or other interests in addition there are potential tax inefficiencies in repatriating funds from the companys nonus subsidiaries 

these and other factors may have a material adverse effect on the companys international operations and consequently on the companys consolidated financial position and results of operations 

strengthening of the us dollar and other foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact the companys consolidated financial position and results of operations 

during 2008 approximately 55 of the companys sales originated outside the united states the company translates sales and other results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for the consolidated financial statements during periods of a strengthening us dollar the companys reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer u s dollars 

also while the company generally produces in the same geographic markets as its products are sold expenses are relatively concentrated in the united states compared with sales so that in a time of strengthening of the us dollar the companys profit margins could be reduced while the company uses financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures this does not insulate the company completely from currency effects 

the company may use financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which use exposes the company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance see note 12 derivatives and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the full realization of the companys deferred tax assets including primarily those related to the settlement agreement and the other than temporary impairment of the companys investments in auction rate securities may be affected by a number of factors 

the company has deferred tax assets related to the settlement agreement the other than temporary impairment of its investments in auction rate securities other accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes foreign net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax allowances employee benefit items and other items it has established valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized the companys ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends in part upon its future operating results and the availability of tax planning strategies the company expects to realize these assets over an extended period consequently changes in tax laws assumptions and the effectiveness of tax planning strategies could cause actual results to differ from projections 

the companys largest deferred tax asset relates to its settlement agreement including accrued interest the value of this asset may be affected by the companys tax situation at the time of the payment under the settlement agreement as well as by the value of the companys common stock at that time the deferred tax asset reflects the fair market value of 18 million shares of the companys common stock at a postsplit price of 1786 per share based on the price when the settlement agreement was reached in 2002 

the companys annual effective tax rate can materially change as a result of changes in mix of earnings and other factors 

the companys overall effective tax rate is equal to the companys total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax however tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis changes in statutory tax rates and laws and ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by the company also changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes among other factors could have a significant effect on the companys overall effective tax rate 

the company experiences competition in its operating segments and in the geographic areas in which it operates 

the companys products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types of materials or products the company competes on the basis of performance characteristics of its products as well as service price and innovations in technology a number of competing domestic and foreign companies are strong wellestablished companies the companys inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volume which would have a negative impact on the companys consolidated financial position and results of operations 

a slowing pipeline of new technologies and solutions at favorable margins could adversely affect the companys performance and prospects for future growth 

the companys competitive advantage is due in part to the ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins the development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment new products may not meet sales expectations or margin expectations due to many factors including the companys inability to accurately predict demand enduser preferences and evolving industry standards to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies 

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as mad cow disease footandmouth disease and avian influenza or birdflu as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues for the company 

the company manufactures and sells food packaging and food solutions products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging and food solutions products in recent years occasional cases of mad cow disease have been confirmed and incidents of bird flu have continued to surface in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases such as mad cow or footandmouth disease for example may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for the companys products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant 

numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging and food solutions products by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position and results of operations 

a major loss of or disruption in the companys manufacturing and distribution operations or its information systems and telecommunication resources could adversely affect the companys business 

if the company experienced a natural disaster such as tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes or other severe weather events or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood at one of its larger strategic facilities or if such event affected a key supplier the companys supply chain or its information systems and telecommunication resources then there could be a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations 

the price of the companys common stock has on occasion experienced significant price and volume fluctuations the sale of substantial amounts of the companys common stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock one stockholder has beneficial ownership of approximately 37 of the companys common shares 

the market price of the companys common stock has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations greater than those experienced by the broader stock market in addition the companys announcements of its quarterly operating results future developments relating to the w r grace  co bankruptcy additional litigation against the company the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues spikes in raw material and energyrelated costs changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting the company its customers suppliers and competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 

the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of the companys common stock in the public market could adversely affect the price of the common stock according to a schedule 13ga filed with the sec dated as of february 12 2009 davis selected advisers lp reported beneficial ownership of 57784149 shares or approximately 37 of the outstanding shares of the companys common stock 

while the schedule 13ga filed by davis selected advisers indicates that the beneficiallyowned shares of the companys common stock were not acquired for the purpose of changing or influencing the control of the company if that stockholder were to change its purpose for holding the companys common stock from investment to attempting to change or influence the management of the company this concentration of the companys common stock could potentially affect the company and the price of its common stock also davis selected advisers has a significant voting block with respect to matters submitted to a stockholder vote including the election of directors and the approval of potential business combination transactions 

the companys ability to successfully achieve the targeted benefits associated with its cost reduction and productivity program and its global manufacturing strategy could affect its consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the company is in various stages of completion of a cost reduction and productivity program and its global manufacturing strategy the goals of these initiatives include the expansion of capacity in growing markets better operating efficiencies a lower cost structure more effective technology implementation and increased productivity there can be no assurances that the estimated costs savings or efficiencies will materialize to the extent intended there are risks inherent in undertaking such programs including the sustainability of developing markets shifts in customer preferences competitive forces and technologies cost overruns and unanticipated consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the current weakness in the financial and credit markets and other factors could potentially lead to the carrying amount of the companys goodwill and other longlived assets becoming impaired and its investments in auction rate securities becoming further impaired 

at december 31 2008 the companys goodwill balance was 19381 million in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets the company performs an annual impairment review of goodwill which it does during the fourth quarter of each year and at other times if events and circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may potentially be no longer 

recoverable the company uses a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment the company must recognize an impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the company derives an estimate of fair values for each of the companys reporting units using a combination of an income approach and two market approaches each based on an applicable weighting the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the company uses two market approaches the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying ebitda as defined in footnote 5 to item 6 selected financial data multiples to the reporting units operating performance the ebitda multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common shares of the company and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable ebitda multiples of the company 

the company has completed step one of its impairment test and fair value analysis for goodwill and there were no impairments present and no impairment charge was recorded during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 although the company determined that there was no goodwill impairment in 2008 the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment such as a decrease in expected earnings adverse equity market conditions a decline in current market multiples a decline in the companys common stock price a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of could require an interim assessment for some or all of the reporting units prior to the next required annual assessment in the event of significant adverse changes of the nature described above the company might have to recognize a noncash impairment of goodwill which could have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position and results of operations 

the company recorded a 340 million pretax charge in 2008 as a result of recognizing impairment related to an other than temporary decline in the fair market value of its auction rate securities investments this impairment was due to the continuing decline in the creditworthiness of the issuers of these securities and the lack of a market for auction rate securities generally the original cost of the companys auction rate securities investments was 447 million and the estimated remaining fair market value was 107 million at december 31 2008 the company continues to monitor developments in the market for auction rate securities including the specific securities in which it has invested if liquidity conditions relating to these securities or the issuers worsen the company may recognize additional other than temporary impairments which would result in the recognition of additional losses on its condensed consolidated statement of operations 

the companys subsidiaries hold substantially all of its assets and conduct substantially all of its operations and as a result the company relies on distributions or advances from its subsidiaries 

the company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct whollyowned subsidiaries cryovac inc and sealed air corporation us these two subsidiaries directly and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the companys business and conduct operations themselves and through other subsidiaries around the globe therefore the company depends on distributions or advances from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends with respect to shares of its common stock contractual provisions laws or regulations to which the company or any of its subsidiaries may become subject tax inefficiencies and the financial condition and operating requirements of subsidiaries may reduce funds available for service of the companys indebtedness dividends and general corporate purposes

overview 

the company is a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and performancebased materials and equipment systems that serve an array of food industrial medical and consumer applications 

at december 31 2008 the company employed approximately 2600 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market the companys products through a large number of distributors fabricators and converters as well as directly to end users such as food processors food service businesses supermarket retailers and manufacturers the company has no material longterm contracts for the distribution of its products in 2008 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of the companys consolidated net sales although historically net sales of the companys food packaging food solutions and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher in the fourth quarter the company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations or to its reportable business segments 

competition for most of the companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and as a result the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership 

the companys net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation the companys costs can vary with changes in input costs including petrochemicalrelated costs which are not within the companys control consequently the companys management focuses on reducing those costs that the company can control and using petrochemicalbased raw materials as efficiently as possible the company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions 

the companys businesses are managed to generate substantial operating cash flow the company believes that its operating cash flow will permit it to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide the company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises 

the companys consolidated results of operations have been unfavorably impacted by the downturn in global economic conditions that began in the us in late 2007 and spread globally through 2008 the combination of a reduction in customers manufacturing output a decline in retail sales and a rise in customer inventory contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 have negatively affected the companys protective packaging segments unit volume demand globally through early 2009 the company currently anticipates that these conditions will persist globally through at least the first half of 2009

• a decrease in unit volume in latin america of 8 the favorable impacts of product pricemix in latin america and the united states were primarily due to the positive impact of selling price increases implemented in december 2007 and during 2008 for most food packaging products 

the increase in unit volume in the united states was primarily attributed to higher pork slaughter rates during the first half of 2008 which in turn resulted in higher sales of the companys fresh meat packaging products the increase in unit volume in europe was primarily attributed to net positive trends in this region during the first half of 2008 in the fresh red meat and cheese markets which in turn resulted in higher sales of the companys fresh meat and dairy packaging products 

the decrease in unit volume in latin america was primarily due to market factors in brazil throughout 2008 brazilian meat exports to europe were halted due to brazilian meat processors lack of compliance with previously issued european food traceability and safety standards by late 2008 the majority of brazilian meat processors had complied with the standards but by this time endmarket demand in europe had slowed due to a decline in meat consumption attributable to weak economic conditions in europe

the favorable impact of product pricemix in europe was primarily due to improved product pricemix in developing european countries as well as improved product mix of flexible packaging materials in western europe the unfavorable impact of product pricemix in the asiapacific region was primarily due to the impact of lower average selling prices on some of the companys food packaging products in this region 

food solutions segment net sales

2007 compared with 2006

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

the company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements of notes to consolidated financial statements which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k describes these new accounting pronouncements and the companys application of the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 108 and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the companys discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial position and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include the companys officers and other employees outside consultants and legal counsel experts and actuaries in addition the company uses internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of accounts receivable as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to the companys consolidated financial statements 

the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of its consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with the companys significant accounting policies set forth in recent accounting pronouncements of note 2 summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements of notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts —in the normal course of business the company extends credit to its customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria the company maintains an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of the companys customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts which is included in marketing administrative and development expenses on the companys consolidated statements of operations these changes may reflect changes in economic business and market conditions the allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of chargeoffs net of recoveries 

the provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including but not limited to a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances the length of time a receivable is past due and the companys historical experience with its customers in circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known the company records a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount the company reasonably assesses will be collected if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to pay the companys estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount 

commitments and contingencies—litigation —on an ongoing basis the company assesses the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation 

proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses the company considers insurance recoveries if any the company expenses legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred the company has in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or otherwise provided further information on which the company could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability and the company expects to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made 

impairment of longlived assets —the determination of the value of longlived assets requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the companys consolidated financial statements the company periodically reviews longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 

assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses such as future cash flows which are based on operational performance market conditions and other factors and disposition costs may affect the carrying value of longlived assets and result in possible impairment expense in the companys consolidated financial statements as assumptions and estimates change in the future the company may be required to record an impairment charge 

goodwill —in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may potentially be no longer recoverable the company uses a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment the company must recognize an impairment charge for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the company derives an estimate of fair values for each of the companys reporting units using a combination of an income approach and two market approaches each based on an applicable weighting the company assesses the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions the company believes that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting units fair value fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors including projected future operating results anticipated future cash flows comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping and the cost of capital there are inherent uncertainties however related to these factors and to the companys judgment in applying them to this analysis nonetheless the company believes that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of the companys reporting units assumptions for sales earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods 

the income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows the estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debtfree basis the discount rate reflects a marketderived weighted average cost of capital the company believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected longterm operating and cash flow performance the projections are based upon the companys best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates terminal value margin rates future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital 

the company uses two market approaches the first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying ebitda multiples to the reporting units operating performance the ebitda multiples are derived from comparable publiclytraded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit the company believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value 

estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to its reporting units and the company the second market approach is based on the publicly traded common shares of the company and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable ebitda multiples of the company the key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under the two market approaches includes trailing and future 12month ebitda results as applicable under both market approaches a control premium is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100 ownership interest where applicable 

see note 9 goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the companys goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2008 and other related information 

selfinsurance —the company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property casualty workers compensation and employee benefit claims the company accrues for outstanding reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not reported based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for retained losses using historical experience insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values the companys estimates include managements and independent insurance companies assumptions regarding economic conditions the frequency and severity of claims and claim development patterns and settlement practices these estimates and assumptions are monitored and evaluated on a periodic basis by management and are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 

pensions —the company maintains a noncontributory profit sharing plan and a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate for a limited number of its us employees and for some of its international employees the company maintains defined benefit pension plans the company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with sfas no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under this accounting standard the company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed by management on an annual basis the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases the company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits in determining the discount rate the company utilizes market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on the companys asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the economic environment the company believes these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on the companys longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 at december 31 2008 the projected benefit obligation for us pension plans was 539 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2008 was 29 million at december 31 2008 the projected benefit obligation for international pension plans was 2378 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2008 was 141 million 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 158 a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases on the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2008 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2009 in millions 



  



  



  



income taxes —estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets the companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards the company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely the company provides a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

in calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes the company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review the company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect the companys consolidated financial statements 

on january 1 2007 the company adopted the provisions of fin 48 under fin 48 the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 15 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

competition 

competition for most of the companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership there are other companies producing competing products that are well established 

there are other manufacturers of food packaging and food solutions products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate on a global basis and others that operate in a region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic paper metals and other materials the company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which it offers those products ii barrier trays for caseready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which it offers those trays and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the united states

competition in specialty materials is focused on performance characteristics and price competition for most of the companys medical applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics service and price technical design capability is an additional competitive factor for the rigid packaging offered by the medical applications business 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in each of the companys reportable business segments are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films and paper and wood pulp products the company also purchases corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap® cushioning inks 

for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition the company offers a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which it manufactures or has manufactured to its specifications some of which it assembles and some of which it purchases from other suppliers 

the raw materials for the companys products generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several suppliers natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for the companys raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by the companys suppliers some materials used in the companys packaging products are sourced from materials recycled in the companys manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs 

research and development activities 

the company maintains a continuing effort to develop new products and to improve its existing products and processes including developing new packaging and nonpackaging applications for its products from time to time the company also acquires and commercializes new packaging and other products or techniques developed by others the companys research and development projects rely on its technical capabilities in the areas of food science materials science package design and equipment engineering the company spent 908 million for companysponsored research and development in 2007 compared with 782 million during 2006 and 758 million during 2005 

patents and trademarks 

the company is the owner or licensee of a number of united states and foreign patents patent applications trademarks and trademark registrations that relate to many of its products manufacturing processes and equipment the company believes that its patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage none of the companys reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather the company believes that its success depends primarily on its sales and service marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on its ongoing research and development efforts the company believes that the expiration or unenforceability of any of its patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to the companys business or financial position 

environmental matters 

as a manufacturer the company is subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which it operates covering the release of materials into the environment regarding standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment the company reviews environmental laws and regulations pertaining to its operations and believes that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the companys capital expenditures or financial position 

in some jurisdictions in which the companys packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things recycled or reprocessed content and sale or disposal of packaging materials in addition customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that incorporate renewable materials or that are otherwise viewed as being environmentally sound the companys new ventures activities described above emphasize the development of packaging products from renewable resources the company maintains programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations to monitor their evolution and to meet this customer demand these issues can be a competitive advantage for the company given the inherent source reduction benefits of many of its processes and products one advantage inherent in many of the companys products is that thin lightweight packaging solutions reduce customer waste and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives the company continues to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they become available 

the company also supports its customers interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of the companys products or product packaging and for materials used in some of the companys products when possible materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in the companys protective packaging operations or offered to other manufacturers for use in other products in addition recent gains made in internal recycling programs have allowed the company to improve its net raw material yield thus mitigating the impact of rising resin costs while lowering solid waste disposal costs 

employees

raw materials and energy 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as other energyrelated costs may negatively impact the companys results of operations including its profit margins 

the company uses petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of its products during the second half of 2007 petrochemicalbased raw material and other energyrelated costs increased with oil futures setting a record high this negatively impacted the companys profit margins continued increases in market demand for petrochemicalbased raw materials and energy could increase costs for the company 

natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for the companys raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by the companys suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with the companys customers and which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

animal and foodrelated health issues 

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as mad cow disease footandmouth disease and avian influenza or birdflu as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues for the company 

the company manufactures and sells food packaging and food solutions products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging and food solutions products in recent years additional cases of mad cow disease were confirmed and incidents of bird flu have continued to surface in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases such as mad cow or footandmouth disease for example may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for the companys products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these factors may lead to reduced sales of food packaging and food solutions products by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

global operations and economic conditions 

the global nature of the companys operations in the united states and in 50 foreign countries exposes it to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

the company operates in the united states and in 50 other countries and its products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world the company continues to expand its global presence as net sales outside the united states in 2007 were approximately 55 of the companys total net sales additionally the company has over 70 manufacturing facilities and approximately 10200 employees located outside the united states 

as a result of its global operations the company is exposed to economic political business and market conditions in the geographic areas in which it conducts business changes in domestic or foreign laws rules or regulations or governmental or agency actions including those of tax authorities can negatively affect the companys ability to carry on its business governments may impose restrictive or protective importexport requirements as well as other trade measures that may have a negative impact on the company some of the countries in which the companys subsidiaries operate have significantly different approaches to the enforcement of intellectual property contract and other legal rights as a global entity the company may also have greater exposure to the acts and effects of war or terrorism no nonus country had net sales in excess of 10 of consolidated net sales at december 31 2007 

the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company may use financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which use exposes the company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance additionally some of the companys subsidiaries may operate in countries that have highly inflationary economies 

global manufacturing strategy 

the company commenced its global manufacturing strategy in 2006 the costs of the global manufacturing strategy could exceed the benefits if market forces or other factors negatively impact the execution and fulfillment of the strategy 

the companys multiyear global manufacturing strategy includes an expansion of the companys global production capabilities in developing regions as well as a realignment of its existing production into manufacturing centers of excellence the goal of this multiyear program is to expand capacity in growing markets in developing countries further improve the companys operating efficiencies lower its overall cost 

structure and implement new technologies more effectively there are risks inherent in the undertaking of such a program including the stability and sustainability of developing markets shifts in customer preferences competitive forces and technologies cost overruns and unanticipated consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

reliance on subsidiaries 

the companys subsidiaries hold substantially all of its assets and conduct substantially all of its operations and as a result the company relies on distributions or advances from its subsidiaries 

the company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct whollyowned subsidiaries cryovac inc and sealed air corporation us these two subsidiaries directly and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the companys business and conduct operations themselves and through other subsidiaries around the globe therefore the company depends on distributions or advances from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends with respect to shares of its common stock contractual provisions laws or regulations to which the company or any of its subsidiaries may become subject as well its subsidiaries financial condition and operating requirements may reduce funds available for service of its indebtedness dividends and general corporate purposes 

volatility of stock price volume sales and large holdings 

the price of the companys common stock has on occasion experienced significant price and volume fluctuations the sale of substantial amounts of the companys common stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock one stockholder has beneficial ownership of approximately 36 of the companys common shares 

the market price of the companys common stock historically has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations similar to those experienced by the broader stock market in recent years in addition the companys announcements of its quarterly operating results future developments relating to the w r grace bankruptcy additional asbestos or other litigation against the company the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues spikes in raw material and energyrelated costs changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting the company its affiliates or its competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 

the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of the companys common stock in the public market could adversely affect the price of the common stock according to a schedule 13ga filed with the securities and exchange commission or sec dated as of february 12 2008 davis selected advisers lp reported beneficial ownership of 58280212 shares or approximately 36 of the outstanding shares of the companys common stock additionally as of december 31 2007 18 million shares of the companys common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the settlement of the asbestos litigation upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of w r grace 

while the schedule 13ga filed by davis selected advisers indicates that the referenced shares of the companys common stock were not acquired for the purpose of changing or influencing the control of the company if that stockholder were to change its purpose for holding the companys common stock from investment to attempting to change or influence the management of the company this concentration of the companys common stock could potentially affect the company and the price of its common stock

overview 

the company is a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and performancebased materials and equipment systems that serve an array of food industrial medical and consumer applications 

the company employs approximately 2100 sales marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market the companys products through a large number of distributors fabricators and converters as well as directly to end users such as food processors food service businesses and manufacturers the company has no material longterm contracts for the distribution of its products in 2007 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of the companys consolidated net sales although net sales of the companys food packaging food solutions and protective packaging products tend to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher in the fourth quarter the company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations or to its reportable business segments 

competition for most of the companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and as a result the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership 

the companys net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation the companys costs can vary with changes in petrochemicalrelated costs which are not within the companys control consequently the companys management focuses on reducing those costs that the company can control and using petrochemicalbased raw materials as efficiently as possible the company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions 

the companys businesses are managed to generate substantial operating cash flow the company believes that its strong operating cash flow will permit it to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions moreover its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide the company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises 

the companys operating cash flow along with accumulated cash and funds available under its credit facilities should enable the company to make the settlement payment including interest that is expected to be required of the company upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the w r grace  co bankruptcy see asbestos settlement and related costs of note 16 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the companys discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances to derive these estimates and assumptions management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts these sources include the companys officers and other employees outside 

consultants and legal counsel experts and actuaries in addition the company uses internally generated reports and statistics such as aging of accounts receivable as well as outside sources such as government statistics industry reports and thirdparty research studies the results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed and any such differences may be material to the companys consolidated financial statements 

the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of its consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with the companys significant accounting policies set forth in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts —in the normal course of business the company extends credit to its customers if they satisfy predefined credit criteria the company maintains an accounts receivable allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments an additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of the companys customers deteriorates the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that management assesses to be appropriate to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and changes to the allowance are made through the provision for bad debts which is included in marketing administrative and development expenses on the companys consolidated statements of operations these changes may reflect changes in economic business and market conditions the allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts and decreased by the amount of chargeoffs net of recoveries 

the provision for bad debts charged against operating results is based on several factors including but not limited to a regular assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances the length of time a receivable is past due and the companys historical experience with its customers in circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known the company records a specific provision for bad debt against amounts due thereby reducing the receivable to the amount the company reasonably assesses will be collected if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to pay the companys estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount 

commitments and contingencies—litigation —on an ongoing basis the company assesses the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated litigation proceedings are evaluated on a casebycase basis considering the available information including that received from internal and outside legal counsel to assess potential outcomes while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses the company considers insurance recoveries if any the company expenses legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred the company has in the past adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued been settled or otherwise provided further information on which the company could review the likelihood of outflows of resources and their measurability and the company expects to do so in future periods due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made 

impairment of longlived assets —the determination of the value of longlived assets requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the companys consolidated financial statements the company periodically reviews longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangibles is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 

assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses such as future cash flows which are based on operational performance market conditions and other factors and disposition costs may affect the carrying value of longlived assets and possible impairment expense in the companys consolidated financial statements if assumptions and estimates change in the future the company may be required to record an impairment charge 

selfinsurance —the company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property casualty workers compensation and employee benefit claims the company accrues for outstanding reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not reported based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for retained losses using historical experience insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values the companys estimates include managements and independent insurance companies assumptions regarding economic conditions the frequency and severity of claims and claim development patterns and settlement practices these estimates and assumptions are monitored and evaluated on a periodic basis by management and are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 

pensions —the company maintains a noncontributory profit sharing plan and a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate for a limited number of its us employees and for some of its international employees the company maintains defined benefit pension plans the company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with sfas no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under this accounting standard the company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 

the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on thirdparty actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed by management on an annual basis the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases the company revises these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of longterm trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits in determining the discount rate the company utilizes market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weightedaverage expected return on the companys asset allocation asset return data historical return data and the current economic environment the company believes these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the rate of compensation increase is based on the companys longterm plans for such increases the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is december 31 at december 31 2007 the projected benefit obligation for us pension plans was 445 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2007 was 29 million at december 31 2007 the projected benefit obligation for international pension plans was 3066 million and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2007 was 121 million 

in general material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 158 a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases decreases on the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2007 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december 31 2008 in millions 



 

 

 

income taxes —estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets the companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards the company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely the company provides a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

in calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes the company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review the company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law if the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the reserves are no longer necessary if an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to income tax provision would result these adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect the companys consolidated financial statements 

on january 1 2007 the company adopted the provisions of fin 48 under fin 48 the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities see note 15 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

nongaap information

the carrying value of the companys total debt which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps was 18718 million at december 31 2007 and 18523 million at december 31 2006 the companys fixed rate debt including the impact of interest rate swaps was 15261 million at december 31 2007 and 15314 million at december 31 2006 the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the estimated fair value of the companys total debt including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps was 18184 million at december 31 2007 compared with 18859 million at december 31 2006 a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of 770 million in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2007 these changes in the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt do not alter the companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2007 would have caused the company to pay approximately 201 million to terminate these contracts 

the companys foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 12 derivatives and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements which is contained in part ii item 8 and in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—derivative financial instruments—foreign currency forward contracts contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2007 and 2006 the company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 

the companys outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 492 million at december 31 2007 and 344 million at december 31 2006 

investments 

the companys availableforsale investments are exposed to market risk related to changes in conditions in the us financial markets as a result of liquidity conditions affecting capital markets particularly in the us specifically for assetbacked securities every auction for the auction rate securities held by the company over the last several months of 2007 failed the company believes that this is indicative of the severe pressure from the subprime lending collapse that began in 2007 rather than specific concerns with respect to the issuers of the auction rate securities or the securities themselves the companys availableforsale investments are described in note 5 availableforsale investments of notes to consolidated financial statements 

commodities 

the company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes generally the company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover the companys supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories the company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

competition 

competition for most of the company’s packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership there are other companies producing competing products that are well established 

there are other manufacturers of food packaging products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate on a global basis and others that operate in a region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic paper metals and other materials in rigid packaging the company is generally one of many suppliers in the geographic areas in which it operates the company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which it offers those products ii solid plastic trays for case ready meat products in the united states and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the united states

the raw materials for the company’s products generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several suppliers natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for the company’s raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by the company’s suppliers some materials used in the company’s protective packaging products are sourced 

from materials recycled in the company’s manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs 

research and development activities 

the company maintains a continuing effort to develop new products and to improve its existing products and processes including developing new packaging and nonpackaging applications for its products from time to time the company also acquires and commercializes new packaging designs or techniques developed by others the company has joint research and development projects combining the technical capabilities of its food packaging operations and its protective packaging operations the company spent 782 million for companysponsored research and development in 2006 compared with 758 million during 2005 and 732 million during 2004 

patents and trademarks 

the company is the owner or licensee of a number of united states and foreign patents patent applications trademarks and trademark registrations that relate to many of its products manufacturing processes and equipment the company believes that its patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage neither of the company’s reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather the company believes that its success depends primarily on its marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on its ongoing research and development efforts the company believes that the expiration or unenforceability of any of its patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to the company’s business or financial position 

environmental matters 

as a manufacturer the company is subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which it operates covering the release of materials into the environment regarding standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment in 2006 the european parliament approved a major expansion of the european union’s chemical regulations the legislation is known as reach or registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach which becomes effective in june 2007 is expected to have a widespread impact on industries and products worldwide through trade in and with the european union the company is working with its suppliers to manage the impact of reach on its operations and to insure compliance with its provisions the company reviews environmental laws and regulations pertaining to its operations and believes that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the company’s capital expenditures or financial position 

in some jurisdictions in which the company’s packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things recycled or reprocessed content and sale or disposal of packaging materials in addition customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that are viewed as being “environmentally sound” or that minimize the generation of solid waste the company maintains programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations to monitor their evolution and to meet this customer demand these issues can be a competitive advantage for the company given the inherent source reduction benefits of many of its processes and products one advantage inherent in many of the company’s products is that thin lightweight packaging solutions reduce customer waste and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives the company continues to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they become available 

the company also supports its customers’ interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of the company’s products or product packaging and for materials used in some of the company’s products when possible materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in the company’s protective packaging operations or offered to other 

manufacturers for use in other products in addition recent gains made in internal recycling programs have allowed the company to improve its net raw material yield thus mitigating the impact of rising resin costs while lowering solid waste disposal costs 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 the company had approximately 17400 employees worldwide approximately 7300 of those employees were in the us with approximately 600 of those covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 10100 company employees who were outside the us approximately 6000 were covered by collective bargaining agreements outside of the us many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed the company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory

raw materials and energy 

raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as other energyrelated costs may negatively impact the company’s results of operations including its profit margins 

the company uses petrochemicalbased raw materials to manufacture many of its food and protective packaging products during most of 2006 petrochemicalbased raw material and other energyrelated costs increased with oil futures setting a record high this negatively impacted the company’s profit margins continued increases in market demand for petrochemicalbased raw materials and energy could increase costs for the company natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future these factors could lead to increased prices for the company’s raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by the company’s suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with the company’s customers and which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

animal and foodrelated health issues 

the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as “mad cow” disease footandmouth disease and avian influenza or “birdflu” as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues for the company 

the company manufactures and sells food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products during 2006 additional cases of mad cow disease were confirmed and incidents of bird flu have continued to surface in various countries outbreaks of animal diseases such as mad cow or footandmouth disease for example may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for the company’s products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these restrictions and changes may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

global operations

introduction 

the company manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products operating in the united states and in 50 other countries with products distributed in those countries and in other parts of the world 

the company operates in two reportable business segments food packaging and protective packaging the company’s principal food packaging products are flexible materials associated packaging equipment systems rigid containers and absorbent pads these products many of which bear the cryovac trademark package a broad range of perishable foods the company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors distributors supermarket retailers and food service businesses 

the company’s principal protective packaging products provide cushioning surface protection and void fill the company primarily sells its protective packaging products and systems to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries the products in this segment enable end users to provide a high degree of protection in packaging their items they also aid product display and merchandising 

the company’s global sales and marketing staff numbered approximately 2500 employees in the countries in which it operates who sell and market the company’s products through a large number of distributors fabricators and converters as well as directly to end users such as food processors food service businesses and manufacturers the company has no material longterm contracts for the distribution of its products in 2006 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of the company’s consolidated net sales although net sales of both food packaging products and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter the company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business or to either reportable business segment 

competition for most of the company’s packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and as a result the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership 

the company’s net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers’ business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation its costs can vary with changes in petrochemicalrelated costs which are not within the company’s control consequently the company’s management focuses on reducing those costs that the company can control and using petrochemicalbased raw materials as efficiently as possible the company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions that may more strongly affect some of its competitors 

as is discussed below the company’s businesses are managed to generate substantial cash flow the company believes that its strong cash flow will permit it to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of acquisitions and capital expenditures for property and equipment moreover its ability to generate substantial cash flow should provide the company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises this cash flow along with accumulated cash and funds available under its credit facilities should enable the company to make the 

settlement payment including interest that is expected to be required of the company upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the w r grace  co bankruptcy as discussed below 

in addition to investing in its business the company uses its cash flow to reduce debt and to return value to its shareholders on january 30 2006 the company announced that it was initiating payment of a quarterly cash dividend the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 015 per common share that was payable on march 17 june 16 september 15 and december 15 2006 on february 16 2007 the company announced that its board of directors had declared a twoforone stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend payable on march 16 2007 to stockholders of record of outstanding shares of its common stock at the close of business on march 2 2007 the company’s board of directors also increased the company’s quarterly cash dividend by 33 to 020 per common share declaring a quarterly cash dividend payable on the presplit shares of the company’s common stock on march 16 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 2 2007 in addition  on july 19 2006 the company’s 5625 euro notes with a face value of € 2000 million matured the company used available cash of 2517 million to retire this debt

highlights for the company’s year 2006 compared with 2005 and 2004 were 

 

  

net sales 

the principal factors contributing to changes in net sales in the three years ended december 31 2006 were changes in unit volume changes in product mix and increases in average selling prices in addition the 2006 period had increased volumes from acquired businesses the 2005 period was impacted by the effects of foreign currency translation while the impact in 2006 was minimal 

net sales in 2006 increased 6 to 43279 million compared with 40851 million in 2005 the components of the increase in net sales for 2006 were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

in 2006 foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on net sales during the first six months of 2006 net sales had an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation primarily from the weakness of foreign currencies in europe which were offset in the second half of 2006 by their strengthening against the us dollar in addition the brazilian real and the canadian dollar strengthened all year against the us dollar offset by the weakness of foreign currencies in asia pacific 

net sales for 2005 increased 8 to 40851 million compared with 37981 million in 2004 the components of the increase in net sales for 2005 were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of 573 million in 2005 excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation net sales would have increased 6 compared with 2004 the favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales for the full year of 2005 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in the asia pacific region brazil and europe against the us dollar the full year favorable impact of 573 million includes an unfavorable fourth quarter impact of 109 million primarily due to the weakness of foreign currencies in europe against the us dollar 

net sales of the company’s food packaging segment which consists primarily of the company’s cryovac® food packaging products constituted 62 of net sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 the company’s protective packaging segment contributed the balance of net sales this segment aggregates the company’s protective packaging products and shrink packaging products all of which are used principally for nonfood packaging applications 

food packaging segment sales

during 2006 strong unit volume growth primarily in latin america the positive impact of the company’s 2006 acquisitions and selling price increases in north america added to sales growth during the year in 2005 unit volumes increased in all regions of the world with the asia pacific and latin america regions having the primary impact the segment also benefited in 2005 from pricemix due in part to selling price increases

foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 373 million in 2005 for flexible packaging materials and related systems excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect net sales for flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 6 compared with 2004

foreign currency translation had a minimal unfavorable impact of 06 million in 2006 for rigid packaging and absorbent pads excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation the increase in net sales in 2006 would have remained the same at 11 compared with 2005 foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 51 million in 2005 for rigid packaging and absorbent pads excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 9 compared with 2004

foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 10 million in 2006 for this segmentwhich would not have changed the net sales growth compared with 2005 in 2005 foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 15 million for this segment excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect net sales in 2005 for the protective packaging segment would have increased 6 compared with 2004

costs and margins 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 287 in 2006 283 in 2005 and 306 in 2004 the increase in gross profit in 2006 was due to the positive impact of selling price increases combined with improved operating efficiencies that helped offset higher average petrochemicalbased raw material and other energyrelated costs compared with the prior year during the first three quarters of 2006 petrochemicalbased raw material and other energyrelated costs were higher than in the corresponding 2005 quarter during the fourth quarter of 2006 certain petrochemicalbased commodity raw material prices moderated but most speciality resin costs were at or above 2005 levels 

the principal cause for the reduction in 2005 compared with 2004 was significantly higher petrochemicalbased raw material and other energyrelated costs over this time frame the prices of crude oil and natural gas which serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of many of the resins the company buys increased significantly although changes in prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks they are indicative of the variations in raw material and energyrelated costs faced by the company in addition the decrease in gross profit was also caused in part by an unfavorable shift in product mix which was partially offset by increases in selling prices 

marketing administrative and development expenses increased 9 in 2006 and 3 in 2005 the increase in 2006 was due to higher yearonyear management incentive compensation of approximately 110 million as the company met most of its performance objectives in 2006 incremental spending related to the upgrade of the company’s information technology platform of approximately 100 million operating expenses of businesses acquired during the year including nelipak holdings bv in january 2006 and biosphere industries llc in october 2006 of approximately 120 million in the aggregate and expenses to support the higher volume in net sales 

the increase in 2005 was due to the impact of foreign currency translation higher professional fees and to a lesser extent expenses for research and development related projects partially offset by a reduction in management incentive compensation as the company did not meet certain performance objectives for 2005 and partial year savings from restructuring activities initiated in the fourth quarter of 2004 as discussed below 

marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 162 in 2006 158 in 2005 and 165 in 2004

the increase in 2005 was due to an increase in net sales and a decrease of 313 million in restructuring and other charges partially offset by higher petrochemicalbased raw material and other energyrelated costs and an increase of 198 million in marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales operating profit was 122 in 2006 125 in 2005 and 132 in 2004

the decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to higher raw material and energyrelated costs combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix partially offset by selling price increases 

protective packaging operating profit

·   a decrease of 18 million related to higher capitalized interest during the construction of capital investment projects in 2006 compared with the 2005 period

·   an increase of 17 million caused by additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the asbestos settlement agreement

the decrease in interest expense in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the following 

·   a 125 million decrease due to the redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount 1775 million of the company’s 875 senior notes due july 2008 the repurchase of 227 million face amount of its 695 senior notes due may 2009 and the termination of related interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 150 million all in the fourth quarter of 2004

the company’s effective income tax rate was 315 in 2006 321 in 2005 and 333 in 2004 the decrease in the 2006 effective income tax rate compared with 2005 was primarily due to a shift in the mix of foreign earnings the company currently expects an effective income tax rate of approximately 315 for 2007 

the decrease in the 2005 effective income tax rate compared with 2004 was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for tax matters for periods that closed in the relevant jurisdictions 

in 2006 and 2005 the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of 350 primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings partially offset by the effect of state income taxes

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america known as us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed may differ from estimates and while any differences may be material to the company’s consolidated financial statements the company does not believe that the differences taken as a whole will be material 

the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

accounts receivable—in the normal course of business the company extends credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria accounts receivable as shown on the consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the company’s customers deteriorates 

commitments and contingencies—litigation—on an ongoing basis the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses the company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made the company expenses legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred 

impairment of longlived assets—the company periodically reviews longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year a review of goodwill 

may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses such as future cash flows and disposition costs may affect the carrying value of longlived assets and possible impairment expense in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

selfinsurance—the company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property casualty workers’ compensation and employee benefit claims the company accrues for outstanding reported claims claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon management’s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 

pensions— the company maintains a noncontributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate for a limited number of its us employees and for some of its nonus employees the company maintains defined benefit pension plans the company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” under this accounting standard the company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations the expected future rate of return on plan assets the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions the measurement date used to determine the benefit obligations and the plan assets is december 31 in general changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 158 

income taxes—the company’s deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards the company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely the company provides a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could materially impact the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes the company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review the company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law 

educational donation 

during the second quarter of 2006 the company donated 15 million to the harvard business school in partial funding of a professorship in the name of t j dermot dunphy mr dunphy a director of the company was chief executive officer of the company from march 1971 until his retirement in february 2000 he received a master’s degree in business administration from the school in 1956 

nongaap information 

the company’s management from time to time presents information that does not conform to us generally accepted accounting principles including changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation the company’s management uses changes in net sales excluding the effects of foreign currency translation to measure the performance of the company’s operations thus management believes that this information may be useful to investors such measures are also among the criteria upon which performancebased compensation may be determined 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company does not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time the company may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

the company’s interest rate swaps are described in note 11 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements which is contained in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—derivative financial instruments—interest rate swaps” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 the company had no collars or options outstanding 

at december 31 2006 and 2005 the carrying value of the company’s total debt which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps was 18523 million and 20762 million respectively the company’s fixed rate debt at december 31 2006 and 2005 including the impact of interest rate swaps was 15314 million and 17677 million respectively the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the estimated fair value of the company’s total debt including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps was 18859 million at december 31 2006 compared with 21357 million at december 31 2005 a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2006 of 816 million these changes in the fair value of the company’s fixed rate debt do not alter the company’s obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2006 would have caused the company to pay approximately 207 million to terminate these contracts 

the company’s foreign currency forward contracts are described in note 11 “derivatives and hedging activities” of the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements which is contained in part ii item 8 and in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—derivative financial instruments—foreign currency forward contracts” contained in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2006 and 2005 the company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 

the company’s outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 344 million and 2628 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in 2006 compared with 2005 was due to the maturity of the company’s 5625 euro notes with a face value of € 2000 million as discussed above

commodities 

the company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes generally the company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover the company’s supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories the company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

although net sales of both food packaging products and protective packaging products tend to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter the company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business or to either reportable business segment 

competition 

competition for most of the companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price since competition is also based upon innovations in 

packaging technology the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership there are other companies producing competing products that are well established and may have greater financial resources than the company 

there are other manufacturers of food packaging products some of which are companies offering similar products that operate on a global basis and others that operate in a region or single country competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic paper metals and other materials in rigid packaging the company is generally one of many suppliers in the geographic areas in which it operates the company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of i flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which it offers those products ii solid plastic trays for case ready meat products in the united states and iii absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the united states 

the companys protective packaging products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products expanded plastics corrugated die cuts loose fill packaging materials strapping envelopes reinforced bags boxes and other containers and various corrugated materials the companys instapak® packaging and its plank and laminated foam products also compete with various types of molded foam plastics fabricated foam plastics mechanical shock mounts and wood blocking and bracing systems the company believes that it is one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer inflatable packaging shrink films for industrial and commercial applications protective mailers polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which it sells these products 

raw materials 

the principal raw materials used in both of the companys reportable business segments are polyolefin and other petrochemicalbased resins and films and paper and wood pulp products the company also purchases corrugated materials cores for rolls of products such as films and bubble wrap® cushioning inks for printed materials and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products in addition the company offers a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment some of which it manufactures or has manufactured to its specifications some of which it assembles and some of which it purchases from other suppliers 

the raw materials for the companys products generally have been readily available on the open market and in most cases are available from several suppliers during 2005 hurricanes katrina and rita temporarily adversely affected the production and delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers with operations along the gulf coast of the united states this led to a general curtailment of petrochemicalbased raw materials supplies from that area however due to the efforts of the companys supply chain team the company was able to operate without interruption some materials used in the companys protective packaging products are sourced from materials recycled in the companys manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs 

product development 

the company maintains a continuing effort to develop new products and to improve its existing products and processes including developing new packaging and nonpackaging applications for its products from time to time the company also acquires and commercializes new packaging designs or techniques developed by others the company has joint research and development projects combining the technical capabilities of its food packaging operations and its protective packaging operations the company spent 758 million for companysponsored research and development in 2005 compared with 732 million during 2004 and 690 million during 2003 

patents and trademarks 

the company is the owner or licensee of a number of united states and foreign patents patent applications trademarks and trademark registrations that relate to many of its products manufacturing processes and equipment the company believes that its patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage neither of the companys reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone rather the company believes that its success depends primarily on its marketing engineering and manufacturing skills and on its ongoing research and development efforts the company believes that the expiration or unenforceability of any of its patents applications licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to the companys business or financial position 

environmental matters 

as a manufacturer the company is subject to various laws rules and regulations in the countries jurisdictions and localities in which it operates covering the release of materials into the environment regarding standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment the company reviews environmental laws and regulations pertaining to its operations and believes that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the companys capital expenditures or financial position 

in some jurisdictions in which the companys packaging products are sold or used laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate among other things recycled or reprocessed content and sale or disposal of packaging materials in addition customer demand continues to evolve for packaging materials that are viewed as being environmentally sound or that minimize the generation of solid waste the company maintains programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations to monitor their evolution and to meet this customer demand these issues can be a competitive advantage for the company given the inherent source reduction benefits of many of its processes and products one advantage inherent in many of the companys products is that thin lightweight packaging solutions reduce customer waste and transportation costs in comparison to available alternatives the company continues to evaluate and implement new technologies in this area as they become available 

the company also supports its customers interests in eliminating waste by offering or participating in collection programs for some of the companys products or product packaging and for materials used in some of the companys products when possible materials collected through these programs are reprocessed and either reused in the companys protective packaging operations or offered to other manufacturers for use in other products in addition recent gains made in internal recycling programs have allowed the company to improve its net raw material yield thus mitigating the impact of rising resin costs while lowering solid waste disposal costs 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 the company had approximately 17000 employees worldwide approximately 7500 of those employees were in the us with approximately 500 of those covered by collective bargaining agreements of the approximately 9500 company employees who were outside the us approximately 6900 were covered by collective bargaining agreements outside of the us many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed the company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory

significantly different from its obligations under the settlement agreement the company cannot estimate at this time what those differences or their magnitude may be in the event these liabilities are materially larger than the current existing obligations they could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations although grace filed a proposed plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court in january 2005 the company cannot predict when a final plan of reorganization will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement

for further information concerning these matters see note 16 commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements which is contained in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k under asbestos settlement and related costs cryovac transaction and contingencies related to the cryovac transaction 

raw materials and energy 

  raw material pricing availability and allocation by suppliers as well as other energyrelated costs may negatively impact the companys results of operations including its profit margins 

during 2005 petrochemicalbased raw material and other energyrelated costs escalated as a result of strong market demand exacerbated by the hurricanes in the gulf coast of the united states this negatively impacted the companys profit margins natural disasters such as hurricanes as well as political instability and terrorist activities may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers in the future that could lead to increased prices for the companys raw materials curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by the companys suppliers which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with its customers and which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

animal and foodrelated health issues 

  the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy also known as mad cow disease footandmouth disease and avian influenza or birdflu as well as other health issues affecting the food industry may lead to decreased revenues for the company 

the company manufactures and sells food packaging products among other products various health issues affecting the food industry have in the past and may in the future have a negative effect on the sales of food packaging products outbreaks of animal diseases such as mad cow or footandmouth disease for example may lead governments to restrict exports and imports of potentially affected animals and food products leading to decreased demand for the companys products and possibly also to the culling or slaughter of significant numbers of the animal population otherwise intended for food supply also consumers may change their eating habits as a result of perceived problems with certain types of food these restrictions and changes may lead to reduced sales of food packaging products by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

global operations 

  the global nature of the companys operations in the united states and in fifty foreign countries exposes it to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

the company operates in the united states and in 50 other countries and its products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world the company continues to expand its global presence as net sales outside the united states in 2005 made up approximately 52 of the companys total net sales additionally the company has 75 manufacturing facilities and approximately 9500 employees located outside the united states 

as a result of its global operations the company is exposed to economic political business and market conditions in the geographic areas in which it conducts business changes in domestic or foreign laws rules or regulations or governmental or agency actions can negatively affect the companys ability to carry on its business governments may impose restrictive or protective importexport requirements as well as other trade measures that may have a negative impact on the company some of the countries in which the companys subsidiaries operate have significantly different laws on the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights as a global entity the company may also have greater exposure to the acts and effects of war or terrorism 

the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the company may use financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which use exposes the company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance additionally some of the companys subsidiaries may operate in countries that have highly inflationary economies 

global manufacturing strategy 

  the company will begin the first phase of a new global manufacturing strategy while too soon to reasonably estimate the costs of the global manufacturing strategy could exceed the benefits if market forces or other outside influences negatively impact the execution and fulfillment of the strategy 

the company has announced that it will begin the first phase of a new global manufacturing strategy this strategy would include an expansion of the companys global production capabilities in developing markets around the world as well as a realignment of its existing production into manufacturing centers of excellence the goal of this multiyear program is to further improve the companys operating efficiencies lower its overall cost structure and implement new technologies more 

effectively there are risks inherent in the undertaking of such a program including the stability and sustainability of developing markets shifts in customer preferences competitive forces and technologies cost overruns and unanticipated consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

reliance on subsidiaries 

  the companys subsidiaries hold substantially all of its assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of its operations and as a result the company relies on distributions or advances from its subsidiaries 

the company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct whollyowned subsidiaries cryovac inc and sealed air corporation us these two subsidiaries directly and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the companys business and conduct operations themselves and through other subsidiaries around the globe therefore the company depends on distributions or advances from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends with respect to shares of its common stock contractual provisions laws or regulations to which the company or any of its subsidiaries may become subject as well its subsidiaries financial condition and operating requirements may reduce funds available for service of its indebtedness dividends and general corporate purposes 

volatility of stock price volume sales and large holdings 

  the price of the companys common stock historically has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations which may make it difficult for investors to resell the common stock and the sale of substantial amounts of the companys common stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock one shareholder has been identified as having sole voting and dispositive power with respect to 29196437 shares or approximately 3587 of the companys common stock and another shareholder has been identified as having sole dispositive power with respect to 8902500 shares or approximately 109 of the companys common stock 

the market price of the companys common stock historically has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations similar to those experienced by the broader stock market in recent years in addition the companys announcements of its quarterly operating results future developments relating to the w r grace bankruptcy additional asbestos or other litigation against the company the effects of animal and foodrelated health issues spikes in raw material and energyrelated costs changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting the company its affiliates or its competitors could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 

in addition the sale of substantial amounts of the companys common stock could adversely affect its price according to a schedule 13ga filed with the securities and exchange commission or sec dated as of december 31 2005 davis selected advisers lp reported sole voting and investment power with respect to 29196437 shares or approximately 3587 of the outstanding shares of the companys common stock and according to a schedule 13ga filed with the sec dated as of february 6 2006 capital research and management company reported sole dispositive power with respect to 8902500 shares or approximately 109 of the companys outstanding common stock in addition as of december 31 2005 2403903 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the companys contingent stock plan and directors stock plan and options to purchase 89761 shares of the common stock were outstanding all of which options were exercisable issuance of such reserved shares would cause dilution of stock holdings moreover as of december 31 2005 nine million shares of the companys common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the settlement of the asbestos litigation upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of w r grace the sale 

or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of the companys common stock in the public market could adversely affect the price of the common stock 

while the schedules 13ga filed by davis selected advisers and capital research and management indicate that the referenced shares of the companys common stock were not acquired for the purpose of changing or influencing the control of the company if either stockholder were to change its purpose of holding the companys common stock from investment to attempting to influence the management of the company these concentrations of the companys common stock could potentially negatively impact the company and the price of its common stock

introduction 

the company manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products operating in the united states and in 50 other countries with products distributed in those countries and in other parts of the world 

the company operates in two reportable business segments food packaging and protective packaging the companys principal food packaging products are flexible materials associated packaging equipment systems rigid containers and absorbent pads these products many of which bear the cryovac trademark package a broad range of perishable foods the company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors distributors supermarket retailers and food service businesses 

the companys principal protective packaging products provide cushioning surface protection and void fill the company primarily sells its protective packaging products and systems to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries 

the companys global sales and marketing staff numbered approximately 2600 employees in the countries in which it operates who sell and market the companys products through a large number of distributors fabricators and converters as well as directly to end users such as food processors food service businesses and manufacturers the company has no material longterm contracts for the distribution of its products in 2005 no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10 or more of the companys consolidated net sales although net sales of both food packaging products and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter the company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business or to either reportable business segment 

competition for most of the companys packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics service and price competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and as a result the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership 

the companys net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions changes in the global economy and the effects of foreign currency translation its costs can vary significantly with changes in petrochemicalrelated costs which are not within the companys control consequently the companys management focuses on reducing those costs that the company can control and using petrochemicalbased raw materials as efficiently as possible the company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions that may more strongly affect some of its competitors 

as is discussed below the companys businesses are managed to generate substantial cash flow the company believes that its strong cash flow will permit it to continue to spend significantly on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of acquisitions and capital expenditures for property and equipment moreover its ability to generate substantial cash flow should provide the company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises the company also believes that this cash flow along with accumulated cash and funds available under its credit facilities will enable the company to make the settlement payment including interest that is expected to be required of the company upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the 

w r grace  co bankruptcy as discussed below in addition to investing in its business the company uses its cash flow to reduce debt and to return value to its shareholders on january 30 2006 the company announced that it is initiating payment of a quarterly cash dividend the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 015 per common share payable on march 17 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 3 2006 

highlights for the companys year 2005 compared with 2004 and 2003 were 

 net sales 

the principal factors contributing to changes in net sales in the three years ended december 31 2005 were changes in unit volume changes in product mix and average selling prices and foreign currency translation 

net sales in 2005 increased 8 to 40851 million compared with 37981 million in 2004 the components of the increase in net sales for 2005 were as follows dollars in millions 

 21 

net sales for 2004 increased 8 to 37981 million compared with 35319 million in 2003 the components of the increase in net sales for 2004 were as follows dollars in millions 

 foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of 573 million in 2005 excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation net sales would have increased 6 compared with 2004 the favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales for the full year of 2005 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in the asia pacific region brazil and europe against the us dollar the full year favorable impact of 573 million includes an unfavorable fourth quarter impact of 109 million primarily due to the weakness of foreign currencies in europe against the us dollar 

foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on net sales of 1594 million in 2004 excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation net sales would have increased 3 compared with 2003 the favorable foreign currency translation impact on net sales in 2004 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in europe and the asia pacific region against the us dollar partially offset by the weakness of the brazilian real 

net sales of the companys food packaging segment which consists primarily of the companys cryovac® food packaging products constituted 62 of net sales in 2005 and 2004 and 63 of net sales in 2003 the companys protective packaging segment contributed the balance of net sales this segment aggregates the companys protective packaging products and shrink packaging products all of which are used principally for nonfood packaging applications

in 2005 unit volumes increased in all regions of the world with the asia pacific and latin america regions having the primary impact the segment also benefited from pricemix due in part to selling price increases in 2004 unit volumes increased in latin america and to a lesser extent in asia pacific and europe partially offset by a decrease in north america the decrease in north america was due to import restrictions imposed by several countries on us beef products which adversely affected the sales of food packaging products to the companys customers that process us beef for export 

among the classes of products in the food packaging segment net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems increased 7 to 21228 million in 2005 compared with 19765 million in 2004 and increased 6 in 2004 compared with 2003 net sales of 1868 million foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 373 million in 2005 for flexible packaging materials and related systems excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect net sales for flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 6 in 2005 foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 905 million in 2004 for flexible packaging materials and related systems excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect net sales for flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 1 in 2004 the components of the increase in net sales for 2005 and 2004 were as follows dollars in millions

foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 15 million in 2005 for this segment excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect net sales for the protective packaging segment would have increased 6 in 2005 foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 496 million in 2004 for this segment excluding the positive foreign currency translation effect net sales for the protective packaging segment would have increased 7 in 2004

sales by geographic region 

net sales from operations in the united states represented 48 and 49 of net sales in 2005 and 2004 respectively net sales from us operations increased 7 in 2005 to 19729 million compared with 18518 million in 2004 net sales from international operations increased 9 in 2005 to 21122 million compared with 19463 million in 2004 excluding the 573 million positive foreign currency translation effect international net sales would have increased 6 compared with 2004 the components of the increase in net sales by geographic region for 2005 were as follows dollars in millions

costs and margins 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 283 in 2005 306 in 2004 and 315 in 2003 the principal cause for the reduction since 2003 was significantly higher petrochemicalbased raw materials and other energyrelated costs between 2003 and 2005 the prices of crude oil and natural gas which serve as feedstocks utilized in the production of many of the resins the company buys have approximately doubled although changes in prices of crude oil and natural gas are not perfect benchmarks they are indicative of the variations in raw material and energyrelated costs faced by the company the decrease in gross profit in 2005 compared with 2004 was also caused in part by an 

unfavorable shift in product mix which was partially offset by increases in selling prices the decrease in 2004 compared with 2003 was also due to a reduction in sales volumes in the north america food packaging business due to import restrictions on us beef products imposed by certain foreign governments 

marketing administrative and development expenses increased 3 in 2005 and 9 in 2004 the increase in 2005 was due to the impact of foreign currency translation higher professional fees and to a lesser extent expenses for research and development related projects partially offset by a reduction in management incentive compensation since the company did not meet earnings growth objectives for 2005 and partial year savings from restructuring activities initiated in the fourth quarter of 2004 as discussed below the increase in 2004 was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency translation expenses associated with the upgrade of the companys information technology platform and expenses to support the higher volume of net sales marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 158 in 2005 165 in 2004 and 162 in 2003 

2004 restructuring program 

during the fourth quarter of 2004 the company announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic regions in order to complement the companys longterm growth programs and financial goals improve the companys operating efficiencies and lower its overall cost structure the plans principally reduced the number of employees and consolidated or relocated operations in both of the companys reportable business segments 

at december 31 2004 the company expected to eliminate 473 fulltime positions and during 2005 the company revised the number of positions to be eliminated to 475 during 2004 65 positions were eliminated and 379 positions were eliminated during 2005 for a total of 444 positions eliminated by the end of 2005 as an element of the program the company expects to add approximately 100 positions in connection with the companys realignment or relocation of some of its manufacturing activities so that the net reduction in positions is expected to be approximately 375 these actions affected principally production workers and members of the companys sales force primarily in europe the company expects to substantially complete this reduction in headcount by march 2006 

the charges for the year ended december 31 2004 consisted of the following 



the longlived asset impairment of 103 million consisted of writedowns and writeoffs of property and equipment the impairments related to decisions to rationalize and realign production of some of the companys smaller product lines and to close several smaller european manufacturing facilities since the undiscounted cash flows associated with these asset groups including estimated salvage value were less than the carrying values of these asset groups they were written down to their estimated fair value the company plans to dispose of these facilities and much of the equipment during the first six months of 2006 

the components of the restructuring charges spending and other activity through december 31 2005 and the remaining accrual balance at december 31 2005 were as follows 



the company expects to pay 50 million of the remaining accrual balance at december 31 2005 in 2006 and 04 million in 2007 and thereafter 

for the year ended december 31 2005 the company recorded 17 million of additional charges related to the 2004 restructuring program this amount includes 13 million of costs incurred in 2005 related to the relocation of assets and employees from facilities that were closed as part of the restructuring program the company also recorded a net charge of 04 million related to the employee termination costs that were accrued as part of the 2004 restructuring program the modifications to the originally recorded amounts were due to increases in the amounts due to terminated employees 09 million and reductions based upon certain employees no longer being eligible for the termination benefits 05 million 

the company estimates that the cost savings realized in 2005 were 18 to 20 million and estimates that it will realize approximately 25 to 30 million in annualized cost savings on a full year run rate basis by the end of 2006 

operating profit 

operating profit increased 15 in 2005 and decreased 70 in 2004 the increase in 2005 was due to an increase in net sales and a decrease of 313 million in restructuring and other charges partially offset by higher petrochemicalbased raw materials and other energyrelated costs and an increase of 198 million in marketing administrative and development expenses the decrease in operating profit in 2004 was due to 33 million of restructuring and other charges 537 million of higher marketing administrative and development expenses an increase in petrochemicalrelated raw material costs and reduced sales volumes in the companys north american food packaging business offset by an increase in total net sales all of which are discussed above as a percentage of net sales operating profit was 125 in 2005 132 in 2004 and 153 in 2003 

operating profit by business segment for 2005 2004 and 2003 was as follows dollars in millions

protective packaging operating profit was 122 150 and 146 of protective packaging net sales in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the decline in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2005 compared with 2004 was due to higher raw material and energyrelated costs combined with an unfavorable shift in product mix partially offset by selling price increases the increase in operating profit as a percentage of net sales in 2004 compared with 2003 was due to higher unit volumes benefits from ongoing productivity initiatives and price increases implemented to help offset rising raw material costs partially offset by higher raw material costs 

interest expense and other income net 

interest expense which includes the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs bond discount and terminated treasury locks was 1497 million in 2005 1537 million in 2004 and 136 million in 2003 

the decrease in interest expense in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the following 

• a 125 million decrease due to the redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount 1775 million of the companys 875 senior notes due july 2008 the repurchase of 227 million face amount of its 695 senior notes due may 2009 and the termination of related interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 150 million all in the fourth quarter of 2004 partially offset by 

• an increase of 47 million due to the impact of higher interest rates on the companys 300 million of outstanding interest rate swaps entered into to effectively convert its 5375 senior notes due april 2008 into floating rate debt • an increase of 16 million caused by additional expense related to the compounding of interest on the amount payable pursuant to the asbestos settlement agreement and • an increase of 14 million related to lower capitalized interest during the construction of capital investment projects in 2005 compared with the 2004 period the increase in interest expense in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to the following 

• an increase of 372 million of interest expense in 2004 due to the companys issuance of approximately 300 million of senior notes in april 2003 and 13 billion of senior notes and convertible senior notes in july 2003 as discussed below partially offset by 

• a decrease of 164 million of interest expense due to the repurchase of 1725 million face amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the senior note redemption and repurchases completed in the fourth quarter of 2004 other income net was 159 million in 2005 58 million in 2004 and 56 million in 2003 included in these amounts are primarily interest and dividend income of 111 million 77 million and 68 million and net foreign exchange transaction losses of 47 million 90 million and 28 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

loss on debt redemption and repurchases

income taxes 

the companys effective income tax rate was 321 in 2005 333 in 2004 and 362 in 2003 the decrease in the 2005 effective income tax rate compared with 2004 was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for tax matters for periods that have closed in the relevant jurisdictions the company currently expects an effective income tax rate of approximately 333 for 2006 

the decrease in the 2004 effective income tax rate compared with 2003 was primarily due to improved tax efficiencies resulting from reorganizing the companys international subsidiaries tax effects from debt retirement state taxes and a change in foreign tax law partially offset by some of the 2004 business restructuring expenses which the company could not recognize for tax purposes 

in 2005 and 2004 the effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate of 350 primarily due to the lower net effective income tax rate on foreign earnings partially offset by the effect of state income taxes in 2003 the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and nondeductible expenses partially offset by the lower net effective tax rate on foreign earnings 

the american jobs creation act known as the ajca provided for a deduction of 85 of qualifying foreign earnings that the company could have repatriated in 2005 after considering global cash management objectives its overall tax position and restrictions on the use of repatriated cash the company did not repatriate any qualifying foreign earnings in 2005 

the ajca also provided for a deduction in 2005 for qualified production activities this deduction did not have a material impact on the companys 2005 effective income tax rate

the basic earnings per common share calculations for 2003 include gains of 08 million attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock the company did not recognize any such gains for 2005 and 2004 since it had redeemed all shares of its outstanding preferred stock during the third quarter of 2003 

in calculating diluted earnings per common share the companys calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2005 2004 and 2003 provides for the conversion of the companys 3 convertible senior notes due june 2033 due to the application of eitf issue no 0408 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share the assumed issuance of

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 

the company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements note 20 new accounting pronouncements—recently issued statements of financial accounting standards accounting guidance and disclosure requirements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements which is contained in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k describes these new accounting pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america known as us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed may differ from estimates and while any differences may be material to the companys consolidated financial statements the company does not believe that the differences taken as a whole will be material 

the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

notes and accounts receivable—in the normal course of business the company extends credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria notes and accounts receivable as shown on the consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the companys customers deteriorates 

commitments and contingencies—litigation—on an ongoing basis the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses the company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be 

reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made the company expenses legal costs including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred 

impairment of longlived assets—the company periodically reviews longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses such as future cash flows and disposition costs may affect the carrying value of longlived assets and possible impairment expense in the companys consolidated financial statements 

selfinsurance—the company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property casualty workers compensation and employee benefit claims the company accrues for outstanding reported claims claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 

pensions—the company maintains a noncontributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate for a limited number of its us employees and for some of its nonus employees the company maintains defined benefit pension plans the company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions under these accounting standards the company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations the expected future rate of return on plan assets the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions in general changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 87 since only a limited number of employees are covered by these plans such impact is not considered material to the company 

income taxes—the companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards the company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely the company provides a valuation allowance 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could materially impact the companys consolidated financial statements 

in calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes the company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired based on this review the company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices which may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company does not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time the company may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

the companys interest rate swaps are described in note 11 derivatives and hedging activities of the notes to the consolidated financial statements which is contained in item 8 of part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

under the terms of the companys outstanding interest rate swap agreements in each year the company received interest at a fixed rate and paid interest at variable rates that were based on sixmonth london interbank offered rate or libor as a result under the terms of the outstanding interest rate swap agreements in each year interest expense increased 16 million decreased 62 million and decreased 42 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively due to changes in sixmonth libor 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 the company had no collars or options outstanding 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 the carrying value of the companys total debt which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps was 20762 million and 21116 million respectively the companys fixed rate debt at december 31 2005 and 2004 including the impact of interest rate swaps was 17677 million and 18005 million respectively the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise the estimated fair value of the companys total debt including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps was 21357 million at december 31 2005 compared with 22316 million at december 31 2004 a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2005 of 734 million these changes in the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt do not alter the companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies the terms of these instruments are generally twelve months or less at december 31 2005 and 2004 the company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 3093 million and 3423 million respectively the estimated fair values of these contracts which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates was a net receivable at december 31 2005 of 06 million and zero at december 31 2004 a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2005 would have caused the company to pay approximately 208 million to terminate these contracts 

the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing these instruments can potentially limit 

foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2005 and 2004 the company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 

the companys outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was 2629 million and 2920 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities 

commodities 

the company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes generally the company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices moreover the companys supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories the company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements as a result the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 

net sales 

the principal factors affecting changes in net sales in the three years ended december 31 2002 were changes in unit volume including the added net sales of acquired businesses changes in product mix and average selling prices and foreign currency translation 

net sales in 2002 increased 4 to 3204256000 compared with 3067482000 for 2001 which were essentially even compared with 3067714000 in 2000 

the increase in net sales in 2002 was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and to a lesser extent the added net sales of acquired businesses partially offset by unfavorable changes in product pricemix foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact of approximately 17000000 in 2002 

net sales in 2001 were essentially even compared to 2000 due to the net effect of added net sales of acquired businesses offset by lower unit volume for certain products and the negative effect of foreign currency translation foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately 75000000 in 2001 excluding the negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales would have increased 2 compared to 2000 

the favorable impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2002 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in europe and the asiapacific region compared with the us dollar partially offset by the weakness of the argentine peso and the brazilian real the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2001 was primarily due to the weakness of foreign currencies in the asiapacific region europe and latin america compared with the us dollar 

net sales from operations in the united states represented approximately 55 of net sales in each of 2002 2001 and 2000 net sales from us operations increased approximately 5 in 2002 to 1758761000 compared with 1680204000 for 2001 this increase was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and to a lesser extent the added net sales of acquired businesses partially offset by unfavorable changes in product pricemix net sales from us operations in 2001 decreased approximately 1 to 1680204000 compared to 1689467000 in 2000 this decrease was primarily due to lower unit volume for certain products partially offset by the added net sales of acquired businesses 

net sales from foreign operations increased approximately 4 in 2002 to 1445495000 compared with 1387278000 for 2001 primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and to a lesser extent approximately 17000000 from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation discussed above excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation net sales from foreign operations would have increased 3 compared to 2001 net sales from foreign operations increased 1 in 2001 to 1387278000 compared with 1378247000 in 2000 due primarily to the added net sales of acquired businesses partially offset by the negative effect of foreign currency translation of approximately 75000000 discussed above excluding the negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales from foreign operations would have increased 6 compared to 2000 

net sales of the companys food packaging segment which consists primarily of the companys cryovac® food packaging products constituted 61 of net sales in each of 2002 and 2001 and 60 in 2000 net sales of the companys protective and specialty packaging segment which includes the aggregation of the companys protective packaging products engineered products and shrink packaging products all of which are used principally for nonfood packaging applications constituted the balance of net sales 

food packaging segment sales 

net sales of food packaging products increased 4 in 2002 to 1958078000 compared to 1880281000 in 2001 and increased 2 in 2001 compared to 1837294000 in 2000 the increase in 

2002 was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact on this segment of approximately 10000000 in 2002 the increase in 2001 was due to the added net sales of acquired businesses and to a lesser extent higher average selling prices and higher unit volume for certain products partially offset by approximately 50000000 from the negative effect of foreign currency translation excluding this negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales would have increased 5 in 2001 compared to 2000 early in 2001 this segment experienced disruptions due to reductions in meat supply caused by an outbreak of footandmouth disease and declines in beef consumption resulting from concerns over bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or madcow disease principally in europe as these concerns abated in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 supply and consumption returned to more normal levels 

among the classes of products in the food packaging segment in 2002 net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems increased 4 to 1657185000 compared with 1592142000 for 2001 which were essentially even compared with 1599230000 in 2000 net sales increased in 2002 primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact of approximately 6000000 in 2002 for flexible materials and related systems net sales of these products in 2001 were flat compared to 2000 due to the net effect of higher average selling prices for certain flexible packaging materials and to a lesser extent the added net sales of acquired businesses offset by approximately 44000000 from the negative effect of foreign currency translation excluding this negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 2 in 2001 

net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads increased 4 to 300893000 in 2002 compared with 288139000 for 2001 and increased 21 in 2001 compared with 238064000 in 2000 the increase in net sales in these products in 2002 was primarily due to favorable changes in product pricemix and to a lesser extent a favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 4000000 excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 3 in 2002 the increase in 2001 was primarily due to the added net sales of the dolphin packaging business which was acquired in 2000 and other smaller businesses and to a lesser extent higher unit volume for certain products partially offset by a negative effect of foreign currency translation of approximately 6000000 excluding the negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 23 in 2001 

protective and specialty packaging segment sales 

net sales of protective and specialty packaging products increased 5 to 1246178000 in 2002 compared with 1187201000 in 2001 but decreased 4 in 2001 compared with 1230420000 in 2000 the increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and the added net sales of acquired businesses partially offset by unfavorable changes in product pricemix foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact in 2002 of approximately 7000000 for the protective and specialty packaging segment the decrease in net sales in 2001 was due primarily to lower unit volume for certain products due to the recessionary environment and to a lesser extent approximately 25000000 from the negative effect of foreign currency translation partially offset by the added net sales of acquired businesses excluding this negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales would have decreased 2 in 2001 

costs and margins 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 330 in 2002 323 in 2001 and 337 in 2000 the increase in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to higher unit volumes in both reportable business segments the decrease in 2001 was primarily due to lower sales volume of certain protective and specialty packaging products as well as changes in product mix compared to the 2000 period and was partially offset by lower costs for certain raw materials 

marketing administrative and development expenses increased 6 in 2002 but declined 1 in 2001 the increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher expenses for certain corporate projects insurance costs the effects of businesses acquired and the impact of foreign currency translation the decline in 2001 was attributable to cost control measures and the impact of foreign currency translation marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 169 in 2002 167 in 2001 and 168 in 2000 

beginning january 1 2002 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 the company ceased recording goodwill amortization expense in its consolidated statement of operations goodwill amortization expense was 57005000 in 2001 and 51776000 in 2000 the increase in 2001 compared to 2000 was due to acquisitions see below under recently issued statements of financial accounting standards for a discussion of this new standard 

2001 restructuring program 

during 2001 based primarily on weakening economic conditions especially in the us the company conducted a review of its business to reduce costs and expenses simplify business processes and organizational structure and to refine further the companys manufacturing operations and product offerings as a result of such review which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company announced and began implementing a restructuring program that resulted in charges to operations of 32805000 for 2001 such charges included the following 



the portion of this restructuring charge related to the companys food packaging segment was 21116000 and the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment was 11689000 

the company originally expected to incur 25518000 of cash outlays to carry out this restructuring program such cash outlays included primarily severance and other personnelrelated costs as well as lease and other contractual arrangement termination costs as of december 31 2002 the company had made total cash payments of approximately 17600000 of which approximately 11779000 were made in 2002 and 5821000 were made in 2001 the cash restructuring liability recorded in 2001 of 25518000 was adjusted in 2002 for a net credit of 1348000 discussed below after such cash outlays and the net credit the restructuring liability at december 31 2002 was 6570000 representing cash outlays expected to be made in 2003 and future years primarily for severancerelated costs the 2001 restructuring program was substantially completed at december 31 2002 

the longlived asset impairment of 7287000 included the following writedowns and writeoffs 



these longlived asset impairments related to decisions to rationalize and realign production of certain small product lines and to close several manufacturing and warehouse facilities in north america europe south africa and the asia pacific region the annual reduction of depreciation and amortization expense as a result of such asset impairments was 365000 the company has disposed of all of the above property plant and equipment 

during 2002 the company made an adjustment to the original 2001 restructuring provision resulting in a net credit to the consolidated statement of operations of 1348000 the portion of this net credit related to the companys food packaging segment amounted to a credit of 2957000 while the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment amounted to a charge of 1609000 such adjustment resulted from the completion of certain actions for amounts different than expected certain headcount reductions obtained through attrition and the revision of a plan to shut down one of the companys manufacturing facilities 

as a result of the 2002 adjustments to the 2001 restructuring program the company now expects a net reduction in headcount of approximately 440 positions this program originally estimated a net headcount reduction of approximately 470 the revised net headcount reduction was reduced by approximately 30 positions that were eliminated by attrition this net reduction consists of the elimination of 677 positions from all geographic areas in which the company does business but primarily from its manufacturing sales and marketing functions in north america and europe as of december 31 2002 657 of these 677 positions had been eliminated the company also anticipates the addition of 237 positions in connection with its realignment or relocation of certain manufacturing activities 

the company estimates that approximately 23000000 in annualized cost savings on a full year run rate basis were realized by the end of 2002 the estimated annual cost savings include the 365000 noncash annual reduction of depreciation expense discussed above although certain cost aspects of the original program have been adjusted the original cost saving targets have been maintained 

operating profit 

operating profit increased 33 in 2002 but decreased 17 in 2001 the increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased net sales the discontinuance in 2002 of the amortization of goodwill and the restructuring and other charges incurred in 2001 while a restructuring credit was recorded in 2002 excluding goodwill amortization in 2001 of 57005000 and restructuring and other credits in 2002 of 1348000 and restructuring and other charges in 2001 of 32805000 operating profit would have increased 8 in 2002 the decrease in 2001 was primarily due to the 2001 restructuring and other charges and the lower gross profit discussed above as a percentage of net sales operating profit was 161 in 2002 126 in 2001 and 153 in 2000 excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring and other credits charges operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 161 in 2002 156 in 2001 and 169 in 2000 in 2000 goodwill amortization was 51776000 and restructuring and other credits was 1247000 

the food packaging segment contributed 60 58 and 54 of the companys operating profit in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively before taking into consideration corporate operating expenses and restructuring and other credits charges the companys protective and specialty packaging segment contributed the balance of operating profit corporate operating expenses in 2001 and 2000 consisted primarily of goodwill amortization

the company recorded a charge of 850118000 as a result of the asbestos settlement in the consolidated statement of operations as of december 31 2002 such expense consisted of the following items 

• a noncash charge of 512500000 covering a cash payment required to be made by the company upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of new grace because it is uncertain when such a plan of reorganization may become effective this liability has been recorded as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2002 under the terms of the settlement this amount accrues interest at a 55 annual rate from december 21 2002 to the date of payment such interest through december 31 2002 amounted to 861000 and is included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet • a noncash charge of 321480000 representing the fair market value of 9000000 shares of the companys common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to such settlement upon the effectiveness of new graces plan of reorganization such shares are subject to customary antidilution provisions including the effects of stock splits stock dividends and certain other events affecting the companys common stock such fair market value was 3572 per common share as of the close of business on december 5 2002 such amount has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2002 as follows 900000 representing the aggregate par value of such shares has been recorded in common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement and the remaining 320580000 representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate par value of such common shares has been recorded in additional paidin capital the shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement are not reflected in the 2002 loss per common share calculations since the effect would be antidilutive ie would reduce the loss per common share • 16138000 of legal and related fees in 2001 other expense in the consolidated statement of operations included 11995000 of expense of which 8149000 was primarily a result of the companys guarantee entered into at the time of the cryovac transaction of certain debt payable by w r grace  co — conn which filed for reorganization along with new grace and 3846000 of legal and related fees 

interest expense and other income expense net 

including 2002 interest expense relating to the asbestos settlement discussed above interest expense decreased 15 in 2002 but increased 18 in 2001 the decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower average levels of outstanding debt the increase in 2001 was primarily due to higher average levels of debt outstanding during 2001 compared to the corresponding 2000 period primarily due to additional borrowings made in 2000 in connection with business acquisitions and stock repurchases made under the companys stock repurchase program 

other income expense net consisted of income of 7114000 in 2002 expense of 1546000 in 2001 and income of 9479000 in 2000 the change in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to lower net foreign exchange losses during 2002 the change in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to a onetime cash fee of 10000000 received in 2000 from a third party for the assignment of a contract 

income taxes 

the companys effective income tax rate was a benefit of 211 in 2002 compared to an expense of 473 in 2001 and 455 in 2000 the effective tax rate in 2002 was lower than 2001 due primarily to the impact of the asbestos settlement and its related costs and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in 2002 the effective tax rate in 2001 was higher than 2000 due primarily to lower earnings before income taxes 

in 2002 the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate primarily due to the effect of the estimated tax benefit for the asbestos settlement in 2001 and 2000 the effective tax rates were higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate primarily due to the nondeductibility of goodwill amortization for tax purposes and to a lesser extent state income taxes 

net loss earnings 

as a result of the asbestos settlement and related costs of 850118000 in 2002 the company had a net loss of 309069000 in 2002 compared to net earnings of 156697000 in 2001 net earnings decreased 30 to 156697000 in 2001 compared to 225319000 in 2000 excluding goodwill amortization of 57005000 and 51776000 in 2001 and 2000 respectively net earnings would have been 213702000 in 2001 and 277095000 in 2000 

basic loss earnings per common share were 420 for 2002 130 for 2001 and 247 for 2000 diluted loss earnings per common share were 430 for 2002 122 for 2001 and 193 for 2000 excluding goodwill amortization in 2001 and 2000 basic earnings per common share would have been 199 and 308 respectively and diluted earnings per common share would have been 189 and 252 in 2001 and 2000 respectively 

the basic earnings per common share calculations for 2002 2001 and 2000 include 012 009 and 054 per share of gains excess of book value over repurchase price of preferred stock respectively attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock in the period to calculate diluted earnings per common share the excess of book value over the repurchase price of the companys series a preferred stock in 2002 2001 and 2000 of 10291000 7456000 and 45283000 respectively were excluded from the calculations 

the diluted earnings per common share in each period were calculated assuming conversion of the shares of preferred stock repurchased during each of the respective periods in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards emerging issues task force topic d53 guidance the effect of the conversion of the companys outstanding convertible preferred stock was not considered in the calculations of diluted earnings per common share for any of the 2002 2001 and 2000 periods presented because the effect would be antidilutive since such assumed conversions may be included only if the resulting impact would dilute earnings per common share 

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and amounts available under the companys existing lines of credit which are described below 

asbestos settlement 

as noted above the company recorded a noncash charge of 512500000 in 2002 covering a cash payment required to be made by the company upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of new grace no cash was used in 2002 with respect to this liability and it is currently uncertain when the company will be required to make this payment the company currently expects to fund this payment either by using accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations from the proceeds of future financings or from a combination of such alternatives 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 323939000 in 2002 578693000 in 2001 and 329413000 in 2000 the decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the following 

• changes in receivables interests sold under the receivables facility described below at december 31 2002 the financial institutions participating in the facility held no interests in the companys us accounts receivable while at december 31 2001 those institutions held 95600000 of such interests and • changes in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business as discussed below under changes in working capital partially offset by 

• increased earnings excluding the noncash impact of the asbestos settlement the increase in 2001 was primarily due to the following 

• changes in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business as discussed below under changes in working capital and • the implementation of the receivables facility in 2001 described below partially offset by • the companys lower net earnings in 2001 investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities amounted to 96888000 in 2002 177932000 in 2001 and 348989000 in 2000 in each year investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions the decrease in net cash used in these activities in 2002 was due to lower levels of capital expenditures and to a lesser extent acquisitions the decrease in net cash used in 2001 was due to a lower level of acquisition activity partially offset by a higher level of capital expenditures in 2002 cash used to complete acquisitions was 10465000 compared to 36007000 in 2001 and 237541000 in 2000 in each year cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired in those acquisitions cash acquired in acquisitions was not material in 2002 or 2001 and was 8589000 in 2000 the company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2002 in 2001 and 2000 the company assumed approximately 19000000 and 16600000 respectively of debt in acquisitions

the decrease in capital expenditures in 2002 was primarily due to improved productivity of existing assets allowing the company to defer spending on incremental capacity the increase in capital expenditures in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the management of capital planning and project spending the company currently anticipates that capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2003 will be in the range of 125000000 to 150000000

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2001 reflected primarily net debt repayments of 312907000 and the timing difference relating to the payment of dividends on the companys outstanding series a convertible preferred stock discussed above partially offset by a decrease in cash used to purchase the companys capital stock proceeds from longterm debt in 2001 included 295773000 of net proceeds from the issuance on june 26 2001 of 300000000 aggregate principal amount of 875 senior notes due july 1 2008 the 875 senior notes

changes in working capital 

at december 31 2002 the companys working capital was a net liability of 96496000 primarily due to recording as a current liability the 512500000 portion of the asbestos settlement liability to be funded in cash compared to working capital that was a net asset of 149372000 or 4 of total assets at december 31 2001 

the other changes to working capital excluding the asbestos settlement liability were primarily the following changes in the ordinary course of business 

• increase in other current liabilities primarily due to the timing of payments which included payrollrelated costs customer volume rebates income taxes payable and the dividend payable 18 

on january 2 2002 on the companys outstanding series a convertible preferred stock discussed above partially offset by a decrease in the restructuring liability due to cash payments of approximately 11779000 made during 2002 

• increase in accounts payable partially due to the timing of payments to vendors and to a lesser extent the increased levels of inventory as discussed below partially offset by 

• increase in cash • increase of approximately 128600000 in notes and accounts receivable primarily due to activities under the receivables facility described below and to a lesser extent increased net sales during the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to the fourth quarter of 2001 • increase in inventory primarily due to increased raw material prices and • decrease in shortterm borrowings primarily due to changes in shortterm liquidity requirements including the refinancing of certain shortterm borrowings with longterm debt current and quick ratios 

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities current ratio was 09 at december 31 2002 and 12 at december 31 2001 the ratio of current assets less inventory to current liabilities quick ratio was 06 at december 31 2002 and 08 at december 31 2001 

accounts receivable facility 

in december 2001 the company and certain of its us subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program the receivables facility with a bank the bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank the icp under the receivables facility the companys two primary operating subsidiaries cryovac inc and sealed air corporation us the originators sell all of their eligible us accounts receivable to sealed air funding corporation sa funding corp an indirectly whollyowned subsidiary of the company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables facility sa funding corp in turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables receivables interests to the bank and the icp subject to certain conditions up to a maximum of 125000000 of receivables interests outstanding from time to time 

sa funding corp retains the receivables it purchases from the originators except those as to which receivables interests are sold by it to the bank or the icp sales of accounts receivable by the originators to sa funding corp and sales of receivables interests from sa funding corp to the bank and the icp have been structured as true sales under applicable laws and the assets of sa funding corp are not available to pay any creditors of the company or of its subsidiaries or affiliates these transactions are accounted for as sales of receivables under the provisions of sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 

in order to secure the performance of their obligations under the receivables facility sa funding corp and the originators granted a first priority security interest to the bank as agent in certain collateral including accounts receivable owned by them and proceeds and collections of those receivables the bank and the icp have no recourse to the companys the originators or sa funding corps other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due as long as a termination event with respect to the receivables facility has not occurred the originators service administer and collect the receivables under the receivables facility as agent on behalf of sa funding corp the bank and the icp prior to a termination event under the receivables facility collections of receivables not otherwise required to 

be paid to the bank or the icp are used by sa funding corp to purchase new eligible receivables from the originators the company has undertaken to cause the originators to perform their obligations under the receivables facility 

the scheduled expiration date for the receivables facility is december 7 2004 the bank has extended its commitment to make purchases of receivables interests from sa funding corp from december 7 2002 to january 26 2004 however under the terms of the extension sa funding corp may not sell any receivables interests to the bank or the icp until a definitive settlement agreement satisfactory to the bank has been entered into relating to the asbestos settlement 

under certain limited circumstances the bank and the icp can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to the above dates events that could result in termination of the receivables facility include a downgrade of the companys longterm senior unsecured debt to bb or below by standard  poors rating services standard  poors or ba3 or below by moodys investors service inc moodys and failure to comply with interest coverage and debt leverage ratios in connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs the company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the receivables facility after reflecting such waiver the company was in compliance with the requirements of the receivables facility as of december 31 2002 since such waiver was as of december 31 2002 the company anticipates that it will request a waiver or amendment for future applicable periods 

the receivables facility provides for the payment from time to time of program fees which after the banks extension of the facility to january 2004 were 045 per annum 0375 per annum at december 31 2002 on the receivables interests sold by sa funding corp and commitment fees which were 040 per annum 0325 per annum at december 31 2002 on the unused portion of the 125000000 receivables facility 

during 2002 sa funding corp sold receivables interests to the icp from time to time however as of december 31 2002 neither the bank nor the icp held any receivables interests 

in december 2001 receivables sold by the originators to sa funding corp amounted to approximately 176900000 sa funding corp in turn sold receivables interests of 95600000 under the receivables facility and this amount was removed from the companys consolidated balance sheet this amount was used to pay down certain of the companys outstanding borrowings sa funding corp retained the remaining 81300000 of receivables that it acquired from the originators these retained receivables at december 31 2001 were included in notes and accounts receivable on the companys consolidated balance sheet the carrying amount of the retained receivables approximates fair value because of the relatively shortterm nature of the receivables 

the costs associated with the receivables facility are included in other income expense net in the companys consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 these costs primarily relate to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the bank or the icp which were approximately 409000 and 75000 for 2002 and 2001 respectively and program and commitment fees and other associated costs which were approximately 400000 and 343000 for 2002 and 2001 respectively 

the company considers that when available the receivables facility provides an additional source of shortterm liquidity to the company 

outstanding indebtedness 

at december 31 2002 and 2001 the companys total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth on the following table amounts in table in thousands of dollars 

 1 the carrying value of the euro notes increased approximately 29000 primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro compared to the us dollar during 2002 in march 2002 the company refinanced a portion of its shortterm borrowings in australia and new zealand under an australian dollar 175000000 approximately us 92300000 at the then current exchange rate dualcurrency revolving credit facility that expires on march 12 2005 the anz facility this facility was made available to certain of the companys australian and new zealand subsidiaries by a syndicate of banks and such borrowings are guaranteed by the company the amount outstanding under this facility at december 31 2002 was approximately 57500000 such amount is included in other longterm debt in the table above 

substantially all the companys shortterm borrowings of 53355000 at december 31 2002 were outstanding under lines of credit available to various of the companys us and foreign subsidiaries amounts available under these credit lines as of december 31 2002 and 2001 were approximately 209000000 and 326000000 respectively of which approximately 155000000 and 190000000 respectively were unused 

at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit including the credit lines discussed above of approximately 832000000 and 1046000000 respectively of which approximately 721000000 and 903000000 respectively were unused such credit lines include amounts available under the 2003 facility defined below the 364day facility defined below at december 31 2001 and other lines of credit available to the companys subsidiaries as of december 31 2002 the total lines of credit of 832000000 include committed lines of credit of approximately 622000000 and uncommitted lines of credit of approximately 210000000 such committed lines of credit primarily include the 2003 facility and the anz facility the company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit 

at december 31 2002 the companys principal revolving credit facility was a 525000000 facility that expires on march 30 2003 the 2003 facility the company has considered various financing 

alternatives for the replacement of the 2003 facility the company believes that its current financial resources and cash flows do not require that the company replace the 2003 facility since its net cash provided by operating activities net of cash used in investing activities together with its cash on hand and amounts available under other committed lines of credit are adequate to meet its current operating and investing needs as well as to pay its current debt obligations at december 31 2002 of 55404000 in 2002 the companys operating activities provided net cash of 323939000 and its investing activities used net cash of 96888000 while the company expects it will be able to obtain any additional financing required for general corporate needs including the funding of the cash payment for the asbestos settlement when it is required to be made upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of new grace there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to the company on commercially favorable terms 

as of december 31 2002 facility fees were payable at the rate of 0095 per annum under the 2003 facility on the total amounts available under the credit facility the obligations under the 2003 facility bear interest at floating rates the floating rates are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period the weighted average interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the 2003 facility was approximately 42 at december 31 2001 there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2003 facility as of december 31 2002 

the 2003 facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the companys longterm senior unsecured debt ratings and certain financial criteria the 2003 facility  the anz facility the euro notes the 875 senior notes and the 695 senior notes impose limitations on the operations of the company and certain of its subsidiaries these limitations include depending upon the debt in question financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage as well as restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness the creation of liens sale and leaseback transactions mergers and acquisitions and certain dispositions of assets in connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs the company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the 2003 facility after reflecting such waiver the company was in compliance with the requirements of each of the above instruments as of december 31 2002 

the company had a 364day 194375000 revolving credit facility the 364day facility that the company allowed to expire on march 22 2002 no borrowings were outstanding under this facility at the time of its expiration or at december 31 2001 

the companys cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings which are periodically reviewed by the credit rating agencies the companys longterm senior unsecured debt is currently rated baa3 negative outlook by moodys and bbb credit watch with negative implications by standard  poors these ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment grade longterm senior unsecured debt a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

in june 2002 the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 50000000 that were qualified and designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 137 and sfas no 138 these agreements were entered into in order to among other things convert a portion of the 875 senior notes fixed rate debt into floating rate debt during september 2002 the company terminated these swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the 875 senior notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately 2416000 such amount is being amortized and reflected as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the 875 

senior notes the company was not party to any interest rate swap agreements at december 31 2002 or 2001 

the following table summarizes the companys material contractual obligations at december 31 2002 that require cash outlays in 2003 and future years amounts in table in thousands of dollars 

 1 includes principal maturities only 2 assumes dividends are declared and paid each quarter until march 31 2018 based on shares outstanding at december 31 2002 and that no shares are converted to common stock or otherwise retired the total cash outlay of 2136478 includes 1327005 for the 5000 per share redemption value and 809473 for the amount of the dividends assumed to be declared and paid each quarter until march 31 2018 3 this liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment as discussed below interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 55 per annum until it becomes due and payable in addition to the obligation to pay the principal amount of the debt obligations discussed above the company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering many of the facilities that it occupies substantially all of which are accounted for as operating leases the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable real property leases as of december 31 2002 the longterm debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of december 31 2002 and therefore represents the principal amount of such debt required to be repaid in each period the series a convertible preferred stock in the table above is subject to mandatory redemption on march 31 2018 at 5000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to the extent these shares remain outstanding these shares receive a cumulative cash dividend as declared by the board of directors at an annual rate of 200 per share payable quarterly in arrears until mandatory redemption on march 31 2018 see below under series a convertible preferred stock for further discussion 

as described above in asbestos settlement and related costs the company recorded a current liability of 512500000 for the cash portion to be paid plus accrued interest at a 55 annual rate which started on december 21 2002 the company is required to make such payment upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of new grace because it is uncertain when such a plan of reorganization may become effective this liability has been recorded as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2002 the company currently expects to 

fund this payment either by using accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations from the proceeds of future financings or from a combination of such alternatives 

the company entered into the following longterm commitments during 2002 

• approximately 36000000 for the purchase of certain equipment over an eightyear period beginning in 2003 together with a potential termination fee in an amount to be determined the companys obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and certain indexes failure to purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the company to pay an amount of 45 of such shortfall • approximately 9500000 to a supplier if the company fails to purchase 142700000 pounds of certain raw materials at the then current market price over a tenyear period that began in may 2002 the amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the companys purchase of minimum quantities required under the contract at december 31 2002 the companys purchases were in line with the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement derivative financial instruments 

at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company was party to foreign currency forward contracts which did not have a significant impact on the companys liquidity for further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments see item 7a other matters — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

cryovac transaction 

on march 31 1998 the company completed a multistep transaction the cryovac transaction which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air corporation old sealed air under the common ownership of the company these businesses operate as subsidiaries of the company and the company acts as a holding company as part of that transaction the cryovac packaging business held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company was separated from the remaining businesses of the company such remaining businesses were then contributed to a company now known as w r grace  co new grace whose shares were distributed to the companys stockholders as a result new grace became a separate publicly owned company the company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock a subsidiary of the company then merged into old sealed air which changed its name to sealed air corporation us the agreements pursuant to which the cryovac transaction was carried out are referred to below as the transaction agreements 

contingencies related to the cryovac transaction 

in connection with the cryovac transaction new grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction whether accruing or occurring before or after the cryovac transaction other than liabilities arising from or relating to cryovacs operations the liabilities retained by new grace include among others liabilities relating to asbestoscontaining products previously manufactured or sold by new graces subsidiaries prior to the cryovac transaction including its primary us operating subsidiary w r grace  co — conn which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of new grace since the cryovac transaction the transaction agreements provided that should any claimant seek to hold the company including any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities of new grace or its subsidiaries including such asbestosrelated liabilities new grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the company 

since the beginning of 2000 the company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction the company is responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of new grace and its subsidiaries certain of which were also named as codefendants in some of these actions these actions include several purported class actions and a number of personal injury lawsuits some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death while others seek medical monitoring environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product neither old sealed air nor cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestoscontaining materials that are the subjects of these cases none of these cases has been resolved through judgment settlement or otherwise all such cases have been stayed in connection with new graces chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding discussed below 

while the allegations in these actions directed to the company vary these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business as part of the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability under a theory of successor liability plaintiffs with claims against new grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the company liable for liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the cryovac transaction by w r grace  co — conn or other new grace subsidiaries a transfer would be a fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer was engaged or was about to engage in a business for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature a transfer may also be fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud creditors if any transfers in connection with the cryovac transaction were found by a court to be fraudulent transfers the company could be required to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund certain liabilities of new grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors including asbestos claimants the company has reached an agreement in principle described below that will resolve all such claims previously the company was unable to estimate the loss or range of loss in the event that there had been a finding that the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability 

in the joint proxy statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the cryovac transaction both sealed air and grace stated that it was their belief that new grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the cryovac transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the cryovac transaction would be a fraudulent transfer they also stated their belief that the cryovac transaction complied with other relevant laws however if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached conclusions adverse to the company such determination could have had a materially adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations and financial position 

on april 2 2001 new grace and certain of its subsidiaries filed a petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court in the district of delaware new grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999 

in connection with its chapter 11 filing new grace filed an application with the bankruptcy court seeking to stay among others all actions brought against the company including certain of its subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of new grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims the court issued an order dated may 3 2001 which was modified on january 22 2002 under which all such filed or pending actions against the company were stayed and all such future actions are stayed upon filing and service on the company no further proceedings involving the company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the bankruptcy court 

committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in new graces bankruptcy case received the courts permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its 

subsidiary cryovac inc and against fresenius as discussed below the claims against fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between fresenius and w r grace  co — conn fresenius is not affiliated with the company in march 2002 the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of new grace following the cryovac transaction and whether new grace received reasonably equivalent value in the cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf of all creditors of new grace the proceeding is pending in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware adv no 0202210 

in june 2002 the court permitted the us government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding so that the us government could pursue allegations that remediation expenses at certain sites were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of new grace that were conducted at the time of the cryovac transaction the court also permitted new grace which asserted that the cryovac transaction was not a fraudulent transfer to intervene in the proceeding in july 2002 the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the trial holding among other things that subject to certain limitations post1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of new grace the company believes that only claims and liabilities that were known or reasonably should have been known at the time of the 1998 cryovac transaction should be considered pursuant to the applicable standard 

on september 20 2002 in an unrelated bankruptcy case official committee of unsecured creditors of cybergenics corp v chinery 304 f3d 316 3d cir 2002 the united states court of appeals for the third circuit held that only a trustee in bankruptcy or a debtorinpossession could prosecute a fraudulent transfer action since the plaintiffs in the fraudulent transfer case against the company were the committees and not such a trustee or debtor and since the law of the third circuit is binding in the district of new jersey where the proceeding was pending it was uncertain whether the committees had authority under the law to prosecute the constructive fraudulent transfer case and accordingly the future posture of the case was uncertain in light of the cybergenics decision on september 27 2002 the court postponed the trial date which had originally been set for september 30 2002 and then on october 24 2002 issued an order rescheduling the trial to begin on december 2 2002 but granting the parties permission to ask the third circuit to hear an immediate appeal of the order on october 31 2002 the company asked the third circuit for permission to appeal the order given these circumstances the company did not know whether the committees would be permitted to prosecute the fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company or whether the third circuit might hold that some other party perhaps the debtorinpossession or a trustee might have to prosecute these claims if it so chose in the w r grace bankruptcy proceeding the debtorinpossession had already taken the position that it did not believe that the 1998 transaction was a fraudulent transfer 

on november 18 2002 judge alfred m wolin the judge hearing the companys case advised the parties that the cybergenics decision would be reheard en banc which had the effect of vacating the prior decision under third circuit rules judge wolin also ordered the companys fraudulent conveyance trial to commence on december 9 2002 and ordered the parties to appear for mediation on november 27 2002

environmental matters 

the company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries if any the company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations balance sheets or cash flows environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated these liabilities are evaluated periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated the company adjusts the recorded accruals as necessary the company believes that such exposures are not material to the companys consolidated results of operations and financial position the company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards 

in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 141 business combinations sfas no 141 and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 sfas no 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june 30 2001 sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 this new standard also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 141 upon issuance and adopted sfas no 142 effective january 1 2002 any goodwill and any intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june 30 2001 were not amortized but were evaluated for impairment 

goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july 1 2001 were amortized through the end of 2001 

in connection with the transitional impairment evaluation sfas no 142 required the company to assess whether goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired as of january 1 2002 as required by this statement the company completed its assessment process on a reporting unit basis as of june 30 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary as of january 1 2002 a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment the component level discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and such businesses have economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segments in which case such component is the reporting unit a fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment an impairment charge is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value an estimate of fair values for the company as a whole and each of the companys reporting units was derived by using discounted cash flows equity market capitalization and comparative market multiples 

as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of 1926244000 and 1913000000 respectively amortization expense related to goodwill was 57005000 and 51776000 in 2001 and 2000 respectively beginning january 1 2002 in accordance with sfas no 142 the company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill although goodwill will no longer be systematically amortized this statement requires that periodic reviews be conducted to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired such reviews could result in future writedowns of goodwill which would be reflected as a charge against operating income 

as required by sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have to be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 the company completed its annual testing for impairment for 2002 during the fourth quarter of 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a reporting unit basis 

as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of approximately 69100000 and 63600000 respectively less accumulated amortization of approximately 47700000 and 40100000 respectively such identifiable intangible assets therefore are immaterial to the companys consolidated balance sheets amortization of identifiable intangible assets was approximately 7200000 for 2002 assuming no change in the gross carrying value of identifiable intangible assets from the value at december 31 2002 the estimated amortization for the year ended december 31 2003 and the next four succeeding years is approximately 7200000 per year such assets are reflected in other assets in the companys consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2002 and 2001 there were no identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as defined by sfas no 142 

on january 1 2003 the company adopted sfas no 143 asset retirement obligations sfas no 143 which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets this statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred the adoption of sfas no 143 did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

on january 1 2002 the company adopted sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 which excludes from the definition of longlived assets goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized in accordance with sfas no 142 sfas no 144 requires that the disposal of longlived assets by sale be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations sfas no 144 also expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have been or will be disposed of rather than limiting such discontinuance to a segment of a 

business the adoption of sfas no 144 did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 146 sfas no 146 nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 943 and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred under eitf 943 a liability for an exit cost was required to be recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan the adoption of sfas no 146 is expected to result in delayed recognition for certain types of costs as compared to the provisions of eitf 943 sfas no 146 is effective for new exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 and does not affect amounts currently reported in the companys consolidated financial statements sfas no 146 will affect the types and timing of costs included in future restructuring programs if any 

on january 1 2003 the company adopted sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure sfas no 148 which provides alternative methods of transition for companies that choose to switch to the fair value method of accounting for stock options sfas no 148 also makes changes in the disclosure requirements for stockbased compensation regardless of which method of accounting is chosen as discussed above under financing activities the company terminated all previously maintained stock option plans effective march 31 1998 in connection with the cryovac transaction except with respect to options that were still outstanding as of such date the adoption of sfas no 148 did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others interpretation no 45 interpretation no 45 requires the disclosure of certain guarantees existing at december 31 2002 the company had no guarantees meeting the requirements of interpretation no 45 at december 31 2002 in addition interpretation no 45 requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities that are initiated or modified after december 31 2002 accordingly the company will apply the recognition provisions of interpretation no 45 prospectively to applicable guarantee activities initiated after december 31 2002 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation no 46 interpretation no 46 requires that the assets liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has the controlling financial interest interpretation no 46 also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to it interpretation no 46 will be effective for the company on february 1 2003 for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and on july 31 2003 for variable interest entities created prior to february 1 2003 based on its preliminary analysis of interpretation no 46 the company does not currently expect the adoption of interpretation no 46 to have a material impact on its 2003 consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the companys discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing 

basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed may differ from estimates and any such differences may be material to the companys consolidated financial statements 

the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the companys customers deteriorates 

commitments and contingencies — litigation—on an ongoing basis the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against the company while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses the company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made 

impairment of longlived assets—the company periodically reviews longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses such as future cash flows and disposition costs may affect the carrying value of longlived assets and possible impairment expense in the companys consolidated financial statements  

selfinsurance — the company retains the obligation for certain claims and losses related to property casualty workers compensation and employee benefit claims the company accrues for outstanding reported claims claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 

pensions — although the company maintains a noncontributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate the company does maintain defined benefit pension plans for certain of its us and nonus employees the company accounts for such pension plans in accordance with sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 87 under these accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets certain of these assumptions include the discount rate used to measure future obligations the expected future rate of return on plan assets the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 87 

income taxes — the companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carryforwards the company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could materially impact the companys consolidated financial statements 

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements made by the company in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference herein and in future oral and written statements by the company may be forwardlooking these statements include comments as to the companys beliefs and expectations as to future events and trends affecting the companys business its results of operations and its financial condition these forwardlooking statements are based upon managements current expectations concerning future events and discuss among other things anticipated future performance and future business plans forwardlooking statements are identified by such words and phrases as expects intends believes will continue plans to could be estimates and similar expressions forwardlooking statements are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside the control of the company which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements 

the company recognizes that it is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect the future performance of the company such as

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company does not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time the company may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during september 2002 the company terminated certain interest rate swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the 875 senior notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately 2416000 such amount is being amortized and reflected as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the 875 senior notes at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had no interest rate swaps collars or options outstanding 

the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise at december 31 2002 the carrying value of the companys total debt was 923434000 of which approximately 812569000 was fixed rate debt at december 31 2001 the carrying value of the companys total debt was 925602000 of which 782517000 was fixed rate debt the estimated fair value of the companys total debt which includes the cost of replacing the companys fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates was approximately 958256000 at december 31 2002 compared to 889434000 at december 31 2001 a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2002 of approximately 25656000 such changes in the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt do not alter the companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 

the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies the terms of such instruments are generally twelve months or less at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 146910000 and 266900000 respectively the estimated fair values of these contracts which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates were a net payable of approximately 32000 and a net receivable of approximately 313000 at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2002 would have caused the company to pay approximately 650000 to terminate these contracts 

the companys foreign subsidiaries had outstanding debt of approximately 322700000 and 321700000 at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively such debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities thereby reducing its need to enter into foreign exchange contracts 

commodities 

the company uses various commodity raw material and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing processes generally the company acquires such components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices as a result the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 

net sales 

the principal factors affecting changes in net sales in the three years ended december 31 2002 were changes in unit volume including the added net sales of acquired businesses changes in product mix and average selling prices and foreign currency translation 

net sales in 2002 increased 4 to 3204256000 compared with 3067482000 for 2001 which were essentially even compared with 3067714000 in 2000 

the increase in net sales in 2002 was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and to a lesser extent the added net sales of acquired businesses partially offset by unfavorable changes in product pricemix foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact of approximately 17000000 in 2002 

net sales in 2001 were essentially even compared to 2000 due to the net effect of added net sales of acquired businesses offset by lower unit volume for certain products and the negative effect of foreign currency translation foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of approximately 75000000 in 2001 excluding the negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales would have increased 2 compared to 2000 

the favorable impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2002 was primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies in europe and the asiapacific region compared with the us dollar partially offset by the weakness of the argentine peso and the brazilian real the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2001 was primarily due to the weakness of foreign currencies in the asiapacific region europe and latin america compared with the us dollar 

net sales from operations in the united states represented approximately 55 of net sales in each of 2002 2001 and 2000 net sales from us operations increased approximately 5 in 2002 to 1758761000 compared with 1680204000 for 2001 this increase was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and to a lesser extent the added net sales of acquired businesses partially offset by unfavorable changes in product pricemix net sales from us operations in 2001 decreased approximately 1 to 1680204000 compared to 1689467000 in 2000 this decrease was primarily due to lower unit volume for certain products partially offset by the added net sales of acquired businesses 

net sales from foreign operations increased approximately 4 in 2002 to 1445495000 compared with 1387278000 for 2001 primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and to a lesser extent approximately 17000000 from the favorable impact of foreign currency translation discussed above excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation net sales from foreign operations would have increased 3 compared to 2001 net sales from foreign operations increased 1 in 2001 to 1387278000 compared with 1378247000 in 2000 due primarily to the added net sales of acquired businesses partially offset by the negative effect of foreign currency translation of approximately 75000000 discussed above excluding the negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales from foreign operations would have increased 6 compared to 2000 

net sales of the companys food packaging segment which consists primarily of the companys cryovac® food packaging products constituted 61 of net sales in each of 2002 and 2001 and 60 in 2000 net sales of the companys protective and specialty packaging segment which includes the aggregation of the companys protective packaging products engineered products and shrink packaging products all of which are used principally for nonfood packaging applications constituted the balance of net sales 

food packaging segment sales 

net sales of food packaging products increased 4 in 2002 to 1958078000 compared to 1880281000 in 2001 and increased 2 in 2001 compared to 1837294000 in 2000 the increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact on this segment of approximately 10000000 in 2002 the increase in 2001 was due to the added net sales of acquired businesses and to a lesser extent higher average selling prices and higher unit volume for certain products partially offset by approximately 50000000 from the negative effect of foreign currency translation excluding this negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales would have increased 5 in 2001 compared to 2000 early in 2001 this segment experienced disruptions due to reductions in meat supply caused by an outbreak of footandmouth 

disease and declines in beef consumption resulting from concerns over bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or madcow disease principally in europe as these concerns abated in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 supply and consumption returned to more normal levels 

among the classes of products in the food packaging segment in 2002 net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems increased 4 to 1657185000 compared with 1592142000 for 2001 which were essentially even compared with 1599230000 in 2000 net sales increased in 2002 primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact of approximately 6000000 in 2002 for flexible materials and related systems net sales of these products in 2001 were flat compared to 2000 due to the net effect of higher average selling prices for certain flexible packaging materials and to a lesser extent the added net sales of acquired businesses offset by approximately 44000000 from the negative effect of foreign currency translation excluding this negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales of flexible packaging materials and related systems would have increased 2 in 2001 

net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads increased 4 to 300893000 in 2002 compared with 288139000 for 2001 and increased 21 in 2001 compared with 238064000 in 2000 the increase in net sales in these products in 2002 was primarily due to favorable changes in product pricemix and to a lesser extent a favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 4000000 excluding the positive effect of foreign currency translation net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 3 in 2002 the increase in 2001 was primarily due to the added net sales of the dolphin packaging business which was acquired in 2000 and other smaller businesses and to a lesser extent higher unit volume for certain products partially offset by a negative effect of foreign currency translation of approximately 6000000 excluding the negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales of rigid packaging and absorbent pads would have increased 23 in 2001 

protective and specialty packaging segment sales 

net sales of protective and specialty packaging products increased 5 to 1246178000 in 2002 compared with 1187201000 in 2001 but decreased 4 in 2001 compared with 1230420000 in 2000 the increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher unit volume for certain products and the added net sales of acquired businesses partially offset by unfavorable changes in product pricemix foreign currency translation had a modestly favorable impact in 2002 of approximately 7000000 for the protective and specialty packaging segment the decrease in net sales in 2001 was due primarily to lower unit volume for certain products due to the recessionary environment and to a lesser extent approximately 25000000 from the negative effect of foreign currency translation partially offset by the added net sales of acquired businesses excluding this negative effect of foreign currency translation net sales would have decreased 2 in 2001 

costs and margins 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 330 in 2002 323 in 2001 and 337 in 2000 the increase in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to higher unit volumes in both reportable business segments the decrease in 2001 was primarily due to lower sales volume of certain protective and specialty packaging products as well as changes in product mix compared to the 2000 period and was partially offset by lower costs for certain raw materials 

marketing administrative and development expenses increased 6 in 2002 but declined 1 in 2001 the increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher expenses for certain corporate projects insurance costs the effects of businesses acquired and the impact of foreign currency translation the decline in 2001 was attributable to cost control measures and the impact of foreign currency translation marketing administrative and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 169 in 2002 167 in 2001 and 168 in 2000 

beginning january 1 2002 in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 the company ceased recording goodwill amortization expense in its consolidated statement of operations goodwill amortization expense was 57005000 in 2001 and 51776000 in 2000 the increase in 2001 compared to 2000 was due to acquisitions see below under recently issued statements of financial accounting standards for a discussion of this new standard 

2001 restructuring program 

during 2001 based primarily on weakening economic conditions especially in the us the company conducted a review of its business to reduce costs and expenses simplify business processes and organizational structure and to refine further the companys manufacturing operations and product offerings as a result of such review which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2001 the company announced and began implementing a restructuring program that resulted in charges to operations of 32805000 for 2001 such charges included the following 



the portion of this restructuring charge related to the companys food packaging segment was 21116000 and the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment was 11689000 

the company originally expected to incur 25518000 of cash outlays to carry out this restructuring program such cash outlays included primarily severance and other personnelrelated costs as well as lease and other contractual arrangement termination costs as of december 31 2002 the company had made total cash payments of approximately 17600000 of which approximately 11779000 were made in 2002 and 5821000 were made in 2001 the cash restructuring liability recorded in 2001 of 25518000 was adjusted in 2002 for a net credit of 1348000 discussed below after such cash outlays and the net credit the restructuring liability at december 31 2002 was 6570000 representing cash outlays expected to be made in 2003 and future years primarily for severancerelated costs the 2001 restructuring program was substantially completed at december 31 2002 

the longlived asset impairment of 7287000 included the following writedowns and writeoffs 



these longlived asset impairments related to decisions to rationalize and realign production of certain small product lines and to close several manufacturing and warehouse facilities in north america europe south africa and the asia pacific region the annual reduction of depreciation and amortization expense as a result of such asset impairments was 365000 the company has disposed of all of the above property plant and equipment 

during 2002 the company made an adjustment to the original 2001 restructuring provision resulting in a net credit to the consolidated statement of operations of 1348000 the portion of this net credit 

related to the companys food packaging segment amounted to a credit of 2957000 while the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment amounted to a charge of 1609000 such adjustment resulted from the completion of certain actions for amounts different than expected certain headcount reductions obtained through attrition and the revision of a plan to shut down one of the companys manufacturing facilities 

as a result of the 2002 adjustments to the 2001 restructuring program the company now expects a net reduction in headcount of approximately 440 positions this program originally estimated a net headcount reduction of approximately 470 the revised net headcount reduction was reduced by approximately 30 positions that were eliminated by attrition this net reduction consists of the elimination of 677 positions from all geographic areas in which the company does business but primarily from its manufacturing sales and marketing functions in north america and europe as of december 31 2002 657 of these 677 positions had been eliminated the company also anticipates the addition of 237 positions in connection with its realignment or relocation of certain manufacturing activities 

the company estimates that approximately 23000000 in annualized cost savings on a full year run rate basis were realized by the end of 2002 the estimated annual cost savings include the 365000 noncash annual reduction of depreciation expense discussed above although certain cost aspects of the original program have been adjusted the original cost saving targets have been maintained 

operating profit 

operating profit increased 33 in 2002 but decreased 17 in 2001 the increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased net sales the discontinuance in 2002 of the amortization of goodwill and the restructuring and other charges incurred in 2001 while a restructuring credit was recorded in 2002 excluding goodwill amortization in 2001 of 57005000 and restructuring and other credits in 2002 of 1348000 and restructuring and other charges in 2001 of 32805000 operating profit would have increased 8 in 2002 the decrease in 2001 was primarily due to the 2001 restructuring and other charges and the lower gross profit discussed above as a percentage of net sales operating profit was 161 in 2002 126 in 2001 and 153 in 2000 excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring and other credits charges operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 161 in 2002 156 in 2001 and 169 in 2000 in 2000 goodwill amortization was 51776000 and restructuring and other credits was 1247000 

the food packaging segment contributed 60 58 and 54 of the companys operating profit in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively before taking into consideration corporate operating expenses and restructuring and other credits charges the companys protective and specialty packaging segment contributed the balance of operating profit corporate operating expenses in 2001 and 2000 consisted primarily of goodwill amortization

interest expense and other income expense net 

including 2002 interest expense relating to the asbestos settlement discussed above interest expense decreased 15 in 2002 but increased 18 in 2001 the decrease in 2002 was primarily due to lower average levels of outstanding debt the increase in 2001 was primarily due to higher average levels of debt outstanding during 2001 compared to the corresponding 2000 period primarily due to additional borrowings made in 2000 in connection with business acquisitions and stock repurchases made under the companys stock repurchase program 

other income expense net consisted of income of 7114000 in 2002 expense of 1546000 in 2001 and income of 9479000 in 2000 the change in 2002 compared to 2001 was due to lower net foreign exchange losses during 2002 the change in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to a onetime cash fee of 10000000 received in 2000 from a third party for the assignment of a contract 

income taxes 

the companys effective income tax rate was a benefit of 211 in 2002 compared to an expense of 473 in 2001 and 455 in 2000 the effective tax rate in 2002 was lower than 2001 due primarily to the impact of the asbestos settlement and its related costs and the discontinuance of goodwill 

amortization in 2002 the effective tax rate in 2001 was higher than 2000 due primarily to lower earnings before income taxes 

in 2002 the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate primarily due to the effect of the estimated tax benefit for the asbestos settlement in 2001 and 2000 the effective tax rates were higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate primarily due to the nondeductibility of goodwill amortization for tax purposes and to a lesser extent state income taxes 

net loss earnings 

as a result of the asbestos settlement and related costs of 850118000 in 2002 the company had a net loss of 309069000 in 2002 compared to net earnings of 156697000 in 2001 net earnings decreased 30 to 156697000 in 2001 compared to 225319000 in 2000 excluding goodwill amortization of 57005000 and 51776000 in 2001 and 2000 respectively net earnings would have been 213702000 in 2001 and 277095000 in 2000

the basic earnings per common share calculations for 2002 2001 and 2000 include 012 009 and 054 per share of gains excess of book value over repurchase price of preferred stock respectively attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock in the period to calculate diluted earnings per common share the excess of book value over the repurchase price of the companys series a preferred stock in 2002 2001 and 2000 of 10291000 7456000 and 45283000 respectively were excluded from the calculations 

the diluted earnings per common share in each period were calculated assuming conversion of the shares of preferred stock repurchased during each of the respective periods in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards emerging issues task force topic d53 guidance the effect of the conversion of the companys outstanding convertible preferred stock was not considered in the calculations of diluted earnings per common share for any of the 2002 2001 and 2000 periods presented because the effect would be antidilutive since such assumed conversions may be included only if the resulting impact would dilute earnings per common share 

liquidity and capital resources 

the companys principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and amounts available under the companys existing lines of credit which are described below 

asbestos settlement 

as noted above the company recorded a noncash charge of 512500000 in 2002 covering a cash payment required to be made by the company upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of new grace no cash was used in 2002 with respect to this liability and it is currently uncertain when the company will be required to make this payment the company currently expects to fund this payment either by using accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations from the proceeds of future financings or from a combination of such alternatives 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 323939000 in 2002 578693000 in 2001 and 329413000 in 2000 the decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the following 

• changes in receivables interests sold under the receivables facility described below at december 31 2002 the financial institutions participating in the facility held no interests in the companys us accounts receivable while at december 31 2001 those institutions held 95600000 of such interests and • changes in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business as discussed below under changes in working capital partially offset by 

• increased earnings excluding the noncash impact of the asbestos settlement the increase in 2001 was primarily due to the following 

• changes in operating assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business as discussed below under changes in working capital and • the implementation of the receivables facility in 2001 described below partially offset by 

• the companys lower net earnings in 2001 investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities amounted to 96888000 in 2002 177932000 in 2001 and 348989000 in 2000 in each year investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions the decrease in net cash used in these activities in 2002 was due to lower levels of capital expenditures and to a lesser extent acquisitions the decrease in net cash used in 2001 was due to a lower level of acquisition activity partially offset by a higher level of capital expenditures in 2002 cash used to complete acquisitions was 10465000 compared to 36007000 in 2001 and 237541000 in 2000 in each year cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired in those acquisitions cash acquired in acquisitions was not material in 2002 or 2001 and was 8589000 in 2000 the company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2002 in 2001 and 2000 the company assumed approximately 19000000 and 16600000 respectively of debt in acquisitions

the decrease in capital expenditures in 2002 was primarily due to improved productivity of existing assets allowing the company to defer spending on incremental capacity the increase in capital expenditures in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the management of capital planning and project spending the company currently anticipates that capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2003 will be in the range of 125000000 to 150000000 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities amounted to 101501000 in 2002 and 402583000 in 2001 while net cash provided by financing activities amounted to 7671000 in 2000 the company continued to

the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2001 reflected primarily net debt repayments of 312907000 and the timing difference relating to the payment of dividends on the companys outstanding series a convertible preferred stock discussed above partially offset by a decrease in cash used to purchase the companys capital stock proceeds from longterm debt in 2001 included 295773000 of net proceeds from the issuance on june 26 2001 of 300000000 aggregate principal amount of 875 senior notes due july 1 2008 the 875 senior notes 

included in financing activities in 2002 2001 and 2000 are proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 917000 504000 and 861000 respectively these stock options were granted prior to 1998 and were exercised pursuant to plans in which certain employees of the cryovac packaging business participated the stock option plans were terminated effective march 31 1998 in connection with the cryovac transaction except with respect to options that were still outstanding as of such date

changes in working capital 

at december 31 2002 the companys working capital was a net liability of 96496000 primarily due to recording as a current liability the 512500000 portion of the asbestos settlement liability to be funded in cash compared to working capital that was a net asset of 149372000 or 4 of total assets at december 31 2001 

the other changes to working capital excluding the asbestos settlement liability were primarily the following changes in the ordinary course of business 

• increase in other current liabilities primarily due to the timing of payments which included payrollrelated costs customer volume rebates income taxes payable and the dividend payable 18 

on january 2 2002 on the companys outstanding series a convertible preferred stock discussed above partially offset by a decrease in the restructuring liability due to cash payments of approximately 11779000 made during 2002

the ratio of current assets to current liabilities current ratio was 09 at december 31 2002 and 12 at december 31 2001 the ratio of current assets less inventory to current liabilities quick ratio was 06 at december 31 2002 and 08 at december 31 2001 

accounts receivable facility 

in december 2001 the company and certain of its us subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program the receivables facility with a bank the bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank the icp under the receivables facility the companys two primary operating subsidiaries cryovac inc and sealed air corporation us the originators sell all of their eligible us accounts receivable to sealed air funding corporation sa funding corp an indirectly whollyowned subsidiary of the company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables facility sa funding corp in turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables receivables interests to the bank and the icp subject to certain conditions up to a maximum of 125000000 of receivables interests outstanding from time to time 

sa funding corp retains the receivables it purchases from the originators except those as to which receivables interests are sold by it to the bank or the icp sales of accounts receivable by the originators to sa funding corp and sales of receivables interests from sa funding corp to the bank and the icp have been structured as true sales under applicable laws and the assets of sa funding corp are not available to pay any creditors of the company or of its subsidiaries or affiliates these transactions are accounted for as sales of receivables under the provisions of sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 

in order to secure the performance of their obligations under the receivables facility sa funding corp and the originators granted a first priority security interest to the bank as agent in certain collateral including accounts receivable owned by them and proceeds and collections of those receivables the bank and the icp have no recourse to the companys the originators or sa funding corps other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due as long as a termination event with respect to the receivables facility has not occurred the originators service administer and collect the receivables under the receivables facility as agent on behalf of sa funding corp the bank and the icp prior to a termination event under the receivables facility collections of receivables not otherwise required to 

be paid to the bank or the icp are used by sa funding corp to purchase new eligible receivables from the originators the company has undertaken to cause the originators to perform their obligations under the receivables facility 

the scheduled expiration date for the receivables facility is december 7 2004 the bank has extended its commitment to make purchases of receivables interests from sa funding corp from december 7 2002 to january 26 2004 however under the terms of the extension sa funding corp may not sell any receivables interests to the bank or the icp until a definitive settlement agreement satisfactory to the bank has been entered into relating to the asbestos settlement 

under certain limited circumstances the bank and the icp can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to the above dates events that could result in termination of the receivables facility include a downgrade of the companys longterm senior unsecured debt to bb or below by standard  poors rating services standard  poors or ba3 or below by moodys investors service inc moodys and failure to comply with interest coverage and debt leverage ratios in connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs the company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the receivables facility after reflecting such waiver the company was in compliance with the requirements of the receivables facility as of december 31 2002 since such waiver was as of december 31 2002 the company anticipates that it will request a waiver or amendment for future applicable periods 

the receivables facility provides for the payment from time to time of program fees which after the banks extension of the facility to january 2004 were 045 per annum 0375 per annum at december 31 2002 on the receivables interests sold by sa funding corp and commitment fees which were 040 per annum 0325 per annum at december 31 2002 on the unused portion of the 125000000 receivables facility 

during 2002 sa funding corp sold receivables interests to the icp from time to time however as of december 31 2002 neither the bank nor the icp held any receivables interests 

in december 2001 receivables sold by the originators to sa funding corp amounted to approximately 176900000 sa funding corp in turn sold receivables interests of 95600000 under the receivables facility and this amount was removed from the companys consolidated balance sheet this amount was used to pay down certain of the companys outstanding borrowings sa funding corp retained the remaining 81300000 of receivables that it acquired from the originators these retained receivables at december 31 2001 were included in notes and accounts receivable on the companys consolidated balance sheet the carrying amount of the retained receivables approximates fair value because of the relatively shortterm nature of the receivables 

the costs associated with the receivables facility are included in other income expense net in the companys consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 these costs primarily relate to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the bank or the icp which were approximately 409000 and 75000 for 2002 and 2001 respectively and program and commitment fees and other associated costs which were approximately 400000 and 343000 for 2002 and 2001 respectively 

the company considers that when available the receivables facility provides an additional source of shortterm liquidity to the company 

outstanding indebtedness 

at december 31 2002 and 2001 the companys total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth on the following table amounts in table in thousands of dollars 

 1 the carrying value of the euro notes increased approximately 29000 primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro compared to the us dollar during 2002 in march 2002 the company refinanced a portion of its shortterm borrowings in australia and new zealand under an australian dollar 175000000 approximately us 92300000 at the then current exchange rate dualcurrency revolving credit facility that expires on march 12 2005 the anz facility this facility was made available to certain of the companys australian and new zealand subsidiaries by a syndicate of banks and such borrowings are guaranteed by the company the amount outstanding under this facility at december 31 2002 was approximately 57500000 such amount is included in other longterm debt in the table above 

substantially all the companys shortterm borrowings of 53355000 at december 31 2002 were outstanding under lines of credit available to various of the companys us and foreign subsidiaries amounts available under these credit lines as of december 31 2002 and 2001 were approximately 209000000 and 326000000 respectively of which approximately 155000000 and 190000000 respectively were unused 

at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit including the credit lines discussed above of approximately 832000000 and 1046000000 respectively of which approximately 721000000 and 903000000 respectively were unused such credit lines include amounts available under the 2003 facility defined below the 364day facility defined below at december 31 2001 and other lines of credit available to the companys subsidiaries as of december 31 2002 the total lines of credit of 832000000 include committed lines of credit of approximately 622000000 and uncommitted lines of credit of approximately 210000000 such committed lines of credit primarily include the 2003 facility and the anz facility the company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit 

at december 31 2002 the companys principal revolving credit facility was a 525000000 facility that expires on march 30 2003 the 2003 facility the company has considered various financing 

alternatives for the replacement of the 2003 facility the company believes that its current financial resources and cash flows do not require that the company replace the 2003 facility since its net cash provided by operating activities net of cash used in investing activities together with its cash on hand and amounts available under other committed lines of credit are adequate to meet its current operating and investing needs as well as to pay its current debt obligations at december 31 2002 of 55404000 in 2002 the companys operating activities provided net cash of 323939000 and its investing activities used net cash of 96888000 while the company expects it will be able to obtain any additional financing required for general corporate needs including the funding of the cash payment for the asbestos settlement when it is required to be made upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of new grace there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to the company on commercially favorable terms 

as of december 31 2002 facility fees were payable at the rate of 0095 per annum under the 2003 facility on the total amounts available under the credit facility the obligations under the 2003 facility bear interest at floating rates the floating rates are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period the weighted average interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the 2003 facility was approximately 42 at december 31 2001 there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2003 facility as of december 31 2002 

the 2003 facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the companys longterm senior unsecured debt ratings and certain financial criteria the 2003 facility  the anz facility the euro notes the 875 senior notes and the 695 senior notes impose limitations on the operations of the company and certain of its subsidiaries these limitations include depending upon the debt in question financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage as well as restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness the creation of liens sale and leaseback transactions mergers and acquisitions and certain dispositions of assets in connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs the company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the 2003 facility after reflecting such waiver the company was in compliance with the requirements of each of the above instruments as of december 31 2002 

the company had a 364day 194375000 revolving credit facility the 364day facility that the company allowed to expire on march 22 2002 no borrowings were outstanding under this facility at the time of its expiration or at december 31 2001 

the companys cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by its debt ratings which are periodically reviewed by the credit rating agencies the companys longterm senior unsecured debt is currently rated baa3 negative outlook by moodys and bbb credit watch with negative implications by standard  poors these ratings are among the ratings assigned by each of these organizations for investment grade longterm senior unsecured debt a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 

in june 2002 the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 50000000 that were qualified and designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 137 and sfas no 138 these agreements were entered into in order to among other things convert a portion of the 875 senior notes fixed rate debt into floating rate debt during september 2002 the company terminated these swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the 875 senior notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately 2416000 such amount is being amortized and reflected as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the 875 

senior notes the company was not party to any interest rate swap agreements at december 31 2002 or 2001 

the following table summarizes the companys material contractual obligations at december 31 2002 that require cash outlays in 2003 and future years amounts in table in thousands of dollars 

 1 includes principal maturities only 2 assumes dividends are declared and paid each quarter until march 31 2018 based on shares outstanding at december 31 2002 and that no shares are converted to common stock or otherwise retired the total cash outlay of 2136478 includes 1327005 for the 5000 per share redemption value and 809473 for the amount of the dividends assumed to be declared and paid each quarter until march 31 2018 3 this liability is reflected as a current liability due to the uncertainty of the timing of payment as discussed below interest accrues on this amount at a rate of 55 per annum until it becomes due and payable in addition to the obligation to pay the principal amount of the debt obligations discussed above the company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering many of the facilities that it occupies substantially all of which are accounted for as operating leases the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable real property leases as of december 31 2002 the longterm debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of december 31 2002 and therefore represents the principal amount of such debt required to be repaid in each period the series a convertible preferred stock in the table above is subject to mandatory redemption on march 31 2018 at 5000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to the extent these shares remain outstanding these shares receive a cumulative cash dividend as declared by the board of directors at an annual rate of 200 per share payable quarterly in arrears until mandatory redemption on march 31 2018 see below under series a convertible preferred stock for further discussion 

as described above in asbestos settlement and related costs the company recorded a current liability of 512500000 for the cash portion to be paid plus accrued interest at a 55 annual rate which started on december 21 2002 the company is required to make such payment upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of new grace because it is uncertain when such a plan of reorganization may become effective this liability has been recorded as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2002 the company currently expects to 

fund this payment either by using accumulated cash and future cash flows from operations from the proceeds of future financings or from a combination of such alternatives 

the company entered into the following longterm commitments during 2002 

• approximately 36000000 for the purchase of certain equipment over an eightyear period beginning in 2003 together with a potential termination fee in an amount to be determined the companys obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and certain indexes failure to purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the company to pay an amount of 45 of such shortfall • approximately 9500000 to a supplier if the company fails to purchase 142700000 pounds of certain raw materials at the then current market price over a tenyear period that began in may 2002 the amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the companys purchase of minimum quantities required under the contract at december 31 2002 the companys purchases were in line with the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement derivative financial instruments 

at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company was party to foreign currency forward contracts which did not have a significant impact on the companys liquidity for further discussion about these contracts and other financial instruments see item 7a other matters — quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

cryovac transaction 

on march 31 1998 the company completed a multistep transaction the cryovac transaction which brought the cryovac packaging business and the former sealed air corporation old sealed air under the common ownership of the company these businesses operate as subsidiaries of the company and the company acts as a holding company as part of that transaction the cryovac packaging business held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company was separated from the remaining businesses of the company such remaining businesses were then contributed to a company now known as w r grace  co new grace whose shares were distributed to the companys stockholders as a result new grace became a separate publicly owned company the company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock a subsidiary of the company then merged into old sealed air which changed its name to sealed air corporation us the agreements pursuant to which the cryovac transaction was carried out are referred to below as the transaction agreements 

contingencies related to the cryovac transaction 

in connection with the cryovac transaction new grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the cryovac transaction whether accruing or occurring before or after the cryovac transaction other than liabilities arising from or relating to cryovacs operations the liabilities retained by new grace include among others liabilities relating to asbestoscontaining products previously manufactured or sold by new graces subsidiaries prior to the cryovac transaction including its primary us operating subsidiary w r grace  co — conn which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of new grace since the cryovac transaction the transaction agreements provided that should any claimant seek to hold the company including any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities of new grace or its subsidiaries including such asbestosrelated liabilities new grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the company 

since the beginning of 2000 the company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that as a result of the cryovac transaction the company is responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of new grace and its subsidiaries certain of which were also named as codefendants in some of these actions these actions include several purported class actions and a number of personal injury lawsuits some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death while others seek medical monitoring environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product neither old sealed air nor cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestoscontaining materials that are the subjects of these cases none of these cases has been resolved through judgment settlement or otherwise all such cases have been stayed in connection with new graces chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding discussed below 

while the allegations in these actions directed to the company vary these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the cryovac business as part of the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability under a theory of successor liability plaintiffs with claims against new grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the company liable for liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the cryovac transaction by w r grace  co — conn or other new grace subsidiaries a transfer would be a fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer was engaged or was about to engage in a business for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature a transfer may also be fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud creditors if any transfers in connection with the cryovac transaction were found by a court to be fraudulent transfers the company could be required to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund certain liabilities of new grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors including asbestos claimants the company has reached an agreement in principle described below that will resolve all such claims previously the company was unable to estimate the loss or range of loss in the event that there had been a finding that the cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability 

in the joint proxy statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the cryovac transaction both sealed air and grace stated that it was their belief that new grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the cryovac transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the cryovac transaction would be a fraudulent transfer they also stated their belief that the cryovac transaction complied with other relevant laws however if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached conclusions adverse to the company such determination could have had a materially adverse effect on the companys consolidated results of operations and financial position 

on april 2 2001 new grace and certain of its subsidiaries filed a petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court in the district of delaware new grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999 

in connection with its chapter 11 filing new grace filed an application with the bankruptcy court seeking to stay among others all actions brought against the company including certain of its subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of new grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims the court issued an order dated may 3 2001 which was modified on january 22 2002 under which all such filed or pending actions against the company were stayed and all such future actions are stayed upon filing and service on the company no further proceedings involving the company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the bankruptcy court 

committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in new graces bankruptcy case received the courts permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the company and its subsidiary cryovac inc and against fresenius as discussed below the claims against fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between fresenius and w r grace  co — conn fresenius is not affiliated with the company in march 2002 the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of new grace following the cryovac transaction and whether new grace received reasonably equivalent value in the cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf of all creditors of new grace the proceeding is pending in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware adv no 0202210 

in june 2002 the court permitted the us government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding so that the us government could pursue allegations that remediation expenses at certain sites were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of new grace that were conducted at the time of the cryovac transaction the court also permitted new grace which asserted that the cryovac transaction was not a fraudulent transfer to intervene in the proceeding in july 2002 the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the trial holding among other things that subject to certain limitations post1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of new grace the company believes that only claims and liabilities that were known or reasonably should have been known at the time of the 1998 cryovac transaction should be considered pursuant to the applicable standard the trial was scheduled to commence december 9 2002 

on november 27 2002 the company reached an agreement in principle with the committees prosecuting the claims against the company and cryovac inc to resolve all current and future asbestosrelated claims arising from the cryovac transaction on the same day the court entered an order confirming that an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties had been reached and that counsel for the company and the committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of the agreement in principle as discussed above the agreement in principle calls for payment of 9000000 shares of sealed air common stock and 512500000 in cash plus interest on the cash payment at a 55 annual rate starting on december 21 2002 and ending on the effective date of the new grace plan of reorganization when payment must be made such shares are subject to customary antidilution provisions including the effects of stock splits stock dividends and certain other events affecting the companys common stock pursuant to the agreement the company cannot seek indemnity from new grace for this payment on december 3 2002 the agreement in principle was approved by the companys board of directors the company was advised that both of the committees had approved the agreement in principle as of december 5 2002 the parties are jointly engaged in the process of drafting a definitive settlement agreement consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle once signed by the appropriate parties the settlement agreement will be presented to the court for approval and will eventually be incorporated into new graces plan of reorganization and assuming approval by new graces creditors as part of the approval of the plan of reorganization will then be implemented 

the settlement upon approval and implementation in the new grace bankruptcy will provide that upon the effective date of new graces plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash all present and future asbestosrelated claims against the company and its affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of new grace and its affiliates including former affiliates that became affiliates of the company through the cryovac transaction will be channeled to and become the responsibility of one or more trusts to be established as part of new graces plan of reorganization the settlement will also resolve all fraudulent transfer claims against the company and its affiliates arising from the cryovac transaction as well as the claims of fresenius described below the settlement will provide that the company and its affiliates will receive releases of all such claims as a condition to the companys obligation to make the payments required by the settlement new graces plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement including provisions for the trusts and releases referred to above and for an injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestosrelated 

claims against the company and its affiliates it is expected that the order approving the settlement agreement will also provide that the stay of proceedings involving the company described above will continue through the effective date of new graces plan of reorganization after which the company will be released from the liabilities asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against the company will be enjoined 

in january 2002 the company filed a declaratory judgment action against fresenius medical care holdings inc its parent fresenius ag a german company and certain of its affiliates collectively fresenius in new york state court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties fresenius contended that the company was obligated to indemnify fresenius for certain liabilities that fresenius might incur as a result of the 1996 fresenius transaction mentioned above freseniuss contention was based on its interpretation of the agreements between fresenius and w r grace  co — conn in connection with the 1996 fresenius transaction in february 2002 fresenius announced that it had accrued a charge of 172000000 for such potential liabilities which include pretransaction tax liabilities of new grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from new graces chapter 11 filing the company believed that it was not responsible to indemnify fresenius under the 1996 agreements and filed the action in order to proceed to a resolution of freseniuss claims in april 2002 fresenius filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor the company opposed the motion and in june 2002 the court reserved decision after oral argument no written order has been issued and the parties have requested the court to defer issuing a ruling pending implementation of the definitive settlement agreement between the company and the committees as noted above as a result of the november 27 2002 agreement in principle referred to above the parties expect that there will be mutual releases exchanged between fresenius and the company releasing any and all claims related to the 1996 fresenius transaction 

in view of new graces chapter 11 filing the company may receive additional claims asserting that the company is liable for obligations that new grace had agreed to retain in the cryovac transaction and for which the company may be contingently liable to date no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the company 

final determinations and accountings under the transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the cryovac transaction had not been completed at the time of new graces chapter 11 filing the company expects to file a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding that will include all of the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that new grace agreed to retain or that are subject to indemnification by new grace under the transaction agreements other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement new grace alleges that the company is responsible for certain amounts under the transaction agreements any amounts for which the company may be liable to new grace may be used to offset new graces liabilities to the company costs and liabilities for which the company intends to seek indemnification by new grace will also include certain defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the fresenius claims the guaranteed debt paid by the company described above and any of the other potential claims against the company mentioned above except to the extent of any potential setoff or similar claim the company expects that its claim will be as an unsecured creditor of new grace it is not currently possible to determine the amount of the companys claim against new grace the extent to which such claim may be secured by setoff how much of that claim may be allowed or the amount of the companys recovery on such claim if any in the bankruptcy proceeding 

environmental matters 

the company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated these accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance 

recoveries if any environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated these liabilities are evaluated periodically based on available information including the progress of remedial investigations at each site the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties as some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated the company adjusts the recorded accruals as necessary the company believes that such exposures are not material to the companys consolidated results of operations and financial position the company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures 

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards 

in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 141 business combinations sfas no 141 and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 142 sfas no 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june 30 2001 sfas no 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 this new standard also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 141 upon issuance and adopted sfas no 142 effective january 1 2002 any goodwill and any intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june 30 2001 were not amortized but were evaluated for impairment goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july 1 2001 were amortized through the end of 2001 

in connection with the transitional impairment evaluation sfas no 142 required the company to assess whether goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired as of january 1 2002 as required by this statement the company completed its assessment process on a reporting unit basis as of june 30 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary as of january 1 2002 a reporting unit is the operating segment unless at businesses one level below that operating segment the component level discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and such businesses have economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segments in which case such component is the reporting unit a fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment an impairment charge is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value an estimate of fair values for the company as a whole and each of the companys reporting units was derived by using discounted cash flows equity market capitalization and comparative market multiples 

as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of 1926244000 and 1913000000 respectively amortization expense related to goodwill was 57005000 and 51776000 in 2001 and 2000 respectively beginning january 1 2002 in accordance with sfas no 142 the company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill although goodwill will no longer be systematically amortized this statement requires that periodic reviews be conducted to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired such reviews could result in future writedowns of goodwill which would be reflected as a charge against operating income 

as required by sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have to be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 142 the 

company completed its annual testing for impairment for 2002 during the fourth quarter of 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a reporting unit basis 

as of december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of approximately 69100000 and 63600000 respectively less accumulated amortization of approximately 47700000 and 40100000 respectively amortization of identifiable intangible assets was approximately 7200000 for 2002 assuming no change in the gross carrying value of identifiable intangible assets from the value at december 31 2002 the estimated amortization for the year ended december 31 2003 and the next four succeeding years is approximately 7200000 per year such assets are reflected in other assets in the companys consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2002 and 2001 there were no identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as defined by sfas no 142 

on january 1 2003 the company adopted sfas no 143 asset retirement obligations sfas no 143 which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible longlived assets this statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred the adoption of sfas no 143 did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

on january 1 2002 the company adopted sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 which excludes from the definition of longlived assets goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized in accordance with sfas no 142 sfas no 144 requires that the disposal of longlived assets by sale be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations sfas no 144 also expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have been or will be disposed of rather than limiting such discontinuance to a segment of a business the adoption of sfas no 144 did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 146 sfas no 146 nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 943 and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred under eitf 943 a liability for an exit cost was required to be recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan the adoption of sfas no 146 is expected to result in delayed recognition for certain types of costs as compared to the provisions of eitf 943 sfas no 146 is effective for new exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 and does not affect amounts currently reported in the companys consolidated financial statements sfas no 146 will affect the types and timing of costs included in future restructuring programs if any 

on january 1 2003 the company adopted sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure sfas no 148 which provides alternative methods of transition for companies that choose to switch to the fair value method of accounting for stock options sfas no 148 also makes changes in the disclosure requirements for stockbased compensation regardless of which method of accounting is chosen as discussed above under financing activities the company terminated all previously maintained stock option plans effective march 31 1998 in connection with the cryovac transaction except with respect to options that were still outstanding as of such date the adoption of sfas no 148 did not have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements 

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 

interpretation no 45 interpretation no 45 requires the disclosure of certain guarantees existing at december 31 2002 the company had no guarantees meeting the requirements of interpretation no 45 at december 31 2002 in addition interpretation no 45 requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the obligation of qualifying guarantee activities that are initiated or modified after december 31 2002 accordingly the company will apply the recognition provisions of interpretation no 45 prospectively to applicable guarantee activities initiated after december 31 2002 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation no 46 interpretation no 46 requires that the assets liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has the controlling financial interest interpretation no 46 also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to it interpretation no 46 will be effective for the company on february 1 2003 for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and on july 31 2003 for variable interest entities created prior to february 1 2003 based on its preliminary analysis of interpretation no 46 the company does not currently expect the adoption of interpretation no 46 to have a material impact on its 2003 consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the companys discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources actual results under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed may differ from estimates and any such differences may be material to the companys consolidated financial statements 

the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts — the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the companys customers deteriorates 

commitments and contingencies — litigation—on an ongoing basis the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against the company while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss if any can be made in assessing probable losses the company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries if any the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made 

impairment of longlived assets—the company periodically reviews longlived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 is reviewed 

for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses such as future cash flows and disposition costs may affect the carrying value of longlived assets and possible impairment expense in the companys consolidated financial statements  

selfinsurance — the company retains the obligation for certain claims and losses related to property casualty workers compensation and employee benefit claims the company accrues for outstanding reported claims claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon managements estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 

pensions — although the company maintains a noncontributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate the company does maintain defined benefit pension plans for certain of its us and nonus employees the company accounts for such pension plans in accordance with sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 87 under these accounting standards assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets certain of these assumptions include the discount rate used to measure future obligations the expected future rate of return on plan assets the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 87 

income taxes — the companys deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carryforwards the company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company estimates future taxable earnings with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could materially impact the companys consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments the company does not purchase hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rates 

from time to time the company may use interest rate swaps collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during september 2002 the company terminated certain interest rate swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the 875 senior notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately 2416000 such amount is being amortized and reflected as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the 875 senior notes at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had no interest rate swaps collars or options outstanding 

the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates generally the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise at december 31 2002 the carrying value of the companys total debt was 923434000 of which approximately 812569000 was fixed rate debt at december 31 2001 the carrying value of the companys total debt was 925602000 of which 782517000 was fixed rate debt the estimated fair value of the companys total debt which includes the cost of replacing the companys fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates was approximately 958256000 at december 31 2002 compared to 889434000 at december 31 2001 a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at december 31 2002 of approximately 25656000 such changes in the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt do not alter the companys obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt 

foreign exchange rates 

the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 

the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies the terms of such instruments are generally twelve months or less at december 31 2002 and 2001 the company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 146910000 and 266900000 respectively the estimated fair values of these contracts which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates were a net payable of approximately 32000 and a net receivable of approximately 313000 at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december 31 2002 would have caused the company to pay approximately 650000 to terminate these contracts 

the companys foreign subsidiaries had outstanding debt of approximately 322700000 and 321700000 at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively such debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities thereby reducing its need to enter into foreign exchange contracts 

commodities 

the company uses various commodity raw material and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing processes generally the company acquires such components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices as a result the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components
