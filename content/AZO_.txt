​ 

store operations

at august 27 2022 our stores were in the following locations

 ​ 

store formats 

substantially all stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 90 to 99 of each store’s square footage is selling space in our satellite stores approximately 40 to 50 of our space is dedicated to hard parts inventory while our hub stores and mega hubs have 70 to 85 of their space utilized for hard parts the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items

we believe our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training

we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting with related cascading meetings at our distribution centers regional offices and stores store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized computerbased training to support culture safety salesmanship compliance and product and job knowledge and several specialist vendor and thirdparty programs to support learning and development in areas requiring technical expertise and specific job knowledge all domestic autozoners are encouraged to complete our inhouse product knowledge program and parts expert certification which is developed in partnership with our key suppliers training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management store managers commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses 

store support centers 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales

​ 

store automation

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary pointofsale system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals our proprietary store management system provides administrative assistance as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the pointofsale system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions while the store management system provides simplified warranty and product return procedures 

commercial

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are a leading distributor of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the americas as part of our program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom or through the autozone pro smartphone application through our hub and mega hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts

store development

the following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years

 ​ 

 ​ 

we believe expansion opportunities exist in markets we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations for stores include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we seek to open new stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions

marketing and merchandising strategy

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are

customer service

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as identifying any associated warranties offered by us or our vendors we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business with next day or same day delivery programs in most of our us markets additionally we offer a smartphone application that provides customers with store locations driving directions operating hours product availability the ability to purchase products and other information

we also provide specialty tools through our suite of free services through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide free diagnostic and related services including check engine and antilock braking system light readings through our autozone fix finder service testing of starters alternators and batteries battery charging and the collection of used oil for recycling

merchandising

the following tables show some of the types of products we sell by major category of items

 ​ 

we believe customer satisfaction is often impacted by our ability to promptly provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire

pricing

we want to be the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes duralast and the family of duralast brands proelite shop pro surebilt totalpro trugrade and valucraft we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors

brand marketing marketing and loyalty

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize advertising direct marketing loyalty programs and promotions primarily to highlight our great value the availability of high quality parts and develop a relationship with an expanding base of customers broadcast and digital media are our primary advertising methods of driving retail traffic while we leverage a dedicated sales force and our provantage loyalty program to drive commercial sales 

store design visual merchandising and promotional execution 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves we utilize instore signage creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need

purchasing and supply chain

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil additionally we have an office in shanghai china to support our sourcing efforts in asia in fiscal 2022 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 13 percent of our total revenues and one vendor supplied approximately 8 percent of our total purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total revenues and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms the distribution centers replenish all stores up to multiple times per week depending on store sales volumes

we ended fiscal 2022 with 272 total domestic hub stores which have a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment

as a subset of our domestic hub stores we ended fiscal 2022 with 78 domestic mega hubs an increase of 20 since the end of fiscal 2021 mega hubs work in concert with our hubs to drive customer satisfaction through improved local parts availability and expanded product assortments a mega hub store carries inventory of 80000 to 110000 unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis currently we have over 6000 domestic stores with access to mega hub inventory a majority of these stores currently receive mega hub service same day

competition

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive due to numerous factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layouts location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks

government relations

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently changing and subject to varying interpretations these laws and regulations relate to among other things the marketing and sale of products proper handling and disposal of hazardous materials particularly in connection with our used oil oil filter and battery recycling programs occupational health and safety environmental matters labor and employment employee wages and benefits information security and data privacy real property financial reporting and disclosure antitrust and fair competition international trade and transportation logistics and delivery operations 

while compliance with the numerous laws and regulations applicable to our business including environmental regulations has not had a material adverse effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position to date we can make no assurances as to the future costs of compliance for more information see the risk factors titled “legal and regulatory risks” and “information technology cybersecurity and data privacy risks” 


 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results cash flows and stock price the following information should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make with the sec these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business

​ 

strategic and operational risks 

​ 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including

 

 ​ 

 these factors could result in a decline in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our business and overall financial condition

​ 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive see “item 1 business” above for additional information regarding our competitive environment

​ 

although we believe we compete effectively our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell merchandise at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories with deeper customer relationships more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising online and multichannel retailers often have lower operating costs and focus on delivery services thereby offering customers faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping in addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors which also puts pressure on our margins

​ 

consumers are embracing shopping online including through mobile applications with the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors’ increased focus on optimizing customers’ online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment product availability and feedback from other customers before purchasing products

​ 

if we are unable to continue to manage instock inventory and costs provide competitive delivery options develop successful competitive strategies including the maintenance of effective promotions advertising and loyalty programs develop and execute effective digital and omnichannel strategies or otherwise compete effectively or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline

​ 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

​ 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 6029 stores at august 26 2017 to 6943 stores at august 27 2022 a compounded annual growth rate of three percent additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 109 billion in fiscal 2017 to 163 billion in fiscal 2022 with a compounded annual growth rate of eight percent annual revenue growth is driven by increases in same store sales the opening of new stores and the development of new commercial programs see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of same store sales

​ 

we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by economic pressures

​ 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

​ 

although we are a leading distributor of automotive parts and other products in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers jobbers and online retailers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket participants have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited

​ 

our business depends upon hiring training and retaining qualified employees 

​ 

we believe much of our brand value lies in the quality of the approximately 112000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and alldata our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates and unemployment levels our business is also subject to employment laws and regulations including those related to minimum wage benefits and scheduling requirements in addition the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results 

we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly in a competitive labor market we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire train and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there are currently significant inflationary and other pressures on wages

in the us there has been an increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union both generally and in the retail industry although none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements there can be no assurance that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future if a significant portion of our work force were to become unionized our culture and operating model could be challenged by inserting a third party between our current terrific relationships between our leaders and hourly autozoners further our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other requirements and expectations that could change our company culture decrease our flexibility and disrupt our business further our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived by customers and autozoners and have adverse effects on our business and financial results 

if we are unable to hire properly train and retain qualified autozoners we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand or company culture which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages or benefit packages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment and labor laws including changes in existing employment benefit programs such as health insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

​ 

we are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices and payment terms if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations or our customers have a negative perception of our merchandise regarding quality innovation and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation result in costly product recalls and other liabilities and lead to reputational harm and loss of customer confidence to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise 

​ 

furthermore our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions which in turn impact our ability to source merchandise at competitive prices for example inflation rising interest rates and disruption to the global supply chain have negatively impacted costs and inventory availability and may continue to have a negative impact on future results and profitability credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could also have a material adverse effect on the ability of our global and domestic suppliers to finance and operate their businesses 

​ 

if we experience transitions with any of our significant vendors or if they experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales

​ 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business 

​ 

a disruption to our supply chain and distribution network could adversely affect our ability to receive and distribute inventory in a timely manner which could result in low inventory availability lost sales increased supply chain costs and loss of customer loyalty among other things such disruptions may result from damage or destruction of our distribution centers or may be the result of macroeconomic conditions impacting the broader supply chain industry at large for example in recent years ports rails and domestic longhauls in the us and elsewhere have been negatively impacted by capacity constraints congestion and delays periodic labor disputes security issues weatherrelated events and natural disasters which have been further exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic and other factors beyond our control our business and competitive position may be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully mitigate the impacts of such disruption to our supply chain or if we are unable to manage such disruptions more effectively than our competitors

​ 

risks associated with products sourced outside the us 

​ 

we directly imported approximately 15 of our purchases in fiscal 2022 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the price or flow of these goods for any reason such as civil unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes  economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties or tariffs merchandise quality or safety issues shipping and transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import often are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability in addition the foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we or our domestic vendors increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports will also increase

​ 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

​ 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably

in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and our logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve product availability and product assortment fulfill evolving consumer product demands and keep up with our longterm store expansion goals if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain initiatives including directly sourcing some products from outside the us do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our stores or increases in our operating costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins

​ 

our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets 

​ 

the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us in addition to the unique costs risks and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions

​ 

risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences potential changes to trade policies and trade agreements compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery and anticorruption laws greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy

​ 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance

​ 

business interruptions may negatively impact our operating hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

​ 

business interruptions including war or acts of terrorism political or civil unrest unusual or severe weather conditions including due to the impacts of climate change or otherwise such as hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes and floods public health crises and other disasters or the threat of any of them may negatively impact the hours and operations of our stores distribution centers store support centers or sourcing offices may negatively impact our supply chain and distribution network and may impede our ability to source quality merchandise domestically and outside of the us on favorable terms

​ 

in the event commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed we may have difficulty transporting merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers it is not possible to predict all events or circumstances which may negatively disrupt our business in a significant manner and the nearterm and longterm impacts of such disruptions on our business demand for our products and our growth initiatives will vary significantly based on the facts and circumstances of each such disruption furthermore such business interruptions could cause additional negative impacts of which we are not currently aware or magnify other risks associated with our business and operations

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability 

​ 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our autozone and private label brand names the value in our brand names and their continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth is dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness wow customer service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these or other areas involving our business including our response or lack thereof to external events involving civil unrest social justice and political issues whether or not based in fact could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly disseminated our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted if negative sentiment about the company whether or not based on fact is shared over social media

​ 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

​ 

information technology cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

​ 

‌ we rely heavily on information technology systems for our key business processes any damage to failure of or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

​ 

we rely extensively on information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to collect analyze process store manage transmit and protect key business processes transactions and data such as sales data customer data employee data demand forecasting merchandise ordering inventory replenishment supply chain management payment processing order fulfillment and more delays in the maintenance updates upgrading or patching of these systems applications or processes could adversely impact their effectiveness or could expose us to security and other risks our systems and the thirdparty systems with which we interact are subject to damage failure or interruption due to various reasons such as power or other critical infrastructure outages facility damage physical theft telecommunications failures malware security incidents malicious cyberattacks including the use of malicious codes worms phishing spyware denial of service attacks and ransomware natural disasters and catastrophic events inadequate or ineffective redundancy measures and design or usage errors by autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we seek to effectively maintain and safeguard our systems and our data and we seek to ensure our thirdparty service providers effectively maintain and safeguard their systems and our data such efforts are not always successful as a result we or our service providers could experience and on occasion have experienced one or more errors interruptions delays or cessations of service impacting the integrity or availability of our information technology infrastructure while such incidents have not been material to date any future incident could significantly disrupt our operations and key business processes result in the impairment or loss of critical data be costly and resourceintensive to remedy harm our reputation and relationship with customers autozoners vendors and other stakeholders and have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results

​ 

in addition our information technology systems infrastructure and personnel require substantial investments such as replacing existing systems some of which are older legacy systems that are less flexible and efficient with successor systems making changes to existing systems including the migration of applications to the cloud maintaining or enhancing legacy systems that are not currently being replaced or designing or costeffectively acquiring new systems with new functionality these efforts can result in significant potential risks including failure of the systems to operate as designed potential loss or corruption of data cost overruns or implementation delays or errors and may result in operational challenges security control failures reputational harm and increased costs that could adversely affect our business operations and results of operations

​ 

failure to maintain the security of sensitive personal information or other confidential information in our possession could subject us to litigation or regulatory enforcement action cause reputational harm and cause us to incur substantial costs or have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 

​ 

our business like that of most retailers involves the collection processing storage and transmission of personal information relating to our customers suppliers and autozoners and confidential business information relating to autozone or other parties with which we do business this information is handled by us as well as thirdparty service providers and vendors that provide us with various technology systems services and other resources that we use in connection with the handling of this information and in furtherance of our business objectives furthermore we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit debit electronic payments and gift cards which present information security risks and we may offer new payment options in the future presenting new risks of which we are currently unaware 

​ 

while addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving increasing in frequency and sophistication and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time there can be no assurance that the security measures we or our thirdparty service providers and vendors have in place today or introduce in the future in an effort to keep up with growing and evolving risks will prevent or mitigate the impact of a cyber incident or provide us with sufficient visibility to determine if a cyber incident has occurred failure to maintain the security of the personal and other confidential information to which we have access could lead to private litigation regulatory enforcement actions and reputational harm all of which would require extensive time and financial resources to resolve and could have a material adverse impact our business and financial condition 

​ 

while we have not experienced a material breach of our information systems or data to date unauthorized parties have in the past attempted and will continue to attempt to gain access to or disrupt the effectiveness of these systems and data as the result of a cyberattack employee misconduct employee error system compromises fraud hacking phishing attempts malware ransomware other malicious codes or other intentional or unintentional acts furthermore hardware software or other it applications that we or a third party develop for our use may contain exploitable vulnerabilities bugs or design defects or may involve other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security for example in connection with the covid19 pandemic public reports indicated there was a spike in cybersecurity attacks as shelterinplace orders and workfromhome measures led businesses to increase reliance on virtual environments and communications systems which had been the subject of increasing thirdparty vulnerabilities and security risks

​ 

the cost to remediate and respond to a cyber incident involving unauthorized use access damage or loss of systems data or other information could be significant to the extent any cyberattack or intrusion in our or one of our thirdparty service provider’s information systems results in the unauthorized access loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be required under federal and state privacy laws to notify impacted individuals and face substantial liability due to claims arising from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card issuers and others we maintain insurance coverage that may protect us from losses or claims in connection with certain incidents however our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover significant losses in any particular situation

​ 

we are subject to a complex and evolving body of laws and regulations regarding data privacy and may face increased costs as a result of changes in enforcement of or the adoption of new laws and regulations these costs may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations  

​ 

the regulatory environment related to information security data collection processing and use and data privacy is becoming increasingly rigorous and complex multiple states in the us have passed data protection laws designed to provide new rights to consumers and in some cases employees the potential effects of the various laws regulating the collection processing transfer and use of personal or protected information are farreaching and may require significant time resources and costs to comply may require changes to our existing practices and processes that are not advantageous to our business and otherwise limit our ability to use data to provide a more personalized customer experience or as otherwise desired in addition failure to comply with applicable requirements by us or our business partners or thirdparty service providers or vendors could subject us to fines sanctions governmental investigations lawsuits or reputational damage

​ 

additionally while we seek to comply with these various laws as they take effect many of the concepts are novel and rulemaking is not finalized given the short amount of time between finalized rulemaking and the dates these laws become effective and enforceable there can be no assurance that compliance efforts taken by us in good faith will be sufficient and we may be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action instituted by a state agency or other regulatory body

​ 

indebtedness financial and market risks 

we are selfinsured for certain costs associated with our operations and an increase in our insurance claims and expenses may have a material negative impact on us 

​ 

we are selfinsured up to certain limits for workers’ compensation employee group medical general liability product liability property and automobile the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements our reserves are established using historical trends and where appropriate using a thirdparty actuary to estimate costs to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported estimated costs are subject to a variety of assumptions and other factors including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors material increases in the number of insurance claims changes to healthcare costs accident frequency and severity legal expenses and other factors could result in unfavorable difference between actual selfinsurance costs and our reserve estimates as a result our selfinsurance costs could increase which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue debt securities 

​ 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions during the great recession resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that such similar events that occurred during the great recession will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm and longterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt

​ 

legal and regulatory risks 

​ 

our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws changes to existing laws increased enforcement activity or other governmental actions 

​ 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently revised and subject to varying interpretations these include laws governing employment and labor wage and hour environmental matters proper handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste healthcare data privacy cybersecurity the pricing and sale of goods import and export compliance transportation and logistics consumer protection and advertising among others these laws may differ substantially in the areas where we operate although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws there can be no certainty that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable laws if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to governmental enforcement action or private litigation resulting in monetary penalties reputational harm and increased costs of regulatory compliance any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation including tax legislation such as the inflation reduction act of 2022 could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies as a result of enforcing existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities which can occur in the ordinary course of business or may result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency or toward a particular industry

​ 

we may be adversely affected by legal regulatory or market responses to global climate change 

​ 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations for example we have significant operations in california where serious drought has made water less available and more costly and has increased the risk of wildfires changes in climate patterns leading to extreme heat waves or unusual cold weather at some of our locations can lead to increased energy usage and costs or otherwise adversely impact our facilities and operations and disrupt our supply chains and distribution systems growing concern over climate change has led policy makers in the us to consider the enactment of legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions such laws if enacted are likely to impact our business in a number of ways for example significant increases in fuel economy requirements new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or new federal or state incentive programs that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles annual miles driven or the products we sell we may not be able to accurately predict prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations with respect to electric vehicles and other technologies that minimize emissions compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to appropriately respond to such changes could adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our environmental social and governance esg goals 

​ 

increasing governmental and societal attention to esg matters including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting and disclosure topics such as climate change sustainability including with respect to our supply chain natural resources waste reduction energy human capital and risk oversight could expand the nature scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control assess and report we strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make progress in certain esg priority issue areas a failure or perceived failure to meet these expectations could adversely affect public perception of our business employee morale or customer or shareholder support

​ 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected by litigation 

​ 

we are involved in lawsuits regulatory investigations governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business such matters involve significant expense and divert management’s attention and resources from other matters the damages sought against us in these proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

general risks 

​ 

significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers moreover the us government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures civil unrest inflation rising interest rates foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant geopolitical conflicts proposed or additional tariffs continued volatility in energy prices the impact of a public health crisis or pandemic such as covid19 constraints on the global supply chain and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs it is unclear how such factors could impact our business in the short term over a longer period of time these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead these could adversely affect our financial condition and operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

we are the leading retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the americas we began operations in 1979 and at august 27 2022 operated 6168 stores in the us 703 stores in mexico and 72 stores in brazil each store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 27 2022 in 5342 of our domestic stores we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in all stores in mexico and brazil we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic repair and shop management software through wwwalldatacom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we also provide product information on our duralast branded products through wwwduralastpartscom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services

executive summary

for fiscal 2022 we achieved record net income of 24 billion an 119 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 16 billion an 111 increase over the prior year domestic commercial sales increased 265 which represents 288 of our domestic auto parts sales both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we made progress on our initiatives aimed at improving our ability to say “yes” to our customers more frequently and accelerating our commercial growth 

​ 

our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to inflation fuel costs wage rates supply chain disruptions hiring and other economic conditions given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

​ 

one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2022 was gas prices during fiscal 2022 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the us was 383 compared to 262 during fiscal 2021 we believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers’ level of disposable income with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 increase at the pump reduces approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods

​ 

we have also experienced continued accelerated pressure on wages in the us during fiscal 2022 some of this is attributed to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities while the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures and some specific actions taken recently by other retailers the regulatory changes are expected to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase employees’ wages substantially over the next few years

during fiscal 2022 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales categories continuing to comprise our largest set of categories while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years in our domestic stores we see a slight decrease in mix of sales of the discretionary category and a slight increase in the maintence category compared to last year

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road

​ 

miles driven

we believe as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including macroeconomic factors and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through july 2022 latest publicly available information miles driven in the us increased by 46 compared to the same period in the prior year we believe this increase is due to the nation returning to prepandemic levels but we are unable to predict if this increase will continue due to rising fuel prices general macroeconomic conditions or otherwise or the extent of the impact it will have on our business

seven year old or older vehicles

as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money additionally there is increased demand for used vehicles as a result of new vehicle inventory shortages 

we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating

according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2022 the average age of light vehicles on the road was 122 years and these vehicles account for more than 40 of us vehicles the average age of light vehicles has exceeded 11 years since 2012

​ 

fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2022 we reported net sales of 163 billion compared with 146 billion for the year ended august 28 2021 a 111 increase from fiscal 2021 this growth was driven primarily by a domestic same store sales increase of 84 and net sales of 2907 million from new stores domestic commercial sales increased 8850 million or 265 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2021

at august 27 2022 we operated 6168 domestic stores 703 in mexico and 72 in brazil compared with 6051 domestic stores 664 in mexico and 52 in brazil at august 28 2021 we reported a total auto parts segment domestic mexico and brazil sales increase of 110 for fiscal 2022

gross profit for fiscal 2022 was 85 billion or 521 of net sales a 62 basis point decrease compared with 77 billion or 528 of net sales for fiscal 2021 the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by the initiatives to accelerate growth in our commercial business

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 increased to 52 billion or 320 of net sales from 48 billion or 326 of net sales for fiscal 2021 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was driven by strong sales growth and a decrease in pandemic related expenses

interest expense net for fiscal 2022 was 1916 million compared with 1953 million during fiscal 2021 average borrowings for fiscal 2022 were 58 billion compared with 54 billion for fiscal 2021 weighted average borrowing rates were 329 and 328 for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively

our effective income tax rate was 211 of pretax income for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 the benefit of stock options exercised for fiscal 2022 was 632 million compared to 564 million for fiscal 2021 see “note d – income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements

fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020

a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 has been omitted from this annual report on form 10k but may be found in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended august 28 2021 filed with the sec on october 25 2021 which is available free of charge on the secs website at wwwsecgov and at wwwautozonecom by clicking “investor relations” located at the bottom of the page

quarterly periods

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2022 2021 and 2020 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of our annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 represented 329 of annual sales and 333 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 represented 336 of annual sales and 362 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 represented 360 of annual sales and 427 of net income

liquidity and capital resources

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories continued progress on our initiatives improved our operating performance for the fiscal year we believe that our cash generated from operating activities available cash reserves and available credit supplemented with our longterm borrowings will provide ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support longterm growth initiatives and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases as of august 27 2022 we held 2644 million of cash and cash equivalents as well as 22 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility without giving effect to commercial paper borrowings we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business repay our debt as it becomes due and fund our share repurchases over the shortterm and longterm in addition we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing if necessary 

net cash provided by operating activities was 32 billion in 2022 35 billion in 2021 and 27 billion in 2020 cash flows from operations are unfavorable compared to last year primarily due to higher inventory purchase volume

our net cash flows used in investing activities were 6481 million 6018 million and 4979 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures we invested 6724 million 6218 million and 4577 million in capital assets in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in capital expenditures from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by our growth initiatives including hub and mega hub expansion projects and new stores we had net new store openings of 176 218 and 138 for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable debt securities we purchased marketable debt securities of 560 million 637 million and 909 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively we had proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of 539 million 954 million and 842 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

net cash used in financing activities was 35 billion in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 and 6436 million in fiscal 2020 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 44 billion 34 billion and 9309 million for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations during the year ended august 27 2022 we repaid our 500 million 3700 senior notes due april 2022 and issued 750 million of new debt compared to none in 2021 and 1850 billion in 2020 in fiscal years 2022 and 2020 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes

the company had net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short term borrowing of 6034 million during fiscal 2022 we did not have any commercial paper or short term borrowing activity during fiscal 2021 and the company had net repayments of commercial paper and short term borrowings of 10 billion for 2020

during fiscal 2023 we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2022 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our supply chain initiatives which includes expanded hub and mega hubs as well as distribution center expansions and new stores the amount of investments in our new stores is impacted by different factors including whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment and whether such buildings are located in the us mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas

during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 our capital expenditures increased by approximately 8 and 36 and decreased 8 respectively fiscal 2021 capital expenditures increased due to delays in capital spending for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 related to covid19

​ 

in addition to building and land costs our new stores require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their autozone receivables allowing them to receive early payment from the financial institution on our invoices at a discounted rate the terms of these agreements are between the vendor and the financial institution upon request from the vendor we confirm to the vendor’s financial institution the balances owed to the vendor the due date and agree to waive any right of offset to the confirmed balances a downgrade in our credit or changes in the financial markets may limit the financial institutions’ willingness to participate in these arrangements which may result in the vendor wanting to renegotiate payment terms a reduction in payment terms would increase the working capital required to fund future inventory investments extended payment terms from our vendors have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1295 at august 27 2022 and 1296 at august 28 2021 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 27 2022 and august 29 2021 cash and cash equivalents of 868 million and 804 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support the liquidity needs in our foreign operations

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2022 our adjusted aftertax return on invested capital “roic” which is a nongaap measure was 529 as compared to 410 for the comparable prior year period adjusted roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases we use adjusted roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation

debt facilities

on november 15 2021 we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility the “revolving credit agreement” pursuant to which our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement was increased from 20 billion to 225 billion and the maximum borrowing under the revolving credit agreement may at our option subject to lenders approval be increased from 225 billion to 325 billion the revolving credit agreement will terminate and all amounts borrowed will be due and payable on november 15 2026 but we may make up to two requests to extend the termination date for an additional period of one year each revolving borrowings under the revolving credit agreement may be base rate loans eurodollar loans or a combination of both at our election the revolving credit agreement includes i a 75 million sublimit for swingline loans ii a 50 million individual issuer letter of credit sublimit and iii a 250 million aggregate sublimit for all letters of credit

under our revolving credit agreement covenants include restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances

as of august 27 2022 we had no outstanding borrowings and 18 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 251 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 27 2022 was 741

we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 25 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit agreement and had an expiration in june 2022 on may 16 2022 we amended and restated the letter of credit facility to among other things extend the facility through june 2025 as of august 27 2022 we had 236 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facility discussed above we had 1051 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 27 2022 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis

as of august 27 2022 our 6034 million of commercial paper borrowings the 300 million 2875 senior notes due january 2023 and the 500 million 3125 senior notes due july 2023 were classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the current ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility as of august 27 2022 we had 22 billion of availability under our revolving credit agreement without giving effect to commercial paper borrowings which would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with a longterm financing facility 

on january 18 2022 we repaid the 500 million 3700 senior notes due april 2022 which were callable at par in january 2022

on march 15 2021 we repaid the 250 million 2500 senior notes due april 2021 which were callable at par in march 2021

on august 1 2022 we issued 750 million in 4750 senior notes due august 2032 under our automatic shelf registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec on july 19 2022 file no 333266209 the “2022 shelf registration statement” the 2022 shelf registration statement allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store or distribution center openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes

on august 14 2020 we issued 600 million in 1650 senior notes due january 2031 under our automatic shelf registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec on april 4 2019 file no 333230719 the “2019 shelf registration statement” the 2019 shelf registration statement allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of the 500 million in 4000 senior notes due in november 2020 that were callable at par in august 2020 

on march 30 2020 we issued 500 million in 3625 senior notes due april 2025 and 750 million in 4000 senior notes due april 2030 under the 2019 shelf registration statement proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes

the senior notes contain a provision that repayment may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens sale and leaseback transactions and consolidations mergers and the sale of assets all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the applicable scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs interest is paid on a semiannual basis 

as of august 27 2022 we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2022 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 211 as compared to 201 as of 

the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt finance lease liabilities and rent times six and we calculate adjusted ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels

management expects the ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar to return to prepandemic levels in the future increasing debt levels once the target ratio is achieved to the extent adjusted ebitdar increases we expect our debt levels to increase conversely if adjusted ebitdar decreases we would expect our debt levels to decrease refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation

stock repurchases

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on march 23 2021 the board voted to increase the repurchase authorization from 247 to 262 billion the board voted to increase the repurchase authorization by 15 billion on october 5 2021 15 billion on december 15 2021 and 20 billion on march 22 2022 bringing the total authorization to 312 billion from january 1998 to august 27 2022 we have repurchased a total of 1525 million shares at an aggregate cost of 301 billion we repurchased 22 million 26 million and 826 thousand shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 44 billion 34 billion and 9309 million during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in purchases of treasury stock for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due to the temporary suspension of the share repurchase program during fiscal 2020 in order to preserve cash as a result of the uncertainty related to the pandemic purchases under the program resumed beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 27 2022 we had 11 billion remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock we will continue to evaluate current and expected business conditions and adjust the level of share repurchases under our share repurchase program as we deem appropriate

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2022 cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was 26 billion as compared to 30 billion during the comparable prior year period cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less net increases or decreases in debt excluding deferred financing costs plus share repurchases we use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available we believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation

on october 4 2022 the board voted to authorize the repurchase of an additional 25 billion of our common stock in connection with our ongoing share repurchase program since the inception of the repurchase program in 1998 the board has authorized 337 billion in share repurchases subsequent to august 27 2022 and through october 17 2022 we have repurchased 203856 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 4426 million considering the cumulative repurchases and the increase in authorization subsequent to august 27 2022 and through october 17 2022 we have 31 billion remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase its common stock

financial commitments

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 27 2022

 ​ 

 

our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 435 million at august 27 2022 approximately 33 million is classified as current liabilities and 402 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the longterm liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions 

​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements

a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers

there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

recent accounting pronouncements

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements

critical accounting policies and estimates

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management

selfinsurance reserves

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation general product liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2643 million at august 27 2022 and 2840 million at august 28 2021 where estimates are possible losses covered by insurance are recognized on a gross basis with a corresponding insurance receivable

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and use of a specialist to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends 

and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about healthcare costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 182 million for fiscal 2022 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date

if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 25 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 12 million for fiscal 2022 

income taxes

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions

we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 27 2022 we had approximately 435 million reserved for uncertain tax positions

we evaluate exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be affected

​ 

vendor allowances

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of the cost of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 86 of the vendor funds received during fiscal 2022 were recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and typically have a legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them we have had writeoffs less than 1 million in each of the last three years




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes

interest rate risk

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges as of august 27 2022 and august 28 2021 no such interest rate swaps were outstanding 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 59 billion as of august 27 2022 and 57 billion as of august 28 2021 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by 1828 million and greater than the carrying value of debt by 4131 million at august 27 2022 and august 28 2021 respectively which reflects its face amount adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts 

we had 6034 million in variable rate debt outstanding at august 27 2022 and none in august 28 2021 

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 55 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 313 million at august 27 2022 and 53 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 302 million at august 28 2021 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 2305 million at august 27 2022

foreign currency risk

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend 

exchange rates was 2702 million at august 27 2022 and 3101 million at august 28 2021 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased less than 10 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2022 and increased by approximately 10 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2021 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 27 2022 and august 28 2021 would have been approximately 246 million and approximately 282 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

store operations

at august 28 2021 our stores were in the following locations

 ​ 

store formats 

substantially all stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 90 to 99 of each store’s square footage is selling space in our satellite stores approximately 40 to 50 of our space is dedicated to hard parts inventory while our hub stores and mega hubs have 70 to 85 of their space utilized for hard parts the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items

we believe our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training

we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting with related cascading meetings at our distribution centers regional offices and stores store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized computerbased training to support culture safety salesmanship compliance and product and job knowledge and several specialist vendor and thirdparty programs to support learning and development in areas requiring technical expertise and specific job knowledge all domestic autozoners are encouraged to complete our inhouse product knowledge program and parts expert certification which is developed in partnership with our key suppliers training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management advanced leadership training is an additional area of investment that is used to deepen bench strength and support succession planning

store managers commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales

store automation

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary pointofsale system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals our proprietary store management system provides administrative assistance as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the pointofsale system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions while the store management system provides simplified warranty and product return procedures 

commercial

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are a leading distributor of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the americas as a part of the domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom or through the autozone pro smartphone application through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts

store development

the following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years

 ​ 

 ​ 

we believe expansion opportunities exist in markets we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations for stores include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we seek to open new stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions

marketing and merchandising strategy

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are

customer service

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as identifying any associated warranties offered by us or our vendors we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business with next day delivery covering approximately 82 of the us population additionally we offer a smartphone application that provides customers with store locations driving directions operating hours product availability the ability to purchase products and other information

we also provide specialty tools through our suite of free services through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide free diagnostic and related services including check engine light readings through our autozone fix finder service testing of starters alternators and batteries battery charging and the collection of used oil for recycling

merchandising

the following tables show some of the types of products we sell by major category of items

 ​ 

we believe customer satisfaction is often impacted by our ability to promptly provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire

pricing

we want to be the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes duralast and the family of duralast brands proelite shoppro surebilt trugrade and valucraft we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors

brand marketing marketing and loyalty

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize advertising direct marketing loyalty programs and promotions primarily to highlight our great value the availability of high quality parts and develop a relationship with an expanding base of customers broadcast and digital media are our primary advertising methods of driving retail traffic to our stores while we leverage a dedicated sales force and our provantage loyalty program to drive commercial sales

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil additionally we have an office in shanghai china to support our sourcing efforts in asia in fiscal 2021 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 13 percent of our total revenues and one vendor supplied approximately 10 percent of our total purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total revenues and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms the distribution centers replenish all stores up to multiple times per week depending on store sales volumes

we ended fiscal 2021 with 237 total domestic hub stores which have a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment

as a subset of our domestic hub stores we ended fiscal 2021 with 58 domestic mega hubs an increase of 14 since the end of fiscal 2020 mega hubs work in concert with our hubs to drive customer satisfaction through improved local parts availability and expanded product assortments a mega hub store carries inventory of 80000 to 110000 unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis currently we have over 5900 domestic stores with access to mega hub inventory a majority of these 5900 stores currently receive their service same day

competition

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive due to numerous factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layouts location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks

government relations

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently revised and subject to varying interpretations some of the more significant regulations include but are not limited to regulations governing the disposal of hazardous materials environmental regulations and occupational health and safety laws for example in connection with our used oil oil filter and battery recycling programs our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property and our employees must abide by appropriate policies and procedures to ensure the safe handling of these materials before a third party takes possession for recycling or disposal the terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations additionally as an owner or operator of real property we may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property 

while compliance with applicable laws and regulations including environmental regulations has not had a material adverse effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position to date we can make no assurances as to the future costs of compliance for more information see the risk factor titled “our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws changes to existing laws increased enforcement activity or other governmental actions” in “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report

seasonality

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september and the lowest sales in the months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term we believe the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the americas

item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results cash flows and stock price the following information should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make with the sec these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business

​ 

strategic and operational risks 

​ 

the covid19 pandemic persists in the us and many other parts of the world and may have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition liquidity and cash flow 

​ 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact numerous aspects of our business and the longterm impact to our business remains unknown this is due to the numerous uncertainties that have risen from the pandemic including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the likelihood of resurgences of the outbreak including due to the emergence and spread of variants actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease the timing distribution efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines and unintended consequences of the foregoing 

​ 

in particular it is unclear what nearterm and longterm impact these factors will have on the number of vehicle miles driven traffic to our stores as well as demand for our products from our retail and commercial customers while we have added safety measures to protect our employees and customers continued business disruption caused by covid19 may require further significant actions to mitigate the impact including but not limited to employee furloughs reductions in store hours and store closings as well as ongoing increases in expenses conversely if the unprecedented levels of customer demand we have experienced during the pandemic revert or subside we may be unable to reduce expenses or otherwise react quickly and effectively to such changes 

​ 

further the continuing pandemic and related economic uncertainty may result in prolonged disruption and volatility to our business cause additional negative impacts of which we are not currently aware and also magnify other risks associated with our business and operations including risks associated with sourcing quality merchandise domestically and outside the us our ability to promptly adjust inventory levels to meet fluctuations in customer demand our ability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations related to customers’ and autozoners’ health and safety our ability to open new store locations and expand or remodel existing stores and our ability to hire and train qualified employees to address temporary or sustained labor shortages accordingly the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products workforce availability and our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows

​ 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including

​ 

  

 ​ 

 ​ 

  

  

  

 ​ 

these factors could result in a decline in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our business and overall financial condition

​ 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing locations autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets

​ 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising online and multichannel retailers often focus on delivery services offering customers faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping some online businesses have lower operating costs than we do in addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors which also puts pressure on our margins

​ 

consumers are embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications with the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors’ increased focus on optimizing customers’ online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings

‌we believe that we compete effectively on the basis of merchandise availability as a result of investments in inventory available for immediate sale the development of a robust hub and mega hub distribution network providing efficient access to obtain products required ondemand options to order products online or by telephone and pick them up in stores and options for special orders directly from our vendors we also offer hasslefree returns to our customers in addition we believe that customers value the personal interaction with a salesperson who is qualified to offer trustworthy advice and provide other free services such as parts testing 

we also utilize promotions advertising and our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive marketplace if we are unable to continue to manage readilyavailable inventory demand and competitive delivery options as well as develop successful competitive strategies including the maintenance of effective promotions advertising and loyalty programs or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline

​ 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

​ 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 5814 stores at august 27 2016 to 6767 stores at august 28 2021 a compounded annual growth rate of three percent additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 10636 billion in fiscal 2016 to 14630 billion in fiscal 2021 with a compounded annual growth rate of seven percent annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores the development of new commercial programs and increases in same store sales see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of same store sales 

​ 

we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by economic pressures 

​ 

additionally the unprecedented levels of customer demand we have experienced for our products during the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant increases in same store sales growth during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 therefore we may not be able to sustain these growth trends if customer demand returns to prepandemic levels 

​ 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

​ 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket participants have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited

​ 

our business depends upon hiring training and retaining qualified employees 

​ 

we believe much of our brand value lies in the quality of the approximately 100000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and alldata our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates and unemployment levels our business is also subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage benefits and scheduling requirements in addition the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results 

we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly in a competitive labor market we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire train and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk of market increases in compensation 

if we are unable to hire properly train and retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand or company culture which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages or benefit packages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment and labor laws including changes in existing employment benefit programs such as health insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

​ 

we are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices and payment terms if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality innovation and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation result in costly product recalls and other liabilities and lead to reputational harm and loss of customer confidence to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise 

​ 

in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers furthermore our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions which in turn impact our ability to source merchandise at competitive prices for example the recent surges in consumer demand shortages of raw materials and disruption to the global supply chain have negatively impacted costs and inventory availability and may continue to have a negative impact on future results and profitability credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could also have a material adverse effect on the ability of our global and domestic suppliers to finance and operate their businesses 

​ 

if we experience transitions or changeover with any of our significant vendors or if they experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales

​ 

risks associated with products sourced outside the us 

​ 

we directly imported approximately 13 of our purchases in fiscal 2021 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the price or flow of these goods for any reason such as civil unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties or tariffs merchandise quality or safety issues shipping and transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import often are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability in addition the foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors such as the covid19 pandemic affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we or our domestic vendors increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports will also increase

 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

​ 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably

in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price and to meet consumer product needs if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain initiatives including directly sourcing some products from outside the us do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our stores or increases in our operating costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins

​ 

our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets 

​ 

the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us in addition to the unique costs risks and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions

​ 

risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences potential changes to trade policies and trade agreements compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery and anticorruption laws greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy

​ 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance

​ 

​ 

business interruptions may negatively impact our operating hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

​ 

war or acts of terrorism political or civil unrest unusual weather conditions including due to the impacts of climate change hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes and floods global health epidemics such as covid19 and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our stores distribution centers store support centers or sourcing offices being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the us and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected

in the event commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty transporting merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability 

​ 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these or other areas involving our business including our response or lack thereof to external events involving civil unrest social justice and political issues whether or not based in fact could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if customers have a bad experience and share it over social media

​ 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

​ 

cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

​ 

‌ we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

​ 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory communicate with customers process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage physical theft telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so

if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations

we are in the process of developing and implementing various information systems as well as modifying existing systems these technological changes will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays cost increases and other obstacles with these projects although we have invested significant resources during our planning project management and training implementation issues may arise which may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

failure to protect or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy and security of customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs 

​ 

our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales we consider information security to be a top priority and undertake cybersecurity planning and activities throughout the company senior management and the board of directors are actively engaged in cybersecurity risk management while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our systems these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error system compromises fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data we believe our preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks however our business or our third party providers with which we share sensitive information may not discover a security breach or loss of information for a significant period after the security breach occurs failure to effectively respond to system compromises may undermine our security measures the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity however our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes in particular in connection with the covid19 pandemic there has been a spike in cybersecurity attacks as shelter in place orders and work from home measures have led businesses to increase reliance on virtual environments and communications systems which have been subjected to increasing thirdparty vulnerabilities and security risks as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous and complex compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs there can be no assurance that our security measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident the cost to remediate damages to our systems suffered as a result of a cyberattack could be significant

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit debit electronic payments such as paypal apple pay etc and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and payment card industry data security standard even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future we maintain insurance coverage that may protect us from certain cyberattack claims however our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover significant losses in any particular situation

 

​ 

to the extent any cyberattack or intrusion in our or one of our thirdparty service provider’s information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us

​ 

we have invested in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans although these plans are in place we must provide ongoing monitoring and consistently revise our plans as technologies change rapidly and our efforts to overcome security risks continue to become increasingly more complex and concentrated

indebtedness financial and market risks 

we are selfinsured for certain costs associated with our operations and an increase in our insurance claims and expenses may have a material negative impact on us 

​ 

we are selfinsured up to certain limits for workers’ compensation employee group medical general liability product liability property and automobile the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements our reserves are established using historical trends and where appropriate using a third party actuary to estimate costs to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported estimated costs are subject to a variety of assumptions and other factors including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors material increases in the number of insurance claims changes to healthcare costs accident frequency and severity legal expenses and other factors could result in unfavorable difference between actual selfinsurance costs and our reserve estimates as a result our selfinsurance costs could increase which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue debt securities 

​ 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings

​ 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions during the great recession resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that such similar events that occurred during the great recession will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm and longterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt

​ 

​ 

legal and regulatory risks 

​ 

our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws changes to existing laws increased enforcement activity or other governmental actions 

​ 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently revised and subject to varying interpretations these include laws governing employment and labor wage and hour environmental matters proper handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste healthcare data privacy cybersecurity the pricing and sale of goods import and export compliance transportation and logistics consumer protection and advertising among others these laws may differ substantially in the areas where we operate although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws there can be no certainty that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable laws if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to governmental enforcement action or private litigation resulting in monetary penalties reputational harm and increased costs of regulatory compliance any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies as a result of enforcing existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities which can occur in the ordinary course of business or may result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency or toward a particular industry

​ 

we may be adversely affected by legal regulatory or market responses to global climate change 

​ 

growing concern over climate change has led policy makers in the us to consider the enactment of legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions such laws if enacted are likely to impact our business in a number of ways for example significant increases in fuel economy requirements new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or new federal or state incentive programs that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles annual miles driven or the products we sell we may not be able to accurately predict prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations with respect to electric vehicles and other technologies that minimize emissions compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers our inability to appropriately respond to such changes could adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected by litigation 

​ 

we are involved in lawsuits regulatory investigations governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business such matters involve significant expense and divert management’s attention and resources from other matters the damages sought against us in these proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

general risks 

​ 

significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the us was stagnated and unemployment was at historically high levels at the peak of the covid19 pandemic while the unemployment rate has improved the rate has not returned to prepandemic levels moreover the us government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures civil unrest inflation foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant geopolitical conflicts proposed or additional tariffs continued volatility in energy prices the impact of a public health crisis or pandemic such as covid19 constraints on the global supply chain and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs it is unclear how such factors could impact our business in the short term over a longer period of time these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead these could adversely affect our financial condition and operations

​ 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results cash flows and stock price the following information should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make with the sec these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business

​ 

strategic and operational risks 

​ 

the covid19 pandemic persists in the us and many other parts of the world and may have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition liquidity and cash flow 

​ 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact numerous aspects of our business and the longterm impact to our business remains unknown this is due to the numerous uncertainties that have risen from the pandemic including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the likelihood of resurgences of the outbreak including due to the emergence and spread of variants actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease the timing distribution efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines and unintended consequences of the foregoing 

​ 

in particular it is unclear what nearterm and longterm impact these factors will have on the number of vehicle miles driven traffic to our stores as well as demand for our products from our retail and commercial customers while we have added safety measures to protect our employees and customers continued business disruption caused by covid19 may require further significant actions to mitigate the impact including but not limited to employee furloughs reductions in store hours and store closings as well as ongoing increases in expenses conversely if the unprecedented levels of customer demand we have experienced during the pandemic revert or subside we may be unable to reduce expenses or otherwise react quickly and effectively to such changes 

​ 

further the continuing pandemic and related economic uncertainty may result in prolonged disruption and volatility to our business cause additional negative impacts of which we are not currently aware and also magnify other risks associated with our business and operations including risks associated with sourcing quality merchandise domestically and outside the us our ability to promptly adjust inventory levels to meet fluctuations in customer demand our ability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations related to customers’ and autozoners’ health and safety our ability to open new store locations and expand or remodel existing stores and our ability to hire and train qualified employees to address temporary or sustained labor shortages accordingly the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products workforce availability and our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows

​ 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including

​ 

  

 ​ 

 ​ 

  

  

  

 ​ 

these factors could result in a decline in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our business and overall financial condition

​ 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing locations autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets

​ 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising online and multichannel retailers often focus on delivery services offering customers faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping some online businesses have lower operating costs than we do in addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors which also puts pressure on our margins

​ 

consumers are embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications with the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors’ increased focus on optimizing customers’ online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings

‌we believe that we compete effectively on the basis of merchandise availability as a result of investments in inventory available for immediate sale the development of a robust hub and mega hub distribution network providing efficient access to obtain products required ondemand options to order products online or by telephone and pick them up in stores and options for special orders directly from our vendors we also offer hasslefree returns to our customers in addition we believe that customers value the personal interaction with a salesperson who is qualified to offer trustworthy advice and provide other free services such as parts testing 

we also utilize promotions advertising and our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive marketplace if we are unable to continue to manage readilyavailable inventory demand and competitive delivery options as well as develop successful competitive strategies including the maintenance of effective promotions advertising and loyalty programs or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline

​ 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

​ 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 5814 stores at august 27 2016 to 6767 stores at august 28 2021 a compounded annual growth rate of three percent additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 10636 billion in fiscal 2016 to 14630 billion in fiscal 2021 with a compounded annual growth rate of seven percent annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores the development of new commercial programs and increases in same store sales see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of same store sales 

​ 

we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by economic pressures 

​ 

additionally the unprecedented levels of customer demand we have experienced for our products during the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant increases in same store sales growth during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 therefore we may not be able to sustain these growth trends if customer demand returns to prepandemic levels 

​ 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

​ 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket participants have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited

​ 

our business depends upon hiring training and retaining qualified employees 

​ 

we believe much of our brand value lies in the quality of the approximately 100000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and alldata our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates and unemployment levels our business is also subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage benefits and scheduling requirements in addition the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results 

we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions and these positions have historically had high turnover rates which can lead to increased training and retention costs particularly in a competitive labor market we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire train and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk of market increases in compensation 

if we are unable to hire properly train and retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand or company culture which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages or benefit packages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment and labor laws including changes in existing employment benefit programs such as health insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

​ 

we are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices and payment terms if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality innovation and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation result in costly product recalls and other liabilities and lead to reputational harm and loss of customer confidence to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise 

​ 

in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers furthermore our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions which in turn impact our ability to source merchandise at competitive prices for example the recent surges in consumer demand shortages of raw materials and disruption to the global supply chain have negatively impacted costs and inventory availability and may continue to have a negative impact on future results and profitability credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could also have a material adverse effect on the ability of our global and domestic suppliers to finance and operate their businesses 

​ 

if we experience transitions or changeover with any of our significant vendors or if they experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales

​ 

risks associated with products sourced outside the us 

​ 

we directly imported approximately 13 of our purchases in fiscal 2021 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the price or flow of these goods for any reason such as civil unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties or tariffs merchandise quality or safety issues shipping and transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import often are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability in addition the foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors such as the covid19 pandemic affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we or our domestic vendors increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports will also increase

 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

​ 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably

in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price and to meet consumer product needs if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain initiatives including directly sourcing some products from outside the us do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our stores or increases in our operating costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins

​ 

our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets 

​ 

the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us in addition to the unique costs risks and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions

​ 

risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences potential changes to trade policies and trade agreements compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery and anticorruption laws greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy

​ 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance

​ 

​ 

business interruptions may negatively impact our operating hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

​ 

war or acts of terrorism political or civil unrest unusual weather conditions including due to the impacts of climate change hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes and floods global health epidemics such as covid19 and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our stores distribution centers store support centers or sourcing offices being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the us and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected

in the event commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty transporting merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability 

​ 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these or other areas involving our business including our response or lack thereof to external events involving civil unrest social justice and political issues whether or not based in fact could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if customers have a bad experience and share it over social media

​ 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

​ 

cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

​ 

‌ we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

​ 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory communicate with customers process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage physical theft telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so

if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations

we are in the process of developing and implementing various information systems as well as modifying existing systems these technological changes will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays cost increases and other obstacles with these projects although we have invested significant resources during our planning project management and training implementation issues may arise which may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

failure to protect or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy and security of customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs 

​ 

our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales we consider information security to be a top priority and undertake cybersecurity planning and activities throughout the company senior management and the board of directors are actively engaged in cybersecurity risk management while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our systems these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error system compromises fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data we believe our preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks however our business or our third party providers with which we share sensitive information may not discover a security breach or loss of information for a significant period after the security breach occurs failure to effectively respond to system compromises may undermine our security measures the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity however our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes in particular in connection with the covid19 pandemic there has been a spike in cybersecurity attacks as shelter in place orders and work from home measures have led businesses to increase reliance on virtual environments and communications systems which have been subjected to increasing thirdparty vulnerabilities and security risks as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous and complex compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs there can be no assurance that our security measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident the cost to remediate damages to our systems suffered as a result of a cyberattack could be significant

​ 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit debit electronic payments such as paypal apple pay etc and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and payment card industry data security standard even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future we maintain insurance coverage that may protect us from certain cyberattack claims however our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover significant losses in any particular situation

 

​ 

to the extent any cyberattack or intrusion in our or one of our thirdparty service provider’s information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we restarted our share repurchases under our share repurchase program which had been temporarily suspended during fiscal 2020 in response to the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic we will continue to evaluate current and expected business conditions and adjust the level of share repurchases under our share repurchase program as we deem appropriate

covid19 impact 

​ 

covid19 continues to impact numerous aspects of our business our sales remain at record levels as we have experienced unprecedented customer demand for our products during the covid19 pandemic as we believe that many of our customers have benefitted from pandemicrelated government stimulus and benefits our main priority continues to be the health safety and wellbeing of our customers and autozoners we continue to invest in supplies for the protection of our employees and customers and increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting our stores for fiscal 2021 we incurred approximately 430 million in pandemic related expenses including emergency timeoff benefit enhancements for both fulltime and parttime employees as compared to approximately 839 million in the comparable prior year period

​ 

the longterm impact to our business remains unknown as we are unable to accurately predict the impact that covid19 will have due to numerous uncertainties including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the likelihood of additional variants and resurgences of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease the timing distribution efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines and unintended consequences of the foregoing furthermore the continuing pandemic and related economic uncertainty may result in prolonged disruption and volatility to our business and magnify certain risks including risks associated with sourcing quality merchandise domestically and outside the us our ability to promptly adjust inventory levels to meet fluctuations in customer demand our ability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations related to customers’ and autozoners’ health and safety our ability to open new store locations and expand or remodel existing stores and our ability to hire and train qualified employees to address temporary or sustained labor shortages 

​ 

executive summary

for fiscal 2021 we achieved record net income of 2170 billion a 252 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 1998 billion a 158 increase over the prior year domestic commercial sales increased 226 which represents approximately 23 of our total sales both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we continue to experience unprecedented demand for our products during the covid19 pandemic and make progress on our initiatives aimed at improving our ability to say “yes” to our customers more frequently drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial growth 

​ 

our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs wage rates supply chain disruptions hiring and other economic conditions including for fiscal 2021 and 2020 the effects of and responses to covid19 given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

​ 

one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2021 was gas prices during fiscal 2021 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the us was 262 compared to 232 during fiscal 2020 we believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers’ level of disposable income with approximately 10 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 10 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods

​ 

we have also experienced continued accelerated pressure on wages in the us during fiscal 2021 some of this is attributed to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities while the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures and some specific actions taken recently by other retailers the regulatory changes are expected to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase employees’ wages substantially over the next few years but we are still assessing to what degree these changes will impact our earnings growth in future periods

during fiscal 2021 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 83 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to comprise our largest set of categories while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years in our domestic stores we continue to see a slight increase in mix of sales of the discretionary category as compared to last year we believe the improvement in this sales category resulted from the pandemic as many of our customers continue to have more time to work on discretionary projects 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road

miles driven

we believe as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including macroeconomic factors and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through july 2021 latest publicly available information miles driven in the us decreased by 52 compared to the same period in the prior year we believe this decrease is a result of the pandemic but we are unable to predict if this decline will continue and are uncertain of the impact it will have to our business

seven year old or older vehicles

according to the latest data provided by the us bureau of economic analysis new light vehicle sales for the year ended august 2021 increased 115 as compared to the comparable prior year period we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating

according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2021 the average age of light vehicles on the road was 121 years the average age of light vehicles has exceeded 11 years since 2012

we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money additionally there is increased demand for used vehicles as a result of new vehicle inventory shortages during the covid19 pandemic as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell

fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020

for the fiscal year ended august 28 2021 we reported net sales of 14630 billion compared with 12632 billion for the year ended august 29 2020 a 158 increase from fiscal 2020 this growth was driven primarily by a domestic same store sales increase of 136 and net sales of 2158 million from new stores domestic commercial sales increased 6177 million or 226 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2020

at august 28 2021 we operated 6051 domestic stores 664 in mexico and 52 in brazil compared with 5885 domestic stores 621 in mexico and 43 in brazil at august 29 2020 we reported a total auto parts segment domestic mexico and brazil sales increase of 159 for fiscal 2021

gross profit for fiscal 2021 was 7718 billion or 528 of net sales an 85 basis point decrease compared with 6771 billion or 536 of net sales for fiscal 2020 the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by the initiatives to accelerate growth in our commercial business

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 increased to 4773 billion or 326 of net sales from 4353 billion or 345 of net sales for fiscal 2020 the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was driven by strong sales growth and a decrease in pandemic related expenses

interest expense net for fiscal 2021 was 1953 million compared with 2012 million during fiscal 2020 average borrowings for fiscal 2021 were 5401 billion compared with 5393 billion for fiscal 2020 weighted average borrowing rates were 328 and 326 for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively

our effective income tax rate was 211 of pretax income for fiscal 2021 compared to 218 for fiscal 2020 the decrease in the tax rate was primarily attributable to an increased benefit from stock options exercised during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 the benefit of stock options exercised for fiscal 2021 was 564 million compared to 209 million for fiscal 2020 see “note d – income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

net income for fiscal 2021 increased by 252 to 2170 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 323 to 9519 from 7193 in fiscal 2020 the impact on the fiscal 2021 diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases was an increase of 513

fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019

a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 has been omitted from this annual report on form 10k but may be found in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended august 29 2020 filed with the sec on october 26 2020 which is available free of charge on the secs website at wwwsecgov and at wwwautozonecom by clicking “investor relations” located at the bottom of the page

quarterly periods

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2021 and 2020 and 17 weeks in 2019 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of our annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 represented 336 of annual sales and 362 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 represented 360 of annual sales and 427 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 represented 336 of annual sales and 350 of net income

liquidity and capital resources

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories unprecedented customer demand from the impact of the covid19 pandemic and continued progress on our initiatives improved our operating performance for the fiscal year which drove a substantial increase in cash flows from operations we believe that our cash generated from operating activities available cash reserves and available credit supplemented with our longterm borrowings will provide ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support longterm growth initiatives and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases as of august 28 2021 we held 1171 billion of cash and cash equivalents as well as 1998 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business repay our debt as it becomes due and fund our share repurchases over the shortterm and longterm in addition we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing if necessary 

net cash provided by operating activities was 3519 billion in 2021 2720 billion in 2020 and 2129 billion in 2019 cash flows from operations are favorable compared to last year primarily due to favorable changes in accounts payable driven by higher sustained inventory purchase volume in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 and growth in net income due to accelerated sales growth as a result of the pandemic

our net cash flows used in investing activities were 6018 million in fiscal 2021 4979 million in fiscal 2020 and 4918 million in fiscal 2019 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due to an increase in capital expenditures we invested 6218 million in capital assets in fiscal 2021 4577 million in fiscal 2020 and 4961 million in fiscal 2019 the increase in capital expenditures from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by increased store openings we had 218 net new store openings for fiscal 2021 138 for fiscal 2020 and 209 for fiscal 2019 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable debt securities we purchased 637 million in marketable debt securities in fiscal 2021 909 million in fiscal 2020 and 555 million in fiscal 2019 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of 954 million in fiscal 2021 842 million in fiscal 2020 and 531 million in fiscal 2019

net cash used in financing activities was 35 billion in fiscal 2021 6436 million in fiscal 2020 and 1674 billion in fiscal 2019 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 3378 billion for fiscal 2021 9309 million for fiscal 2020 and 2005 billion for fiscal 2019 the increase in purchases of treasury stock for fiscal 2021 in comparison to fiscal 2020 was due to resuming our share repurchase program which was temporarily suspended in fiscal 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations during the year ended august 28 2021 we repaid our 250 million 2500 senior notes due april 2021 which were callable at par in march 2021 we did not issue any new debt in fiscal 2021 and issued 1850 billion and 750 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively in fiscal 2020 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes repayment of our outstanding commercial paper and repayment of our 500 million senior notes due in november 2020 which were callable at par in august 2020 in fiscal 2019 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings our 250 million senior notes due in april 2019 and for general corporate purposes 

we did not have any commercial paper or short term borrowing activity during fiscal 2021 net repayments of commercial paper and short term borrowings were 1030 billion and 2953 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively

during fiscal 2022 we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2021 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to expansion of our store base and supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and mexico businesses which includes new stores including mega hubs as well as distribution center expansions and remodels the amount of investments in our new stores is impacted by different factors including whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment and whether such buildings are located in the us mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas 

during fiscal 2021 our capital expenditures increased by approximately 36 compared to a decrease of 8 and 5 for fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively fiscal 2021 capital expenditures increased significantly due to delays in capital spending for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 related to covid19

in addition to building and land costs our new stores require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their autozone receivables allowing them to receive early payment from the financial institution on our invoices at a discounted rate the terms of these agreements are between the vendor and the financial institution upon request from the vendor we confirm to the vendor’s financial institution the balances owed to the vendor the due date and agree to waive any right of offset to the confirmed balances a downgrade in our credit or changes in the financial markets may limit the financial institutions’ willingness to participate in these arrangements which may result in the vendor wanting to renegotiate payment terms a reduction in payment terms would increase the working capital required to fund future inventory investments extended payment terms from our vendors have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1296 at august 28 2021 and 1153 at august 29 2020 the increase from fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increased accounts payable purchases with favorable vendor terms and higher inventory turns

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 28 2021 and august 29 2020 cash and cash equivalents of 804 million and 624 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support the liquidity needs in our foreign operations

for the fiscal year ended august 28 2021 our adjusted aftertax return on invested capital “roic” which is a nongaap measure was 410 as compared to 357 for the comparable prior year period adjusted roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases we use adjusted roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation

debt facilities

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facility discussed above we had 1368 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 28 2021 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis

for the fiscal year ended august 28 2021 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 201 as compared to 241 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt finance lease liabilities and rent times six and we calculate adjusted ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels

management expects the ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar to return to prepandemic levels in the future increasing debt levels once the target ratio is achieved to the extent adjusted ebitdar increases we expect our debt levels to increase conversely if adjusted ebitdar decreases we would expect our debt levels to decrease refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation

stock repurchases

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on december 15 2020 the board voted to increase the authorization by 15 billion on march 23 2021 the board voted to increase the repurchase authorization by an additional 15 billion which raised the total value of shares authorized to be repurchased to 2615 billion from january 1998 to august 28 2021 we have repurchased a total of 1503 million shares at an aggregate cost of 25732 billion we repurchased 26 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 3378 billion during fiscal 2021 826 thousand shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 9309 million during fiscal 2020 and 22 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2005 billion during fiscal 2019 the increase in purchases of treasury stock for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due to the temporary suspension of the share repurchase program during fiscal 2020 in order to preserve cash as a result of the uncertainty related to the pandemic purchases under the program resumed beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 28 2021 we had 4176 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock we will continue to evaluate current and expected business conditions and adjust the level of share repurchases under our share repurchase program as we deem appropriate

for the fiscal year ended august 28 2021 cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was 3049 billion as compared to 2185 billion during the comparable prior year period cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less net increases or decreases in debt excluding deferred financing costs plus share repurchases we use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available we believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation

on october 5 2021 the board voted to authorize the repurchase of an additional 15 billion of our common stock in connection with our ongoing share repurchase program since the inception of the repurchase program in 1998 the board has authorized 2765 billion in share repurchases subsequent to august 28 2021 and through october 18 2021 we have repurchased 220022 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 3628 million considering the cumulative repurchases and the increase in authorization subsequent to august 28 2021 and through october 18 2021 we have 1555 billion remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase its common stock

financial commitments

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 28 2021

 ​ 

 

our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 318 million at august 28 2021 approximately 30 million is classified as current liabilities and 288 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the longterm liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions

​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements

 ​ 

a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers

there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures

“management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

recent accounting pronouncements

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements

critical accounting policies and estimates

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management

selfinsurance reserves

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation general product liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2840 million at august 28 2021 and 2886 million at august 29 2020 where estimates are possible losses covered by insurance are recognized on a gross basis with a corresponding insurance receivable

​ 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and use of a specialist to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about healthcare costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 191 million for fiscal 2021 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date

if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 25 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 14 million for fiscal 2021 

income taxes

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions

we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 28 2021 we had approximately 318 million reserved for uncertain tax positions

we evaluate exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected

vendor allowances

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of the cost of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 85 of the vendor funds received during fiscal 2021 were recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and typically have a legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 1 million in each of the last three years




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes

interest rate risk

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges as of august 28 2021 and august 29 2020 no such interest rate swaps were outstanding 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 5683 billion as of august 28 2021 and 6081 billion as of august 29 2020 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 4131 million and 5675 million at august 28 2021 and august 29 2020 respectively which reflects its face amount adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts 

we had no variable rate debt outstanding at august 28 2021 and august 29 2020 

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 5270 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 302 million at august 28 2021 and 5513 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 366 million at august 29 2020 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 2583 million at august 28 2021

foreign currency risk

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 3101 million at august 28 2021 and 2931 million at august 29 2020 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso increased by approximately 10 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2021 and decreased by approximately 10 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2020 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 28 2021 and august 29 2020 would have been approximately 282 million and approximately 266 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

‌ ​ 

at august 29 2020 our stores were in the following locations

 ​ 

‌ ​ 

marketing and merchandising strategy

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are

customer service

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as identifying any associated warranties that are offered by us or our vendors we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business with next day delivery covering approximately 80 of the us population additionally we offer a smartphone application that provides customers with store locations driving directions operating hours product availability and the ability to purchase products

we also provide specialty tools through our suite of free services through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide free diagnostic and related services including check engine light readings through our autozone fix finder service testing of starters alternators and batteries battery charging and the collection of used oil for recycling

merchandising

the following tables show some of the types of products we sell by major category of items

 ​ 

we believe that customer satisfaction is often impacted by our ability to promptly provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire

‌ ​ 

pricing

we want to be the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes duralast and the family of duralast brands proelite shoppro surebilt trugrade and valucraft we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors

brand marketing marketing and loyalty

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize advertising direct marketing loyalty programs and promotions primarily to highlight our great value the availability of high quality parts and develop a relationship with an expanding base of customers broadcast and digital media are our primary advertising methods of driving retail traffic to our stores while we leverage a dedicated sales force and our provantage loyalty program to drive commercial sales 

store design visual merchandising and promotional execution 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves we utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need

commercial

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are a leading distributor of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the americas as a part of the domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts

store operations

store formats

substantially all stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 90 to 99 of each store’s square footage is selling space in our satellite stores approximately 40 to 50 of our space is dedicated to hard parts inventory while our hub stores and mega hubs have 70 to 85 of their space utilized for hard parts the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking

‌ ​ 

store personnel and training

we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting with related cascading meetings at our distribution centers regional offices and stores store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized computerbased training to support culture safety salesmanship compliance and product and job knowledge and several specialist vendor and thirdparty programs to support learning and development in areas requiring technical expertise and specific job knowledge all domestic autozoners are encouraged to complete our inhouse product knowledge program and parts expert certification which is developed in partnership with our key suppliers training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management advanced leadership training is an additional area of investment that is used to deepen bench strength and support succession planning

store managers commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales

store automation

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary pointofsale system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals our proprietary store management system provides administrative assistance as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the pointofsale system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions while the store management system provides simplified warranty and product return procedures

store development

the following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years

 ​ 

 ​ 

‌ ​ 

we believe expansion opportunities exist in markets we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations for stores include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we seek to open new stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions

purchasing and supply chain

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil additionally we have an office in shanghai china to support our sourcing efforts in asia in fiscal 2020 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 12 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied approximately 12 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms the distribution centers replenish all stores up to multiple times per week depending on store sales volumes

we ended fiscal 2020 with 224 total domestic hub stores which have a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment

as a subset of our domestic hub stores we ended fiscal 2020 with 44 domestic mega hubs an increase of 9 since the end of fiscal 2019 mega hubs work in concert with our hubs to drive customer satisfaction through improved local parts availability and expanded product assortments a mega hub store carries inventory of 70000 to 110000 unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis currently we have over 5700 domestic stores with access to mega hub inventory a majority of these 5700 stores currently receive their service same day

competition

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive due to numerous factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layouts location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks

‌ ​ 

trademarks and patents

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” “autozone rewards” “get in the zone” “parts are just part of what we do” “provantage” “the best parts in auto parts” “zone” and trademarks “alldata collision” “alldata manage” “alldata mobile” “alldata repair” “alldata techassist” “autozone” “autozone  design” “duralast” “duralast aero blade” “duralast flex blade” “duralast gold” “duralast gold cmax” “duralast gt” “duralast platinum” “duralast propower” “duralast propower plus” “duralast propower ultra” “duralast propower agm” “duralast max” “econocraft” “loanatool” “proelite” “proelite  design” “surebilt” “trugrade” “valucraft” “v  design” and “znet” we believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing and merchandising strategies

employees

as of august 29 2020 we employed approximately 100000 persons approximately 60 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 91 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 6 percent in distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support and other functions included in the above numbers are approximately 10000 persons employed in our mexico and brazil operations

we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our autozoners are good

seasonality

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 10 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term we believe the effects of weather balance out as we have locations throughout the americas

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results cash flows and stock price the following information should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make with the sec these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business

the ongoing outbreak of covid19 has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization continues to spread within the united states and many other parts of the world and may have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition liquidity and cash flow 

as the outbreak of covid19 continues to grow both in the us and globally there has been significant volatility in financial market indices and the adoption of emergency legislation aimed to address the negative impacts of the pandemic while sales were initially negatively impacted and we have incurred significant expenses following the us federal government stimulus our sales rebounded reaching record levels we are unable to accurately predict the impact that covid19 will have on our business and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the likelihood of a resurgence of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease and unintended consequences of the foregoing in particular it is unclear what nearterm and longterm impact these factors will have on the number of vehicle miles driven traffic to our stores as well as demand for our products from our retail and commercial customers continued business disruption caused by covid19 may require significant actions to mitigate the impact including but not limited to employee furloughs reductions in store hours and store closings as well as ongoing increases in expenses further the continuing pandemic and related economic uncertainty may result in prolonged disruption to our business additional negative impacts of which we are not currently aware and may also magnify other risks associated with our business and operations including risks associated with sourcing quality merchandise domestically and outside the us our ability to promptly adjust inventory levels to meet fluctuations in customer demand our ability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations related to customers’ and autozoners’ health and safety our ability to open new store locations and expand or remodel existing stores and our ability to hire and train qualified employees to address temporary or sustained labor shortages accordingly the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products workforce availability and our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows

​ 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including 

 

 ​ 

 

  

‌ ​ 

  

  

  

  

  

 ​ 

these factors could result in a decline in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our business and overall financial condition 

​ 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing locations autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising online and multichannel retailers often focus on delivery services offering customers faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping some online businesses have lower operating costs than we do in addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors which also puts pressure on our margins 

consumers are embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications with the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors’ increased focus on optimizing customers’ online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings 

‌ ​ 

we believe that we compete effectively on the basis of merchandise availability as a result of investments in inventory available for immediate sale the development of a robust hub and mega hub distribution network providing efficient access to obtain products required ondemand options to order products online or by telephone and pick them up in stores and options for special orders directly from our vendors we also offer hasslefree returns to our customers in addition we believe that customers value the personal interaction with a salesperson that is qualified to offer trustworthy advice and provide other free services such as parts testing 

​ 

we also utilize promotions advertising and our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive marketplace if we are unable to continue to manage readilyavailable inventory demand and competitive delivery options as well as develop successful competitive strategies including the maintenance of effective promotions advertising and loyalty programs or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

​ 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

​ 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 5609 stores at august 29 2015 to 6549 stores at august 29 2020 an average store increase per year of three percent additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 10187 billion in fiscal 2015 to 12632 billion in fiscal 2020 an average increase per year of five percent annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores the development of new commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by economic pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales 

​ 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

historically some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment 

 

these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could achieve greater market penetration could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business 

​ 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket participants have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

​ 

​ 

​ 

​ 

​ 

‌ ​ 

our business depends upon hiring training and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the approximately 100000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and alldata our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage benefits and scheduling requirements in addition the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire train and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk of market increases in compensation 

​ 

if we are unable to hire properly train and retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales regulatory noncompliance losses of customers and diminution of our brand or company culture which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages or benefit packages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment and labor laws including changes in existing employment benefit programs such as health insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

​ 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

​ 

we are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices and payment terms if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions including disruption to the global supply chain could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses resulting in increased product costs and difficulties in meeting our inventory demands if we experience transitions or changeover with any of our significant vendors or if they experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

​ 

​ 

‌ ​ 

risks associated with products sourced outside the us 

we directly imported approximately 13 of our purchases in fiscal 2020 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the price or flow of these goods for any reason such as civil unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties or tariffs merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import often are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability in addition the foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors such as the covid19 pandemic affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we or our domestic vendors increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports will also increase 

 

our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new locations into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price and to meet consumer product needs if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain initiatives including directly sourcing some products from outside the us do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increases in our operating costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if customers have a bad experience and share it over social media 

‌ ​ 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations the inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

 

our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets 

​ 

the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us in addition to the unique costs risks and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions 

​ 

risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences potential changes to trade policies and trade agreements compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery and anticorruption laws greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy 

​ 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance

failure to protect or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy and security of customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs 

​ 

our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers’ suppliers’ employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales we consider information security to be a top priority and undertake cybersecurity planning and activities throughout the company senior management and the board of directors are actively engaged in cybersecurity risk management while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our systems these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error system compromises fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data we believe that our preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks however our business or our third party providers with which we share sensitive information may not discover a security breach or loss of information for a significant period after the security breach occurs failure to effectively respond to system compromises may undermine our security measures the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity however our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs there can be no assurance that our security measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident the cost to remediate damages to our systems suffered as a result of a cyberattack could be significant 

​ 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit debit electronic payments such as paypal apple pay etc and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and payment card industry data security standard even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future we maintain insurance coverage that may protect us from certain cyberattack claims however our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover significant losses in any particular situation

 

to the extent that any cyberattack or intrusion in our or one of our thirdparty service provider’s information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

​ 

we have invested in informationtechnology risk management and disaster recovery plans although these plans are in place we must provide ongoing monitoring and consistently revise our plans as technologies change rapidly and our efforts to overcome security risks continue to become increasingly more complex and concentrated 

​ 

‌ ​ 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

​ 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory communicate with customers process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage physical theft telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so 

if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we are in the process of developing and implementing various information systems as well as modifying existing systems these technological changes will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays costs increases and other obstacles with these projects although we have invested significant resources during our planning project management and training implementation issues may arise which may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political or civil unrest unusual weather conditions hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes floods global health epidemics such as covid19 and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the us and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty transporting merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers 

we are selfinsured for certain costs associated with our operations and an increase in our insurance claims and expenses may have a material negative impact on us 

we are selfinsured up to certain limits for workers’ compensation employee group medical general liability product liability property and automobile the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements our reserves are established using historical trends and where appropriate using a third party actuary to estimate costs to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported estimated costs are subject to a variety of assumptions and other factors including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors material increases in the number of insurance claims changes to healthcare costs accident frequency and severity legal expenses and other factors could result in unfavorable difference between actual selfinsurance costs and our reserve estimates as a result our selfinsurance costs could increase which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

‌ ​ 

general risk factors 

​ 

a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue debt securities 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

​ 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions during the great recession resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms we can provide no assurance that such similar events that occurred during the great recession will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm and longterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

​ 

our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws changes to existing laws increased enforcement activity or other governmental actions 

​ 

we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently revised and subject to varying interpretations these include laws governing employment and labor wage and hour environmental matters proper handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste healthcare data privacy cybersecurity the pricing and sale of goods import and export compliance and transportation and logistics among others these laws may differ substantially in the areas where we operate although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws there can be no certainty that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable laws if we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to governmental enforcement action or private litigation resulting in monetary penalties reputational harm and increased costs of regulatory compliance any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations we may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies as a result of enforcing existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities which can occur in the ordinary course of business or may result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency or toward a particular industry

​ 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected by litigation 

​ 

we are involved in lawsuits regulatory investigations governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business such matters involve significant expense and divert management’s attention and resources from other matters the damages sought against us in these proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the us was stagnated and unemployment was at historically high levels during the great recession while in recent years the unemployment rate has improved to below prerecession levels unemployment has again reached historically high levels due to covid19 moreover the us government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures inflation foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant geopolitical conflicts proposed or additional tariffs continued volatility in energy prices the impact of a public health crisis or pandemic such as covid19 and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs it is unclear how such factors could impact our business in the short term over a longer period of time these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead these could adversely affect our financial condition and operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in 2004 we acquired a store site in mount ephraim new jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property 

we have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the njdep has asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 and again in an amended directive and notice to insurers dated january 13 2014 collectively the “directives” that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory by letter dated april 23 2015 njdep has demanded payment from us and other parties in the amount of approximately 296 thousand for costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property by letter dated january 29 2016 we were informed that njdep has filed a lien against the property in connection with approximately 355 thousand in costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property we have contested and will continue to contest any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the directives and the april 23 2015 demand letter in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

we are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including but not limited to several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices we do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

we currently do not pay a dividend on our common stock our ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations imposed by nevada law any future payment of dividends would be dependent upon our financial condition capital requirements earnings and cash flow

during 1998 the company announced a program permitting the company to repurchase a portion of its outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by the company’s board of directors the program was most recently amended on october 7 2019 to increase the repurchase authorization by 1250 billion bringing total value of authorized share repurchases to 2315 billion

during fiscal 2020 we temporarily ceased share repurchases under our share repurchase program to conserve liquidity in response to the uncertainty related to covid19 while we have restarted share repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 we will continue to evaluate current and expected business conditions and adjust the level of share repurchases under our share repurchase program as we deem appropriate 

the company did not purchase any shares during the quarter ended august 29 2020

the company also repurchased at market value an additional 8287 17201 and 11816 shares in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively from employees electing to sell their stock under the company’s sixth amended and restated employee stock purchase plan the “employee plan” qualified under section 423 of the internal revenue code under which all eligible employees may purchase autozone’s common stock at 85 of the lower of the market price of the common stock on the first day or last day of each calendar quarter through payroll deductions maximum permitted annual purchases are 15000 per employee or 10 percent of compensation whichever is less under the employee plan 10525 11011 and 14523 shares were sold to employees in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively at august 29 2020 142241 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the employee plan

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

we are the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the americas we began operations in 1979 and at august 29 2020 operated 5885 stores in the us 621 stores in mexico and 43 stores in brazil each store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 29 2020 in 5007 of our domestic stores we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in all stores in mexico and brazil we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we also provide product information on our duralast branded products through wwwduralastpartscom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services

covid19 impact 

​ 

the outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus “covid19” which was declared a global pandemic on march 11 2020 by the world health organization has led to adverse impacts on the national and global economy we have been able to keep our stores open and operating in the us initially we reduced the hours of operation in most stores but subsequently have returned to more normal operating hours we have also taken numerous measures to ensure the health safety and wellbeing of our customers and employees we provided new emergency timeoff benefit enhancements for both fulltime and parttime eligible hourly employees in the us we invested in supplies for the protection of our employees and customers increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting and introduced new service options for customers such as curbside pickup among other things these expanded benefits supply costs and other covid19 related costs resulted in approximately 839 million of expense included in operating selling general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the year ended august 29 2020 

​ 

in march 2020 we issued 1250 billion in senior notes and closed on a new 364day senior unsecured revolving credit facility to strengthen our financial position and our ability to be responsive during this everchanging environment we have also experienced challenges in recruiting and hiring employees in certain of our retail stores and distribution centers 

​ 

while sales were initially negatively impacted they have since increased to record levels however we are unable to accurately predict the impact that covid19 will have due to numerous uncertainties including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities intended to minimize the spread of the pandemic or to stimulate the economy or other unintended consequences accordingly continued business disruption related to the covid19 outbreak may continue to cause significant fluctuations in our business unusually impacting demand for our products our store hours and our workforce availability and magnify risks associated with sourcing quality merchandise domestically and outside the us at competitive prices some of which would adversely impact our business and results of operations further a resurgence of the outbreak or other unforeseen developments may impede our ability to complete construction and open new stores at our desired pace

​ 

our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs wage rates and other economic conditions including for fiscal 2020 covid19 given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

​ 

‌ ​ 

executive summary

for fiscal 2020 we achieved record net income of 1733 billion a 72 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 7682 million a 65 increase over the prior year domestic commercial sales increased 64 which represents 216 of our total sales fiscal 2020 consisted of 52 weeks whereas fiscal 2019 consisted of 53 weeks both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we continue to make progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say “yes” to our customers more frequently drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial growth

our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs wage rates and other economic conditions including for fiscal 2020 the effects of and responses to covid19 given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future

one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2020 was gas prices during fiscal 2020 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the us was 232 per gallon compared to 263 per gallon during fiscal 2019 we believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers’ level of disposable income with approximately 12 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 12 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods

we have also experienced continued accelerated pressure on wages in the us during fiscal 2020 some of this is attributed to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities while the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers the regulatory changes are expected to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase employees’ wages substantially over the next few years but we are still assessing to what degree these changes will impact our earnings growth in future periods

during fiscal 2020 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to comprise our largest set of categories while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years in our domestic stores we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the discretionary category as compared to last year we believe the improvement in this sales category resulted from the pandemic as many of our customers had more time to work on projects the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road

miles driven

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including macroeconomic factors and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through july 2020 latest publicly available information miles driven in the us decreased by 88 compared to the same period in the prior year we believe this decrease is a result of the pandemic but we are unable to predict if this decline will continue and are uncertain if it continues the impact it will have to our business

‌ ​ 

seven year old or older vehicles

new vehicles sales decreased 08 during 2020 as compared to the prior calendar year we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating

according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2020 the average age of vehicles on the road was 119 years for the ninth consecutive year the average age of vehicles has exceeded 11 years

we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell

results of operations

fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019

for the fiscal year ended august 29 2020 we reported net sales of 12632 billion compared with 11864 billion for the year ended august 31 2019 a 65 increase from fiscal 2019 this growth was driven primarily by a domestic same store sales increase of 74 and net sales of 2447 million from new stores same store sales are computed on a 52week basis domestic commercial sales increased 1649 million or 64 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2019

at august 29 2020 we operated 5885 domestic stores 621 in mexico and 43 in brazil compared with 5772 domestic stores 604 in mexico and 35 in brazil at august 31 2019 we reported a total auto parts segment domestic mexico and brazil sales increase of 65 for fiscal 2020

gross profit for fiscal 2020 was 6771 billion or 536 of net sales a 5 basis point decrease compared with 6365 billion or 537 of net sales for fiscal 2019 the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower merchandise margins driven primarily by a shift in mix

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 increased to 4353 billion or 345 of net sales from 4149 billion or 350 of net sales for fiscal 2019 the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to leverage from higher sales growth partially offset by 839 million of costs incurred in response to covid19 

interest expense net for fiscal 2020 was 2012 million compared with 1848 million during fiscal 2019 this increase was primarily due to higher debt levels average borrowings for fiscal 2020 were 5393 billion compared with 5097 billion for fiscal 2019 weighted average borrowing rates were 33 for fiscal 2020 and 32 for fiscal 2019

our effective income tax rate was 218 of pretax income for fiscal 2020 compared to 204 for fiscal 2019 the increase in the tax rate was primarily attributable to a reduced benefit from stock options exercised during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 the benefit of stock options exercised for fiscal 2020 was 209 million compared to 460 million for fiscal 2019 see “note d – income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

net income for fiscal 2020 increased by 72 to 1733 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 134 to 7193 from 6343 in fiscal 2019 net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 benefitted from an additional week of sales the impact on the fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases was an increase of 159

fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018

a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 has been omitted from this form 10k but may be found in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended august 31 2019 filed with the sec on october 28 2019 which is available free of charge on the secs website at wwwsecgov and at wwwautozonecom by clicking “investor relations” located at the bottom of the page

quarterly periods

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2020 17 weeks in 2019 and 16 weeks in 2018 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of our annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 represented 360 of annual sales and 427 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 represented 336 of annual sales and 350 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 represented 317 of annual sales and 299 of net income

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” was enacted into law tax reform significantly revises the us federal corporate income tax by among other things lowering the statutory federal corporate rate from 35 to 21 eliminating certain deductions imposing a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and changing how foreign earnings are subject to us federal tax also in december 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of gaap in situations when the registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of tax reform 

during the year ended august 25 2018 we recorded provisional tax benefit of 1315 million related to tax reform comprised of 1573 million remeasurement of its net deferred tax asset “dta” offset by 258 million of transition tax during the year ended august 31 2019 we completed our analysis of tax reform and recorded adjustments to the previouslyrecorded provisional amounts resulting in an 88 million tax benefit primarily related to transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 

beginning with the year ending august 31 2019 we are subject to a new tax on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” that is imposed on foreign earnings we have made the election to record this tax as a period cost and therefore have not adjusted the deferred tax assets or liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for the new tax net impacts for gilti are included in the provision for income taxes for the years ended august 29 2020 and august 31 2019

liquidity and capital resources

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 2720 billion in 2020 2129 billion in 2019 and 2080 billion in 2018 cash flows from operations are favorable compared to last year primarily due to growth in net income due to accelerated sales growth as a result of the pandemic

‌ ​ 

our net cash flows used in investing activities were 4979 million in fiscal 2020 4918 million in fiscal 2019 and 5219 million in fiscal 2018 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was the result of an investment in a tax credit equity investment partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures we invested 4577 million in capital assets in fiscal 2020 4961 million in fiscal 2019 and 5218 million in fiscal 2018 we had 138 new location openings for fiscal 2020 209 for fiscal 2019 and 201 for fiscal 2018 the decrease in capital expenditures from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was attributable to delayed store openings in response to covid19 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable debt securities we purchased 909 million in marketable debt securities in fiscal 2020 555 million in fiscal 2019 and 1045 million in fiscal 2018 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of 842 million in fiscal 2020 531 million in fiscal 2019 and 696 million in fiscal 2018

net cash used in financing activities was 6436 million in fiscal 2020 1674 billion in fiscal 2019 and 1632 billion in fiscal 2018 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 9309 million for fiscal 2020 2005 billion for fiscal 2019 and 1592 billion for fiscal 2018 the decrease in purchases of treasury stock for fiscal 2020 was due to the temporary suspension of the share repurchase program in order to conserve liquidity in response to the uncertainty related to covid19 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations the company issued 1850 billion of new debt in 2020 750 million in fiscal 2019 and none in fiscal 2018 in fiscal 2020 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes repayment of our outstanding commercial paper and repayment of our 500 million senior notes due in november 2020 which were callable at par in august 2020  in fiscal 2019 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings our 250 million senior notes due in april 2019 and for general corporate purposes in fiscal 2018 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay our 250 million senior notes due in august 2018 

in fiscal 2020 we made net repayments of commercial paper and short term borrowings in the amount of 1030 billion net repayments of commercial paper and short term borrowings for fiscal 2019 were 2953 million and net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2018 were 1702 million

during fiscal 2021 we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2020 the expected increase is driven by delays in capital spending for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 related to covid19 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations supply chain infrastructure enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology the amount of investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 our capital expenditures decreased from the prior fiscal year by approximately 8 5 and 6 respectively

in addition to building and land costs our new locations require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their autozone receivables allowing them to receive early payment from the financial institution on our invoices at a discounted rate the terms of these agreements are between the vendor and the financial institution upon request from the vendor we confirm to the vendor’s financial institution the balances owed to the vendor the due date and agree to waive any right of offset to the confirmed balances a downgrade in our credit or changes in the financial markets may limit the financial institutions’ willingness to participate in these arrangements which may result in the vendor wanting to renegotiate payment terms a reduction in payment terms would increase the working capital required to fund future inventory investments extended payment terms from our vendors have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1153 at august 29 2020 and 1126 at august 31 2019 the increase from fiscal 2019 was primarily due to accelerated sales growth

‌ ​ 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 29 2020 and august 31 2019 cash and cash equivalents of 624 million and 499 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support the liquidity needs in our foreign operations

for the fiscal year ended august 29 2020 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 381 as compared to 357 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases for fiscal 2020 roic was presented net of average excess cash of 3742 million for fiscal 2019 aftertax operating profit was adjusted for the tax reform’s impact on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities net of the repatriation tax we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation

debt facilities

we entered into a master extension new commitment and amendment agreement dated as of november 18 2017 the “extension amendment” to the third amended and restated credit agreement dated as of november 18 2016 as amended modified extended or restated from time to time the “revolving credit agreement” under the extension amendment i our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement was increased from 16 billion to 20 billion ii the maximum borrowing under the revolving credit agreement may at our option subject to lenders approval be increased from 20 billion to 24 billion iii the termination date of the revolving credit agreement was extended from november 18 2021 until november 18 2022 and iv we have the option to make one additional written request of the lenders to extend the termination date then in effect for an additional year under the revolving credit agreement we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans base rate loans or a combination of both interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as libor plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit agreement depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt ratings interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit agreement 

on april 3 2020 we entered into a 364day credit agreement the “364day credit agreement” to augment our access to liquidity due to current macroeconomic conditions specifically the pandemic and supplement our existing revolving credit agreement the 364day credit agreement provides for loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to 750 million the 364day credit agreement will terminate and all amounts borrowed under the 364day credit agreement will be due and payable on april 2 2021 revolving loans under the 364day credit agreement may be base rate loans eurodollar loans or a combination of both at our election

as of august 29 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings under each of our revolving credit agreements and had 17 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit agreement

under our revolving credit agreements covenants include restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances

the revolving credit agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 251 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 29 2020 was 611

‌ ​ 

as of august 29 2020 the 250 million 2500 senior notes due april 2021 are classified as longterm in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit agreements as of august 29 2020 we had 2748 billion of availability before giving effect to commercial paper borrowings under our 2750 billion revolving credit agreements which would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing facilities

we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 25 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit agreement as of august 29 2020 we had 250 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2022

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 2203 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 29 2020 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis

on august 14 2020 we issued 600 million in 1650 senior notes due january 2031 under our automatic shelf registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec on april 4 2019 file no 333230719 the “2019 shelf registration” the 2019 shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of the 500 million in 4000 senior notes due in november 2020 that were callable at par in august 2020

on march 30 2020 we issued 500 million in 3625 senior notes due april 2025 and 750 million in 4000 senior notes due april 2030 under the 2019 shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes

on april 18 2019 we issued 300 million in 3125 senior notes due april 2024 and 450 million in 3750 senior notes due april 2029 under the 2019 shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings the 250 million in 1625 senior notes due in april 2019 and for other general corporate purposes

all senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned are downgraded as defined in the agreements further the senior notes contain a provision that repayment may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens sale and leaseback transactions and consolidations mergers and the sale of assets all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the applicable scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs

as of august 29 2020 we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements

for the fiscal year ended august 29 2020 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 191 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt finance lease liabilities and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income for fiscal 2020 debt was presented net of excess cash which ended the year at 16 billion we target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels

to the extent ebitdar continues to grow in future years we expect our debt levels to increase conversely if ebitdar declines we would expect our debt levels to decrease refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on october 7 2019 the board voted to authorize the repurchase of an additional 125 billion of our common stock in connection with our ongoing share repurchase program since the inception of the repurchase program in 1998 the board has authorized 2315 billion in share repurchases from january 1998 to august 29 2020 we have repurchased a total of 1477 million shares at an aggregate cost of 22354 billion we repurchased 826 thousand shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 9309 million during fiscal 2020 22 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2005 billion during fiscal 2019 and 24 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1592 billion during fiscal 2018 the decrease in purchases of treasury stock for fiscal 2020 was due to the temporary suspension of the share repurchase program in order to preserve cash as a result of the uncertainty related to the pandemic considering cumulative repurchases as of august 29 2020 we had 7959 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock

for the fiscal year ended august 29 2020 cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was 2185 billion as compared to 1759 billion during the comparable prior year period cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less net increases or decreases in debt plus share repurchases we use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available we believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation

during fiscal 2020 we temporarily ceased share repurchases under our share repurchase program to conserve liquidity in response to the uncertainty related to covid19 while we have restarted share repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 we will continue to evaluate current and expected business conditions and adjust the level of share repurchases under our share repurchase program as we deem appropriate

subsequent to august 29 2020 we have repurchased 269795 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 3144 million considering the cumulative repurchases subsequent to august 29 2020 we have 4815 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase its common stock

financial commitments

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 29 2020

 ​ 



‌ ​ 

 

our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 230 million at august 29 2020 approximately 20 million is classified as current liabilities and 210 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the longterm liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions

offbalance sheet arrangements

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 29 2020

 ​ 

a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers

there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

recent accounting pronouncements

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements

critical accounting policies and estimates

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management

selfinsurance reserves

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation general product liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2886 million at august 29 2020 and 2070 million at august 31 2019 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in healthcare costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience where estimable losses covered by insurance are recognized on a gross basis with a corresponding insurance receivable

​ 

‌ ​ 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and use of a specialist to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about healthcare costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 224 million for fiscal 2020 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date

if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 25 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 14 million for fiscal 2020 

income taxes

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions

we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 29 2020 we had approximately 230 million reserved for uncertain tax positions

we evaluate exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected

‌ ​ 

vendor allowances

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of the cost of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 85 of the vendor funds received during fiscal 2020 were recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and typically have a legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 1 million in each of the last three years




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes

interest rate risk

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 6081 billion as of august 29 2020 and 5419 billion as of august 31 2019 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 5675 million at august 29 2020 which reflects its face amount adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts at august 31 2019 the fair value was greater than the carrying value of debt by 2127 million

we had no variable rate debt outstanding at august 29 2020 and 1030 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 31 2019 

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 5513 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 366 million at august 29 2020 and 4176 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 237 million at august 31 2019 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 3187 million at august 29 2020

‌ ​ 

foreign currency risk

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 2931 million at august 29 2020 and 3288 million at august 31 2019 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 10 and approximately 7 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively the loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 29 2020 and august 31 2019 would have been approximately 266 million and approximately 299 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

at august 31 2019 our stores were in the following locations 

 

  

 marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as identifying any associated warranties that are offered by us or our vendors we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business with next day delivery covering approximately 85 of the us population additionally we offer a smartphone application that provides customers with store locations driving directions operating hours product availability and ability to purchase products 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators and batteries 

 

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

 we believe that the satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire 

pricing 

we want to be the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes autozone duralast duralast max duralast gold duralast platinum duralast propower duralast gt valucraft surebilt proelite and trugrade we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors 

brand marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty programs primarily to highlight our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving retail traffic to our stores while we leverage a dedicated sales force and our provantage loyalty program to drive commercial sales in the stores we utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 

 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are a leading distributor of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the americas as a part of the domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space in our satellite stores approximately 40 to 45 of our space is dedicated to hard parts inventory while our hub stores and mega hubs have 75 to 85 of their space utilized for hard parts the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting with related cascading meetings at our distribution centers regional offices and stores store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized computerbased training to support culture safety salesmanship compliance and product and job knowledge and several specialist vendor and thirdparty programs to support learning and development in areas requiring technical expertise and specific job knowledge all domestic autozoners are encouraged to complete our inhouse product knowledge program and parts expert certification which is developed in partnership with our key suppliers training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management advanced leadership training is an additional area of investment that is used to deepen bench strength and support succession planning 

store managers commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

 

store development 

the following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years 

 

  

  we believe that expansion opportunities exist in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store is the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations for stores include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we seek to open new stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil additionally we have an office in shanghai china to support our sourcing efforts in asia in fiscal 2019 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 13 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied approximately 12 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms the distribution centers replenish all stores up to multiple times per week depending on store sales volumes 

we ended fiscal 2019 with 205 total domestic hub stores which have a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment 

as a subset we ended fiscal 2019 with 35 domestic mega hubs an increase of 11 since fiscal 2018 mega hubs work in concert with our hubs to drive customer satisfaction through improved local parts availability and expanded product assortments a mega hub store carries inventory of 70000 to 110000 unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis currently we have over 5500 domestic stores with access to mega hub inventory a majority of these 5500 stores currently receive their service on an overnight basis but as we expand our mega hubs more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times per day 

 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layouts location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks 

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” “autozone rewards” “get in the zone” “parts are just part of what we do” “provantage” “the best parts in auto parts” “zone” and trademarks “alldata collision” “alldata manage” “alldata mobile” “alldata repair” “alldata techassist” “autozone” “autozone  design” “duralast” “duralast aero blade” “duralast flex blade” “duralast gold” “duralast gold cmax” “duralast gt” “duralast platinum” “duralast propower” “duralast propower plus” “duralast propower ultra” “duralast propower agm” “duralast max” “econocraft” “loanatool” “proelite” “proelite  design” “surebilt” “trugrade” “valucraft” “v  design” and “znet” we believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing and merchandising strategies 

employees 

as of august 31 2019 we employed approximately 96000 persons approximately 58 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 90 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 5 percent in distribution centers and approximately 5 percent in store support and other functions included in the above numbers are approximately 10000 persons employed in our mexico and brazil operations 

we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our autozoners are good 

seasonality 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 10 to 20 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have locations throughout the americas 

autozone websites

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results cash flows and stock price the following information should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make with the sec these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors could result in a decline in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our business and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing locations autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising online and multichannel retailers often focus on delivery services offering customers faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping some online businesses have lower operating costs than we do in addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors which also puts pressure on our margins 

consumers are embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications with the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors’ increased focus on optimizing customers’ online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings we believe that we compete effectively on the basis of merchandise availability as a result of investments in inventory available for immediate sale the development of a robust hub and mega hub distribution network providing efficient access to obtain products required ondemand options to order products online or by telephone and pick them up in stores and options for special orders directly from our vendors we also offer hasslefree returns to our customers in addition we believe that customers value the personal interaction with a salesperson that is qualified to offer trustworthy advice and provide other free services such as parts testing 

we also utilize promotions advertising and our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive marketplace if we are unable to continue to manage readilyavailable inventory demand and competitive delivery options as well as develop successful competitive strategies including the maintenance of effective promotions advertising and loyalty card programs or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 5391 stores at august 30 2014 to 6411 stores at august 31 2019 an average store increase per year of 4 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 9475 billion in fiscal 2014 to 11864 billion in fiscal 2019 an average increase per year of 5 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores the development of new commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by economic pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

historically some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment 

 

these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could achieve greater market penetration could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket participants have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue debt securities 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions during the great recession resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates we can provide no assurance that such similar events that occurred during the great recession will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm and longterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the us was stagnated and unemployment was at historically high levels during the great recession however in recent years the unemployment rate has improved to below prerecession levels moreover the us government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures inflation foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant geopolitical conflicts proposed or additional tariffs continued volatility in energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs over the shortterm such factors could positively impact our business over a longer period of time these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead these could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

 

our business depends upon hiring training and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the approximately 96000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and alldata our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage and benefits in addition the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire train and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk of market increases in compensation 

if we are unable to hire properly train and retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales regulatory noncompliance losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment and labor laws including changes in existing employment benefit programs such as health insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at favorable prices and payment terms if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses resulting in increased product costs and difficulties in meeting our inventory demands if we experience transitions or changeover with any of our significant vendors or if they experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

risks associated with products sourced outside the us 

we directly imported approximately 14 of our purchases in fiscal 2019 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the price or flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties or tariffs merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import often are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability in addition the foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we or our domestic vendors increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports will also increase 

 

our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new locations into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price and to meet consumer product needs if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain initiatives including directly sourcing some products from outside the us do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increases in our operating costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if customers have a bad experience and share it over social media 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations the inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

 

our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets 

the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us in addition to the unique costs risks and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions 

risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences potential changes to trade policies and trade agreements compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery and anticorruption laws greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance 

failure to protect or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy and security of customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs 

our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers’ suppliers’ employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales we consider information security to be a top priority and undertake cybersecurity planning and activities throughout the company senior management and the board of directors are actively engaged in cybersecurity risk management while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our systems these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error system compromises fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data we believe that our preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks however our business or our third party providers with which we share sensitive information may not discover a security breach or loss of information for a significant period after the security breach occurs failure to effectively respond to system compromises may undermine our security measures the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time to date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity however our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs there can be no assurance that our security measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident the cost to remediate damages to our systems suffered as a result of a cyberattack could be significant 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit debit electronic payments such as paypal apple pay etc and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and payment card industry data security standard even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future 

 

to the extent that any cyberattack or intrusion in our or one of our thirdparty service provider’s information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

we have invested in informationtechnology risk management and disaster recovery plans although these plans are in place we must provide ongoing monitoring and consistently revise our plans as technologies change rapidly and our efforts to overcome security risks continue to become increasingly more complex and concentrated 

our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be affected by environmental tax and employment laws or other governmental actions 

we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations which may impact our business we could be impacted by environmental laws and regulations including initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change although we are not certain that these initiatives will become regulations if the regulations become enacted they could adversely impact our costs 

our business is subject to changes in tax laws and regulations which could impact our overall tax liability governments may issue guidance or enact tax laws which could result in changes to our tax position and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected by litigation 

we are involved in lawsuits regulatory investigations governmental and other legal procedures arising out of the ordinary course of business legal action may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory communicate with customers process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so 

if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business is in the process of developing and implementing various information systems as well as modifying existing systems these technological changes will require significant investment of human and financial resources and our business may experience significant delays costs increases and other obstacles with these projects although we have invested significant resources during our planning project management and training implementation issues may arise which may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest unusual weather conditions hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes floods and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the us and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty transporting merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in 2004 we acquired a store site in mount ephraim new jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property 

we have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the njdep has asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 and again in an amended directive and notice to insurers dated january 13 2014 collectively the “directives” that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory by letter dated april 23 2015 njdep has demanded payment from us and other parties in the amount of approximately 296 thousand for costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property by letter dated january 29 2016 we were informed that njdep has filed a lien against the property in connection with approximately 355 thousand in costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property we have contested and will continue to contest any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the directives and the april 23 2015 demand in the area of the property 

 

pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2014 we received a subpoena from the district attorney of the county of alameda along with other environmental prosecutorial offices in the state of california seeking documents and information related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste a complaint regarding the matter was subsequently filed by the district attorney and the state attorney general’s office the company cooperated fully with the district attorney and the state attorney general’s office to resolve the matter in fiscal 2019 without a finding of liability on the part of the company the amount the company agreed to pay was within the amount previously accrued by the company for the matter 

arising out of an april 2016 letter from the california air resources board “carb” one of our formerlyowned subsidiaries was sued in march 2018 by carb and the state of california seeking penalties among other relief for alleged violations of the california health and safety code title 13 of the california code of regulations and the california vehicle code related to the sale and advertisement of certain aftermarket motor vehicle pollution control parts in the state of california on february 26 2018 we completed our transaction to sell substantially all the assets net of assumed liabilities related to our autoanything operations as part of the sale we retained the liability related to this lawsuit the company cooperated fully with carb and the state attorney general’s office to resolve the matter in fiscal 2019 without a finding of liability on the part of the company the amount the company agreed to pay was within the amount previously accrued by the company for the matter 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including but not limited to several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices we do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the americas we began operations in 1979 and at august 31 2019 operated 5772 stores in the us including puerto rico and saint thomas 604 stores in mexico and 35 stores in brazil each store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 31 2019 in 4893 of our domestic stores we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in stores in mexico and brazil we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

for fiscal 2019 we achieved record net income of 1617 billion a 209 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 6427 million a 57 increase over the prior year both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we continue to make progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial growth 

 

our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs wage rates and other economic conditions given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2019 was gas prices during fiscal 2019 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the us was 263 per gallon compared to 267 per gallon during fiscal 2018 we believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers’ level of disposable income with approximately 12 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 12 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

we have also experienced accelerated pressure on wages in the us during fiscal 2019 some of this is attributed to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities while the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment rates and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers the regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years but we are still assessing to what degree these changes will impact our earnings growth in future periods 

during fiscal 2019 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 85 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to comprise our largest set of categories while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years in our domestic stores we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the failure category as compared to last year we believe the improvement in this sales category was driven by differences in regional weather patterns and improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather over a short term period over the long term we believe the impact of the weather on our sales mix is not significant 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through july 2019 latest publicly available information miles driven in the us increased by 08 compared to the same period in the prior year 

seven year old or older vehicles 

new vehicles sales increased 02 during 2019 as compared to the prior calendar year we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating 

according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2019 the average age of vehicles on the road was 118 years for the eighth consecutive year the average age of vehicles has exceeded 11 years 

we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell 

 

results of operations 

fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 

for the fiscal year ended august 31 2019 we reported net sales of 11864 billion compared with 11221 billion for the year ended august 25 2018 a 57 increase from fiscal 2018 this growth was driven primarily by net sales of 4105 million from new domestic stores the additional 53 rd week sales of 2386 million and a domestic same store sales increase of 30 partially offset by the impact of the sale of two businesses in the prior year same store sales are computed on a 52week basis domestic commercial sales increased 3486 million or 157 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2018 which benefited 513 million from the additional week of sales 

at august 31 2019 we operated 5772 domestic stores 604 in mexico and 35 in brazil compared with 5618 domestic stores 564 in mexico and 20 in brazil at august 25 2018 we reported a total auto parts segment domestic mexico brazil and imc through april 4 2018 sales increase of 63 for fiscal 2019 

gross profit for fiscal 2019 was 6365 billion or 537 of net sales a 41 basis point increase compared with 5974 billion or 532 of net sales for fiscal 2018 the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the sale of two businesses completed in the prior year 37 basis points 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 decreased to 4149 billion or 350 of net sales from 4163 billion or 371 of net sales for fiscal 2018 the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to last year’s impairment charges of 1932 million related to the sale of two businesses and pension plan termination charges of 1303 million partially offset by increased domestic store payroll 66 basis points in 2019 see “note l – pension and savings plan” and “note m – sale of assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net for fiscal 2019 was 1848 million compared with 1745 million during fiscal 2018 this increase was primarily due to higher debt levels and an additional week of interest incurred due to the 53 rd week average borrowings for fiscal 2019 were 5097 billion compared with 4997 billion for fiscal 2018 and weighted average borrowing rates were 32 for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 

our effective income tax rate was 204 of pretax income for fiscal 2019 compared to 183 for fiscal 2018 the higher tax rate resulted primarily from net impacts of the enactment of tax reform see “note d  income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

net income for fiscal 2019 increased by 209 to 1617 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 301 to 6343 from 4877 in fiscal 2018 the impact on the fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases was an increase of 183 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 has been omitted from this form 10k but may be found in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended august 25 2018 filed with the sec on october 24 2018 which is available free of charge on the secs website at wwwsecgov and at wwwautozonecom by clicking “investor relations” located at the bottom of the page 

quarterly periods 

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks in 2019 and 16 weeks in 2018 and 2017 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 represented 336 of annual sales and 350 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 represented 317 of annual sales and 299 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 represented 323 of annual sales and 339 of net income 

 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted tax reform into law tax reform significantly revises the us federal corporate income tax by among other things lowering the statutory federal corporate rate from 35 to 21 eliminating certain deductions imposing a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and changing how foreign earnings are subject to us federal tax also in december 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of gaap in situations when the registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared and analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of tax reform 

during the year ended august 25 2018 we recorded provisional tax benefit of 1315 million related to tax reform comprised of a 1573 million remeasurement of our net deferred tax asset “dta” offset by 258 million of transition tax during the year ended august 31 2019 the company completed its analysis of tax reform and recorded adjustments to the previouslyrecorded provisional amounts resulting in an 88 million tax benefit primarily related to transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 

beginning with the year ending august 31 2019 we are subject to a new tax on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” that is imposed on foreign earnings we have made the election to record this tax as a period cost thus we have not adjusted the deferred tax assets or liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries for the new tax net impacts for gilti were immaterial and are included in the provision for income taxes for the year ending august 31 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 2129 billion in 2019 2080 billion in 2018 and 1571 in 2017 cash flows from operations are favorable compared to last year primarily due to the timing of payment of accounts payable and growth in net income partially due to the additional week of sales in the current year 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newlocation development program and the building of new distribution centers net cash flows used in investing activities were 4918 million in fiscal 2019 compared to 5219 million in fiscal 2018 and 5536 million in fiscal 2017 we invested 4961 million in capital assets in fiscal 2019 compared to 5218 million in fiscal 2018 and 5538 million in fiscal 2017 we had new location openings of 209 for fiscal 2019 201 for fiscal 2018 and 215 for fiscal 2017 the decrease in capital expenditures from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was attributable to one distribution center opening in fiscal 2018 and none constructed in fiscal 2019 we opened two distribution centers in fiscal 2017 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable debt securities we purchased 555 million in marketable debt securities in fiscal 2019 1045 million in fiscal 2018 and 857 million in fiscal 2017 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of 531 million in fiscal 2019 696 million in fiscal 2018 and 830 million in fiscal 2017 

net cash used in financing activities was 1674 billion in 2019 1632 billion in 2018 and 9143 million in 2017 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 2005 billion for fiscal 2019 1592 billion for fiscal 2018 and 1072 billion for fiscal 2017 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations the company issued 750 million of new debt in fiscal 2019 compared to none in fiscal 2018 and 600 million for fiscal 2017 in fiscal 2019 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and our 250 million senior notes due in april 2019 and for other general corporate purposes in fiscal 2018 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay our 250 million senior notes due in august 2018 in fiscal 2017 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 400 million senior notes due in january 2017 

in fiscal 2019 we made net repayments of commercial paper and short term borrowings in the amount of 2953 million net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2018 were 1702 million and net repayments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2017 were 424 million 

 

during fiscal 2020 we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2019 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations supply chain infrastructure enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology the amount of investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2019 and 2018 our capital expenditures decreased by approximately 5 and 6 respectively compared to the prior year period in fiscal 2017 our capital expenditures increased by approximately 13 as compared to the prior year 

in addition to the building and land costs our new locations require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate in recent years we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per location many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1126 at august 31 2019 and 1118 at august 25 2018 the increase from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to more favorable vendor terms 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 31 2019 and august 25 2018 cash and cash equivalents of 499 million and 988 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support the liquidity needs in our foreign operations 

for the fiscal year ended august 31 2019 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 357 as compared to 321 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases for fiscal 2019 aftertax operating profit was adjusted for the tax reform’s impact on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities net of the repatriation tax for fiscal 2018 aftertax operating profit was adjusted for impairment charges pension termination charges and tax reform’s impact on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities net of the repatriation tax the increase in roic in fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the increase in net income due to the additional week of operations we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

debt facilities 

we entered into a master extension new commitment and amendment agreement dated as of november 18 2017 the “extension amendment” to the third amended and restated credit agreement dated as of november 18 2016 as amended modified extended or restated from time to time the “revolving credit agreement” under the extension amendment i our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement was increased from 16 billion to 20 billion ii our option to increase the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement was “refreshed” and the amount of such option remained at 400 million iii the maximum borrowing under the revolving credit agreement may at our option subject to lenders approval be increased from 20 billion to 24 billion iv the termination date of the revolving credit agreement was extended from november 18 2021 until november 18 2022 and v we have the option to make one additional written request of the lenders to extend the termination date then in effect for an additional year under the revolving credit agreement we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans base rate loans or a combination of both 

 

interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as libor plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit agreement depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt ratings interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit agreement as of august 31 2019 we had 33 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 251 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 31 2019 was 571 

as of august 31 2019 our 1030 billion of commercial paper borrowings were classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance them on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facilities as of august 31 2019 we had 1997 billion of availability under our 20 billion revolving credit facility which would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing facilities 

we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 25 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit agreement in fiscal 2019 we amended our existing letter of credit facility to decrease the amount that can be requested in letters of credit from 75 million to 25 million effective june 2019 this amendment also extended the maturity date from june 2019 to june 2022 as of august 31 2019 we had 250 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility 

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 729 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2019 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis 

on april 18 2019 we issued 300 million in 3125 senior notes due april 2024 and 450 million in 3750 senior notes due april 2029 under our automatic shelf registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec on april 4 2019 file no 333230719 the “2019 shelf registration” proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings the 250 million in 1625 senior notes due in april 2019 and for other general corporate purposes 

on april 18 2017 we issued 600 million in 3750 senior notes due june 2027 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 15 2015 the “2015 shelf registration” proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes 

the senior notes contain a provision that repayment of the senior notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens sale and leaseback transactions and consolidations mergers and the sale of assets under our revolving credit facility covenants include restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the applicable scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 31 2019 we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements 

for the fiscal years ended august 31 2019 and august 26 2018 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 251 we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income for fiscal 2018 net income was adjusted to exclude impairment charges and pension termination charges before tax impact as these charges are not reflective of ongoing operations we target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels 

 

to the extent ebitdar continues to grow in future years we expect our debt levels to increase conversely if ebitdar declines we would expect our debt levels to decrease refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on september 26 2018 the board voted to increase the authorization by 125 billion on march 20 2019 the board voted to increase the authorization by 10 billion this raised the total value of shares authorized to be repurchased to 219 billion from january 1998 to august 31 2019 we have repurchased a total of 1469 million shares at an aggregate cost of 21423 billion we repurchased 22 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2005 billion during fiscal 2019 24 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1592 billion during fiscal 2018 and 15 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1072 billion during fiscal 2017 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 31 2019 we had 4768 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

for the fiscal year ended august 31 2019 cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was 1759 billion as compared to 1596 billion during the comparable prior year period cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less net increases or decreases in debt plus share repurchases we use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available in an effort to increase shareholder value in the form of share repurchases we believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings if we allowed these funds to accumulate on our balance sheet instead of repurchasing our shares we believe our earnings per share and stock price would be negatively impacted refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

on october 7 2019 the board voted to authorize the repurchase of an additional 125 billion of our common stock in connection with our ongoing share repurchase program since the inception of the repurchase program in 1998 the board has authorized 232 billion in share repurchases subsequent to august 31 2019 we have repurchased 259384 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2846 million considering the cumulative repurchases and the increase in authorization subsequent to august 31 2019 we have 144 billion remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase its common stock 

 

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2019 

 

  

     our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 205 million at august 31 2019 approximately 18 million is classified as current liabilities and 187 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the longterm liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 31 2019 

 

 a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers 

there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

  recent accounting pronouncements 

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

selfinsurance reserves 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation general products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2070 million at august 31 2019 and 2031 million at august 25 2018 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in healthcare costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience 

 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and use of a specialist to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about healthcare costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 163 million for fiscal 2019 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date 

if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 25 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 13 million for fiscal 2019 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions 

we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 31 2019 we had approximately 205 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

 

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of the cost of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and typically have a legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 1 million in each of the last three years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 5419 billion as of august 31 2019 and 4948 billion as of august 25 2018 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 2127 million at august 31 2019 which reflects its face amount adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts at august 25 2018 the fair value was less than the carrying value of debt by 575 million 

we had 1030 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 31 2019 and 1325 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 25 2018 in fiscal 2019 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 103 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor 

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 4176 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 237 million at august 31 2019 and 3681 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 194 million at august 25 2018 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1903 million at august 31 2019 

 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 3288 million at august 31 2019 and 5907 million at august 25 2018 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 7 and approximately 6 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 the loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2019 and august 25 2018 would have been approximately 299 million and approximately 537 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

at august 25 2018 our stores were in the following locations 

 

  

 marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as identifying any associated warranties that are offered by us or our vendors we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business additionally we offer a smartphone app that provides customers with store locations driving directions operating hours ability to purchase products and product availability 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators and batteries 

 

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

 we believe that the satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire 

pricing 

we want to be the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes the autozone duralast duralast max duralast gold duralast platinum duralast propower duralast gt valucraft surebilt and proelite we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors 

brand marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty programs primarily to highlight our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving retail traffic to our stores while we leverage a dedicated sales force and our provantage loyalty program to drive commercial sales in the stores we utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 

 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil as a part of the domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space in our satellite stores approximately 40 to 45 of our space is dedicated to hard parts inventory while our hub stores and mega hubs have 75 to 85 of their space utilized for hard parts the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting with related cascading meetings at our distribution centers regional offices and stores store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized computerbased training to support culture safety salesmanship compliance and product and job knowledge and several specialist vendor and thirdparty programs to support learning and development in areas requiring technical expertise and specific job knowledge all domestic autozoners are encouraged to complete our inhouse product knowledge program and parts expert certification which is developed in partnership with our key suppliers training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management advanced leadership training is an additional area of investment that is used to deepen bench strength and support succession planning 

store managers sales representatives commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

 

store development 

the following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years 

 

  

  we believe that expansion opportunities exist in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store is the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations for stores include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we seek to open new stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil additionally we have an office in shanghai china to support our sourcing efforts in asia in fiscal 2018 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 12 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied approximately 12 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

we ended fiscal 2018 with 194 domestic hub stores which have a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment 

in recent years we closely studied our hub distribution model store inventory levels and product assortment which led to strategic tests on increased frequency of delivery to our domestic stores and significantly expanding parts assortment in select domestic stores we call mega hubs during fiscal 2018 we completed our testing and implemented new frequencies resulting in approximately 25 of our stores representing 40 of our retail sales volume and nearly 50 of our commercial sales volume receiving distribution center deliveries three or more times per week 

 

a mega hub store carries inventory of 80000 to 100000 unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis currently we have over 4800 stores with access to mega hub inventory a majority of these 4800 stores currently receive their service on an overnight basis but as we expand our mega hubs more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times per day we ended fiscal 2018 with 24 mega hubs an increase of eight since fiscal 2017 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and stock price the following information should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make with the sec these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 all of these factors could result in a decline in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our business and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing locations autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising online and multichannel retailers often focus on delivery services offering customers faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping some online businesses have lower operating costs than we do in addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors which also puts pressure on our margins 

consumers are embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications with the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors’ increased focus on optimizing customers’ online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings we believe that we compete effectively on the basis of merchandise availability as a result of investments in inventory available for immediate sale the development of a robust hub and mega hub distribution network providing efficient access to obtain products required ondemand options to order products online or by telephone and pick them up in stores and options for special orders directly from our vendors we also offer hasslefree returns to our customers in addition we believe that customers value the personal interaction with a salesperson that is qualified to offer trustworthy advice and provide other free services such as parts testing 

we also utilize promotions advertising and our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive marketplace if we are unable to continue to manage readilyavailable inventory demand and competitive delivery options as well as develop successful competitive strategies including the maintenance of effective promotions advertising and loyalty card programs or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 5201 locations at august 31 2013 to 6202 locations at august 25 2018 an average store increase per year of 4 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 9148 billion in fiscal 2013 to 11221 billion in fiscal 2018 an average increase per year of 5 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores the development of new commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by the economic pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

historically some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment 

 

these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could achieve greater market penetration could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket participants have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue securities 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions during the great recession resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates we can provide no assurance that such similar events that occurred during the great recession will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm and longterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states was stagnated and unemployment was at historically high levels during the great recession however in recent years the unemployment rate has improved to below prerecession levels moreover the united states government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures inflation foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant geopolitical conflicts continued volatility in energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs over the shortterm such factors could positively impact our business over a longer period of time all of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the approximately 90000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and alldata our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements 

 

related to minimum wage and benefits in addition the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk of market increases in compensation 

if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment laws andor regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at favorable prices and payment terms if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses resulting in increased product costs and difficulties in meeting our inventory demands if we experience transitions or changeover with any of our significant vendors or if they experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

we directly imported approximately 13 of our purchases in fiscal 2018 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products disruptions in the price or flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties or tariffs merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports will also increase 

our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to 

 

partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new locations into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price and to meet consumer product needs if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain initiatives including directly sourcing some products from outside the united states do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increases in our operating costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if customers have a bad experience and share it over social media 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations the inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets 

the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us in addition to the unique costs risks and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions 

risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences potential changes to trade policies and trade agreements compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery and anticorruption laws greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy 

 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance 

failure to protect or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy and security of customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs 

our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers’ suppliers’ employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error system compromises fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data failure to effectively respond to system compromises may undermine our security measures the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit debit electronic payments and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and payment card industry data security standard even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any cyberattack or intrusion in our or one of our thirdparty service provider’s information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory communicate with customers process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so 

if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest unusual weather conditions hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes floods and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in 2004 we acquired a store site in mount ephraim new jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property 

we have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the njdep has asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 and again in an amended directive and notice to insurers dated january 13 2014 collectively the “directives” that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory by letter dated april 23 2015 njdep has demanded payment from us and other parties in the amount of approximately 296 thousand for costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property by letter dated january 29 2016 we were informed that njdep has filed a lien against the property in connection with approximately 355 thousand in costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property we have contested and will continue to contest any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of 

 

contamination some of which are named in the directives and the april 23 2015 demand in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2014 we received a subpoena from the district attorney of the county of alameda along with other environmental prosecutorial offices in the state of california seeking documents and information related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste we received notice that the district attorney will seek injunctive and monetary relief we are cooperating fully with the request and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these efforts although we have accrued all amounts we believe to be probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

arising out of an april 2016 letter from the california air resources board “carb” one of our formerlyowned subsidiaries was sued in march 2018 by carb seeking penalties among other relief for alleged violations of the california health and safety code title 13 of the california code of regulations and the california vehicle code related to the sale and advertisement of certain aftermarket motor vehicle pollution control parts in the state of california on february 26 2018 we completed our transaction to sell substantially all of the assets net of assumed liabilities related to our autoanything operations as part of the sale we retained the liability related to this lawsuit we are cooperating fully with the lawsuit and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these efforts we do not believe that any resolution of the matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including but not limited to several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices we do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 25 2018 operated 5618 stores in the united states including puerto rico 564 stores in mexico and 20 stores in brazil each store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 25 2018 in 4741 of our domestic stores we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in stores in mexico and brazil we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

for fiscal 2018 we achieved record net income of 1338 billion a 44 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 3324 million a 31 increase over the prior year both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we continue to make progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial growth 

 

our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs wage rates and other economic conditions given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2018 was gas prices during fiscal 2018 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was 267 per gallon compared to 231 per gallon during fiscal 2017 we believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers’ level of disposable income with approximately 12 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 increase at the pump reduces approximately 12 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

we have also experienced accelerated pressure on wages in the united states during fiscal 2018 some of this is attributed to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities while the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment rates and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers the regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years but we are still assessing to what degree these changes will impact our earnings growth in future periods 

during fiscal 2018 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to comprise our largest set of categories while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years in our domestic stores we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the failure category as compared to last year we believe the improvement in this sales category was driven by differences in regional weather patterns and improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather over a short term period over the long term we believe the impact of the weather on our sales mix is not significant 

our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment in recent years we closely studied our hub distribution model store inventory levels and product assortment which led to strategic tests on increased frequency of delivery to our domestic stores and significantly expanding parts assortment in select domestic stores we call mega hubs during fiscal 2018 we completed our testing and implemented new frequencies resulting in approximately 25 of our stores representing 40 of our retail sales volume and nearly 50 of our commercial sales volume receiving distribution center deliveries three or more times per week 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through july 2018 latest publicly available information miles driven in the us increased by 05 compared to the same period in the prior year 

seven year old or older vehicles 

new vehicles sales declined 15 during 2018 as compared to the prior year which is the first yearoveryear decrease since 2009 we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating 

 

according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2018 the average age of vehicles on the road was 117 years for the seventh consecutive year the average age of vehicles has exceeded 11 years 

we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell 

results of operations 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

for the fiscal year ended august 25 2018 we reported net sales of 11221 billion compared with 10889 billion for the year ended august 26 2017 a 31 increase from fiscal 2017 this growth was driven primarily by net sales of 1965 million from new domestic stores and a domestic same store sales increase of 18 domestic commercial sales increased 1514 million or 73 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2017 

at august 25 2018 we operated 5618 domestic stores 564 in mexico and 20 in brazil compared with 5465 domestic stores 524 in mexico 14 in brazil and 26 imc branches at august 26 2017 we reported a total auto parts segment domestic mexico brazil and imc through april 4 2018 sales increase of 41 for fiscal 2018 

gross profit for fiscal 2018 was 5974 billion or 532 of net sales a 53 basis point increase compared with 5740 billion or 527 of net sales for fiscal 2017 the increase in gross margin was attributable to the favorable impact of the sale of two businesses 34 basis points and higher merchandise margins partially offset by higher supply chain costs 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 increased to 4163 billion or 371 of net sales from 3660 billion or 336 of net sales for fiscal 2017 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to second quarter impairment charges 172 basis points and fourth quarter charges related to the termination of our pension plans 116 basis points see “note m – sale of assets” and “note l – pension and savings plan” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net for fiscal 2018 was 1745 million compared with 1546 million during fiscal 2017 this increase was primarily due to higher borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2018 were 4997 billion compared with 5070 billion for fiscal 2017 and weighted average borrowing rates were 32 for fiscal 2018 compared to 28 for fiscal 2017 

our effective income tax rate was 183 of pretax income for fiscal 2018 compared to 335 for fiscal 2017 the lower tax rate resulted primarily from the enactment of tax reform during the second quarter ended february 10 2018 see “note d—income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

net income for fiscal 2018 increased by 44 to 1338 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 107 to 4877 from 4407 in fiscal 2017 the impact on the fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases was an increase of 136 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

for the fiscal year ended august 26 2017 we reported net sales of 10889 billion compared with 10636 billion for the year ended august 27 2016 a 24 increase from fiscal 2016 this growth was driven primarily by net sales of 1725 million from new domestic autozone stores and domestic same store sales increase of 05 domestic commercial sales increased 1109 million or 57 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2016 

at august 26 2017 we operated 5465 domestic autozone stores 524 in mexico 14 in brazil and 26 imc branches compared with 5297 domestic autozone stores 483 in mexico eight in brazil and 26 imc branches at august 27 2016 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico brazil and imc sales increase of 26 for fiscal 2017 

 

gross profit for fiscal 2017 was 5740 billion or 527 of net sales a 2 basis point decrease compared with 5609 billion or 527 of net sales for fiscal 2016 the slight decline in gross margin was attributable to higher supply chain costs 20 basis points associated with current year inventory initiatives partially offset by higher merchandise margins 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 increased to 3660 billion or 336 of net sales from 3548 billion or 334 of net sales for fiscal 2016 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to deleverage on occupancy costs 23 basis points and domestic store payroll driven by higher wage pressure 

interest expense net for fiscal 2017 was 1546 million compared with 1477 million during fiscal 2016 this increase was primarily due to higher borrowing levels and rates average borrowings for fiscal 2017 were 5070 billion compared with 4860 billion for fiscal 2016 and weighted average borrowing rates were 28 for fiscal 2017 compared to 27 for fiscal 2016 

our effective income tax rate was 335 of pretax income for fiscal 2017 compared to 351 for fiscal 2016 the decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the company’s adoption of the new accounting guidance for sharebased payments which lowered the effective tax rate by 162 basis points 

net income for fiscal 2017 increased by 32 to 1281 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 83 to 4407 from 4070 in fiscal 2016 the impact of the fiscal 2017 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 was an increase of approximately 103 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 10 to 20 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have locations throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil 

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2018 2017 and 2016 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 represented 317 of annual sales and 299 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 represented 323 of annual sales and 339 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 represented 320 of annual sales and 344 of net income 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” into law tax reform contains several key provisions that affected the company during fiscal 2018 the enacted provisions impacting the current financial statements include a mandatory onetime transition tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a permanent reduction of the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 as the company has an august 25th fiscal yearend the impact of the lower rate will be blended resulting in a us statutory federal tax rate of approximately 259 for the fiscal year ending august 25 2018 and a 21 us statutory federal rate for fiscal years thereafter other enacted provisions which may impact the company beginning in fiscal 2019 include eliminating us federal taxation of future remitted foreign earnings other new international provisions requiring current inclusion of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations immediate expensing of capital assets and limitations on other tax deductions such as deductibility of executive compensation interest expense lobbying expenses meals and entertainment expenses and the domestic production activities deduction 

 

the company has withdrawn its assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of current and accumulated earnings of nonus subsidiaries but maintained its permanent reinvestment assertion on other basis differences related to nonus subsidiaries 

the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 to address the application of us gaap in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of tax reform to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of tax reform is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of tax reform the ultimate impact may differ from provisional amounts recorded possibly materially due to among other things additional analysis changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made and additional regulatory guidance that may be issued the accounting is expected to be completed within one year from the enactment date of tax reform 

based on our current analysis we recorded a provisional income tax benefit of 1315 million in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended august 25 2018 we were able to determine a reasonable estimate for the mandatory onetime transition tax as an increase tax expense of 258 million and for the remeasurement of our net us federal deferred tax liability at the lower rate a reduction to tax expense of 1573 million our analysis of these items is incomplete at this time we will complete the accounting for these items during the measurement period which will not extend beyond one year from the enactment date 

our effective income tax rate was 183 of pretax income for fiscal 2018 compared to 335 for fiscal 2017 the lower tax rate resulted from the 1315 million provisional amount discussed above 313 million of excess tax benefits from option exercises and a 1192 million benefit from the reduction of the us statutory rate from 35 to approximately 259 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 2080 billion in 2018 1571 billion in 2017 and 1641 billion in fiscal 2016 cash flows from operations are favorable compared to last year primarily due to the timing of payment of accounts payable and growth in net income due to the benefits of tax reform 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newlocation development program and the building of new distribution centers from the beginning of fiscal 2016 to august 25 2018 we have opened 621 new locations we opened two distribution centers in fiscal 2017 and one in fiscal 2018 net cash flows used in investing activities were 5219 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 5536 million in fiscal 2017 and 5058 million in fiscal 2016 we invested 5218 million in capital assets in fiscal 2018 compared to 5538 million in fiscal 2017 and 4888 million in fiscal 2016 the decrease in capital expenditures from fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to the construction of the one distribution center in fiscal 2018 compared to two distribution centers in fiscal 2017 we had new location openings of 201 for fiscal 2018 215 for fiscal 2017 and 205 for fiscal 2016 cash flows were also used in the purchase of other intangibles for 10 million in fiscal 2016 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 1045 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2018 857 million in fiscal 2017 and 1302 million in fiscal 2016 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 696 million in fiscal 2018 830 million in fiscal 2017 and 1205 million in fiscal 2016 

net cash used in financing activities was 1632 billion in 2018 9143 million in 2017 and 1117 billion in fiscal 2016 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1592 billion for fiscal 2018 1072 billion for fiscal 2017 and 1452 billion for fiscal 2016 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations the company did not issue any new debt in fiscal 2018 compared to 600 million for fiscal 2017 and 650 million for fiscal 2016 in fiscal 2018 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the 250 million senior notes due in august 2018 in fiscal 2017 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 400 million senior notes due in january 2017 

 

in fiscal 2016 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases in fiscal 2016 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the 300 million senior notes due in november 2015 and the 200 million senior notes due in june 2016 net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2018 were 1702 million in 2017 we made net repayments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 424 million net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2016 were 1499 million 

during fiscal 2019 we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2018 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations supply chain infrastructure enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology the amount of investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2018 our capital expenditures decreased by approximately 6 compared to the prior year period in 2017 and 2016 our capital expenditures increased by approximately 13 and 2 respectively as compared to the prior year 

in addition to the building and land costs our new locations require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate in recent years we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per location many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1118 at august 25 2018 1074 at august 26 2017 and 1128 at august 27 2016 the increase from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to more favorable vendor terms 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 25 2018 and august 26 2017 cash and cash equivalents of 988 million and 1484 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations 

for the fiscal year ended august 25 2018 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 321 as compared to 299 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases for fiscal 2018 aftertax operating profit was adjusted for impairment charges pension termination charges and tax reform’s impact on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities net of the repatriation tax the increase in roic is primarily due to the decrease in average debt along with increased net income due to tax reform we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

debt facilities 

we entered into a master extension new commitment and amendment agreement dated as of november 18 2017 the “extension amendment” to the third amended and restated credit agreement dated as of november 18 2016 as amended modified extended or restated from time to time the “revolving credit agreement” under the extension amendment i our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement was increased from 16 billion to 20 billion ii our option to increase the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement was “refreshed” and the amount of such option remained at 400 million 

 

the maximum borrowing under the revolving credit agreement may at our option subject to lenders approval be increased from 20 billion to 24 billion iii the termination date of the revolving credit agreement was extended from november 18 2021 until november 18 2022 and iv we have the option to make one additional written request of the lenders to extend the termination date then in effect for an additional year under the revolving credit agreement we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans base rate loans or a combination of both interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as libor plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit agreement depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt ratings interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit agreement as of august 25 2018 we had 33 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 251 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 25 2018 was 581 

as of august 25 2018 1325 billion of commercial paper borrowings and the 250 million 1625 senior notes due april 2019 were classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facilities as of august 25 2018 we had 1997 billion of availability under our 20 billion revolving credit facility which would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing facilities 

we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 75 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit agreement as of august 25 2018 we had 710 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires june 2019 

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 325 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 25 2018 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis 

on april 18 2017 we issued 600 million in 3750 senior notes due june 2027 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 15 2015 the “2015 shelf registration” the 2015 shelf registration allowed us to sell an indeterminate amount of debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new location openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes 

on april 21 2016 we issued 400 million in 3125 senior notes due april 2026 and 250 million in 1625 senior notes due april 2019 under the 2015 shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes 

all senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the senior notes are downgraded as defined in the agreements further the senior notes contain a provision that repayment of the senior notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facilities covenants include restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 25 2018 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

 

for the fiscal year ended august 25 2018 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 251 as compared to 261 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income for fiscal 2018 net income was adjusted to exclude impairment charges and pension termination charges before tax impact as these charges are not reflective of ongoing operations we target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels 

to the extent ebitdar continues to grow in future years we expect our debt levels to increase conversely if ebitdar declines we would expect our debt levels to decrease refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on march 20 2018 the board voted to increase the authorization by 10 billion this raised the total value of shares authorized to be repurchased to 1965 billion from january 1998 to august 25 2018 we have repurchased a total of 1447 million shares at an aggregate cost of 19418 billion we repurchased 24 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1592 billion during fiscal 2018 15 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1072 billion during fiscal 2017 and 19 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1452 billion during fiscal 2016 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 25 2018 we had 2317 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

for the fiscal year ended august 25 2018 cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was 1596 billion as compared to 1018 billion during the comparable prior year period cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less increases in debt plus share repurchases we use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available in an effort to increase shareholder value in the form of share repurchases we believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings if we allowed these funds to accumulate on our balance sheet instead of repurchasing our shares we believe our earnings per share and stock price would be negatively impacted refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

on september 26 2018 the board voted to increase the authorization by 125 billion this brings the total value of shares authorized to 209 billion subsequent to august 25 2018 we have repurchased 346979 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2634 million considering the cumulative repurchases and the increase in authorization subsequent to august 25 2018 we have 122 billion remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

 

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 25 2018 

 

  

     our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 165 million at august 25 2018 approximately 11 million is classified as current liabilities and 154 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the longterm liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 25 2018 

 

 a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers 

there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

 recent accounting pronouncements 

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market inventory cost has been determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic inventories and the weighted average cost method for mexico and brazil inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases we have exhausted our lifo reserve balance our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost which is based on average cost the difference between lifo cost and replacement cost which will be reduced upon experiencing price inflation on our merchandise purchases was 4524 million at august 25 2018 

 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 5 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results from physical inventory counts to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate shrink loss as a percent of sales 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 25 2018 would have affected net income by approximately 86 million in fiscal 2018 

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 83 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and typically have a legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 1 million in each of the last three years 

goodwill and intangibles 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting unit’s fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

 

indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates 

the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles at august 25 2018 was 3026 million related to our domestic auto parts reporting unit the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles at august 26 2017 was 4188 million with 3026 million related to our domestic auto parts reporting unit 898 million relating to our autoanything reporting unit and 264 million relating to our interamerican motor corporation reporting unit during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 the company recorded impairment charges related to its imc and autoanything businesses as the company determined that the approximate fair value less costs to sell the businesses was significantly lower than the carrying value of the net assets these businesses were subsequently sold see “note m – sale of assets” for more information 

selfinsurance reserves 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2230 million at august 25 2018 and 2205 million at august 26 2017 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in healthcare costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about healthcare costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 166 million for fiscal 2018 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 22 million for fiscal 2018 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions 

we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 25 2018 we had approximately 165 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 4948 billion as of august 25 2018 and 5171 billion as of august 26 2017 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by 575 million at august 25 2018 which reflects its face amount adjusted for any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts at august 26 2017 the fair value was greater than the carrying value of debt by 903 million we had 1325 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 25 2018 and 1155 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 26 2017 in fiscal 2018 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 133 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor 

 

we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 3681 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 194 million at august 25 2018 and 3926 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 239 million at august 26 2017 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1536 million at august 25 2018 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 5907 million at august 25 2018 and 5193 million at august 26 2017 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 6 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2018 and increased by approximately 4 during fiscal 2017 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 25 2018 and august 26 2017 would be approximately 537 million and approximately 472 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

at august 26 2017 our autozone stores and imc branches were in the following locations 

 

  

 marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as identifying any associated warranties that are offered by us or our vendors we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business additionally we offer smartphone apps that provide customers with store locations driving directions operating hours ability to purchase products and product availability 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators and batteries 

 

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

 we believe that the satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire 

pricing 

we want to be the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes the valucraft autozone surebilt proelite duralast duralast max duralast gold duralast platinum duralast propower and duralast gt brands we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors 

brand marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty programs primarily to highlight our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving retail traffic to our stores while we leverage a dedicated sales force and our provantage loyalty program to drive commercial sales in the stores we utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 

 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico and mexico as a part of the domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space in our satellite stores approximately 40 to 45 of our space is dedicated to hard parts inventory while our hub stores and mega hubs have 75 to 85 of their space utilized for hard parts the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized training manuals and computer based modules and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all domestic autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store and branch support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil and our branch support center located in canoga park california we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our autozone stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen 

our autozone stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

 

store development 

the following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years 

 

  

 we believe that expansion opportunities exist in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new autozone store or imc branch are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations for autozone stores and imc branches include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we seek to open new autozone stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time when selecting future sites and market locations for our imc branches we look for locations close to major highways to support imc’s delivery schedule and also consider the population of autozone stores in the market in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all autozone stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil additionally we have an office in shanghai china to support our sourcing efforts in asia merchandise is selected and purchased for all imc branches through our branch support center located in canoga park california in fiscal 2017 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 11 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied approximately 11 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

we ended fiscal 2017 with 186 domestic hub stores which have a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment 

during fiscal 2014 and 2015 we tested two new concepts of our domestic supply chain strategy increased delivery frequency to our stores utilizing our distribution centers and significantly expanded parts assortments in select stores we call mega hubs our tests were concluded during fiscal 2015 and both initiatives were expanded to additional locations in fiscal 2016 and 2017 

 

increased delivery frequency focuses on improving our instock position of our core storestocked product by providing deliveries to certain stores multiple times per week we are continuing to test our new frequency of delivery for certain volume stores to ensure the model is producing sufficient benefit to justify the costs we had roughly 2300 stores receiving more deliveries multiple times per week at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as the results have not been conclusive to date we are continuing to test different scenarios to determine the optimal approach 

a mega hub store carries inventory of 80000 to 100000 unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis currently we have over 4000 stores with access to mega hub inventory a majority of these 4000 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today but as we expand our mega hubs more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times per day we ended fiscal 2017 with 16 mega hubs an increase of five since fiscal 2016 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty store layouts location and convenience and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including 

 

  

  

  

  

 for the long term demand for our products may be affected by 

 

  

  

 all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing locations autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising online and multichannel retailers often focus on delivery services offering customers faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping some online businesses have lower operating costs than we do and may not be required to collect and remit sales taxes in all us states which may negatively impact our ability to be pricecompetitive on a taxincluded basis in addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors which also puts pressure on our margins 

consumers are embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications with the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors’ increased focus on optimizing customers’ online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings we believe that we compete effectively on the basis of merchandise availability as a result of investments in inventory available for immediate sale the development of a robust hub and mega hub distribution network providing efficient access to obtain products required ondemand options to order products online or by telephone and pick them up in stores and options for special orders directly from our vendors we also offer hasslefree returns to our customers in addition we believe that customers value the personal interaction with a salesperson that is qualified to offer trustworthy advice and provide other free services such as parts testing 

we also utilize promotions advertising and our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive marketplace if we are unable to continue to manage readilyavailable inventory demand and competitive delivery options as well as develop successful competitive strategies including the maintenance of effective promotions advertising and loyalty card programs or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

we have increased our location count in the past five fiscal years growing from 5006 locations at august 25 2012 to 6029 locations at august 26 2017 an average location increase per year of 4 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 8604 billion in fiscal 2012 to 10889 billion in fiscal 2017 an average increase per year of 5 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new locations the development of new commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new locations only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by the economic pressures mentioned above we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open locations at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

historically some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment 

 

these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could achieve greater market penetration could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket participants have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue securities 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions during the great recession resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates we can provide no assurance that such similar events that occurred during the great recession will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm and longterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the us was stagnated and unemployment was at historically high levels during the great recession however in recent years the unemployment rate has improved to prerecession levels moreover the united states government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures inflation foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant geopolitical conflicts continued volatility in energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs over the short term such factors could positively impact our business over a longer period of time all of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

 

our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 87000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata autoanything and imc our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage and benefits in addition the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk of market increases in compensation 

if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment laws andor regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at favorable prices and payment terms if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses resulting in increased product costs and difficulties in meeting our inventory demands if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

we directly imported approximately 10 of our purchases in fiscal 2017 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products disruptions in the price or flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports will also increase 

 

our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new locations into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price and to meet consumer product needs if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain initiatives including directly sourcing some products from outside the united states do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increases in our operating costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if customers have a bad experience and share it over social media 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations the inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets 

the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us in addition to the unique costs risks and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions 

 

risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences potential changes to trade policies and trade agreements compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery and anticorruption laws greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance 

failure to protect or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy and security of customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs 

our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers’ suppliers’ employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error system compromises fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data failure to effectively respond to system compromises may undermine our security measures the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs 

we accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit debit and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications as a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the american national standards institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and payment card industry data security standard even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future to the extent that any cyberattack or incursion in our or one of our thirdparty service provider’s information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others in certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial in addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory communicate with customers process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so 

 

if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations 

business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest unusual weather conditions hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes floods and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in 2004 we acquired a store site in mount ephraim new jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property 

 

we have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the njdep has asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 and again in an amended directive and notice to insurers dated january 13 2014 collectively the “directives” that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory by letter dated april 23 2015 njdep has demanded payment from us and other parties in the amount of approximately 296 thousand for costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property by letter dated january 29 2016 we were informed that njdep has filed a lien against the property in connection with approximately 355 thousand in costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property we have contested and will continue to contest any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the directives and the april 23 2015 demand in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work and the state is considering the request although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

in july 2014 we received a subpoena from the district attorney of the county of alameda along with other environmental prosecutorial offices in the state of california seeking documents and information related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste we received notice that the district attorney will seek injunctive and monetary relief we are cooperating fully with the request and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these efforts although we have accrued all amounts we believe to be probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in april 2016 we received a letter from the california air resources board seeking payment for alleged violations of the california health and safety code related to the sale of certain aftermarket emission parts in the state of california we do not believe that any resolution of the matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices we do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 26 2017 operated 5465 autozone stores in the united states including puerto rico 524 stores in mexico 14 stores in brazil and 26 imc branches each autozone store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 26 2017 in 4592 of our domestic autozone stores we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in autozone stores in mexico and brazil imc branches carry an extensive line of original equipment quality import replacement parts we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories performance and replacement parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

for fiscal 2017 we achieved record net income of 1281 billion a 32 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 2530 million a 24 increase over the prior year both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we continue to make progress on our initiatives that are aimed at improving our ability to say yes to our customers more frequently drive traffic to our stores and accelerate our commercial growth 

our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs wage rates and other economic conditions given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

 

one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2017 was gas prices during fiscal 2017 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was 231 per gallon compared to 214 per gallon during fiscal 2016 we believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers’ level of disposable income with approximately 12 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 increase at the pump reduces approximately 12 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

we have also experienced accelerated pressure on wages in the united states during fiscal 2017 some of this is attributed to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities while the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures with lower unemployment rates and some specific actions taken in recent years by other retailers the regulatory changes are going to continue as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase their wages substantially over the next few years but we are still assessing to what degree these changes will impact our earnings growth in future periods 

during fiscal 2017 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our largest set of categories while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years in our domestic stores we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the failure category as compared to last year we believe the improvement in this sales category was driven by differences in regional weather patterns and improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather over a short term period over the long term we believe the impact of the weather on our sales mix is not significant 

our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment in recent years we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability in our domestic stores as part of those tests we closely studied our hub distribution model store inventory levels and product assortment which led to strategic tests on increased frequency of delivery to our domestic stores and significantly expanding parts and assortment in select domestic stores we call mega hubs during fiscal 2015 we concluded our tests on these specific new concepts during fiscal 2016 and most of fiscal 2017 we continued the implementation of more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers to additional domestic stores and the execution of our mega hub strategy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 however we made substantial changes to test different scenarios to determine the optimal approach around increased delivery frequency we expect to conclude this test in fiscal 2018 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2017 latest publicly available information miles driven in the us increased by 12 compared to the same period in the prior year 

seven year old or older vehicles 

between 2008 and 2012 new vehicle sales were significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating 

 

according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2017 the average age of vehicles on the road is 117 years as compared to 116 years as of january 1 2016 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell 

results of operations 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

for the fiscal year ended august 26 2017 we reported net sales of 10889 billion compared with 10636 billion for the year ended august 27 2016 a 24 increase from fiscal 2016 this growth was driven primarily by net sales of 1725 million from new domestic autozone stores and domestic same store sales increase of 05 domestic commercial sales increased 1109 million or 57 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2016 

at august 26 2017 we operated 5465 domestic autozone stores 524 in mexico 14 in brazil and 26 imc branches compared with 5297 domestic autozone stores 483 in mexico eight in brazil and 26 imc branches at august 27 2016 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico brazil and imc sales increase of 26 for fiscal 2017 

gross profit for fiscal 2017 was 5740 billion or 527 of net sales a 2 basis point decrease compared with 5609 billion or 527 of net sales for fiscal 2016 the slight decline in gross margin was attributable to higher supply chain costs 20 basis points associated with current year inventory initiatives partially offset by higher merchandise margins 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 increased to 3660 billion or 336 of net sales from 3548 billion or 334 of net sales for fiscal 2016 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to deleverage on occupancy costs 23 basis points and domestic store payroll driven by higher wage pressure 

interest expense net for fiscal 2017 was 1546 million compared with 1477 million during fiscal 2016 this increase was primarily due to higher borrowing levels and borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2017 were 5070 billion compared with 4860 billion for fiscal 2016 and weighted average borrowing rates were 28 for fiscal 2017 compared to 27 for fiscal 2016 

our effective income tax rate was 335 of pretax income for fiscal 2017 compared to 351 for fiscal 2016 the decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the company’s adoption of the new accounting guidance for sharebased payments which lowered the effective tax rate by 162 basis points 

net income for fiscal 2017 increased by 32 to 1281 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 83 to 4407 from 4070 in fiscal 2016 the company’s adoption of the new accounting guidance for sharebased payments increased earnings per share by 081 driven by a lower effective tax rate of 162 basis points a 108 benefit to earnings per share partially offset by a change to the dilutive outstanding shares calculations a 027 reduction to earnings per share excluding the 081 net benefit for the year from the adoption of this new standard adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 63 to 4326 we believe that adjusted diluted earnings per share provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the tax effects of option exercise activity we use adjusted diluted earnings per share to evaluate periodoverperiod operating performance because we believe it provides a more comparable measure of our continuing business by adjusting for items that are not reflective of the normal earnings of our business this measure may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

 

the impact of the fiscal 2017 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 was an increase of approximately 103 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2016 we reported net sales of 10636 billion compared with 10187 billion for the year ended august 29 2015 a 44 increase from fiscal 2015 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 24 and net sales of 1770 million from new domestic autozone stores domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2016 increased 1298 million or 71 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2015 

at august 27 2016 we operated 5297 domestic autozone stores 483 in mexico eight in brazil and 26 imc branches compared with 5141 domestic autozone stores 441 in mexico seven in brazil and 20 imc branches at august 29 2015 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico brazil and imc sales increase of 44 for fiscal 2016 

gross profit for fiscal 2016 was 5609 billion or 527 of net sales compared with 5327 billion or 523 of net sales for fiscal 2015 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives –18 basis points 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 increased to 3548 billion or 334 of net sales from 3374 billion or 331 of net sales for fiscal 2015 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher store payroll 

interest expense net for fiscal 2016 was 1477 million compared with 1504 million during fiscal 2015 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period average borrowings for fiscal 2016 were 4860 billion compared with 4520 billion for fiscal 2015 and weighted average borrowing rates were 27 for fiscal 2016 compared to 30 for fiscal 2015 

our effective income tax rate was 351 of pretax income for fiscal 2016 compared to 356 for fiscal 2015 the decrease in the effective income tax rate was driven by a discrete tax item during fiscal 2016 

net income for fiscal 2016 increased by 70 to 1241 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 130 to 4070 from 3603 in fiscal 2015 the impact of the fiscal 2016 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016 was an increase of approximately 117 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 20 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have locations throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil 

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2017 2016 and 2015 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 represented 323 of annual sales and 339 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 represented 320 of annual sales and 344 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 represented 323 of annual sales and 346 of net income

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 1571 billion in 2017 1641 billion in 2016 and 1573 billion in fiscal 2015 cash flows from operations are unfavorable compared to last year primarily due to timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by growth in net income and a decrease in pension contributions 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newlocation development program and the building of new distribution centers from the beginning of fiscal 2015 to august 26 2017 we have opened 622 new locations we opened two distribution centers in fiscal 2017 and currently have one additional distribution center under development net cash flows used in investing activities were 5536 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 5058 million in fiscal 2016 and 5679 million in fiscal 2015 we invested 5538 million in capital assets in fiscal 2017 compared to 4888 million in fiscal 2016 and 4806 million in fiscal 2015 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the building of the new distribution centers and increased investment in our existing locations we had new location openings of 215 for fiscal 2017 205 for fiscal 2016 and 202 for fiscal 2015 cash flows used in the acquisition of imc were 757 million in fiscal 2015 cash flows were also used in the purchase of other intangibles for 10 million in each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 857 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2017 1302 million in fiscal 2016 and 497 million in fiscal 2015 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 830 million in fiscal 2017 1205 million in fiscal 2016 and 464 million in fiscal 2015 

net cash used in financing activities was 9143 million in 2017 1117 billion in 2016 and 9446 million in fiscal 2015 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1072 billion for fiscal 2017 1452 billion for fiscal 2016 and 1271 billion for fiscal 2015 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 600 million for fiscal 2017 and 650 million for each of fiscal 2016 and 2015 in fiscal 2017 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 400 million senior notes due in january 2017 in fiscal 2016 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases in fiscal 2015 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 500 million 5750 senior notes due january 2015 and for the acquisition of imc we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the 300 million senior notes due in november 2015 and the 200 million senior notes due in june 2016 in 2017 we made net repayments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 424 million net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2016 and 2015 were 1499 million and 1538 million respectively 

during fiscal 2018 we expect to invest in our business at a decreased rate as compared to fiscal 2017 as fiscal 2017 included significant investment for the building of new distribution centers our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations supply chain infrastructure enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology the amount of our investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 13 2 and 10 respectively as compared to the prior year 

in addition to the building and land costs our new locations require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate in recent years we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per location many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments 

 

by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1074 at august 26 2017 1128 at august 27 2016 and 1129 at august 29 2015 the decrease from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was due to inventory growth and slowing inventory turns 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 26 2017 and august 27 2016 cash and cash equivalents of 1484 million and 781 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations 

for the fiscal year ended august 26 2017 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 299 as compared to 313 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases the decrease in roic is primarily due to the increase in average debt along with the impact of recent investments in the business currently these investments are diluting our return metrics we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

debt facilities 

on november 18 2016 we amended and restated our existing multiyear revolving credit facility the “new multiyear revolving credit agreement” by increasing the committed credit amount from 125 billion to 16 billion extending the expiration date by two years and renegotiating other terms and conditions this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to 21 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval and may include up to 200 million in letters of credit under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans base rate loans or a combination of both interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as libor plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires on november 18 2021 but we may by notice to the administrative agent make up to two requests to extend the termination date for an additional period of one year the first such request must be made no earlier than 60 days and no later than 45 days prior to november 18 2017 while the second request must be made no earlier than 60 days and no later than 45 days prior to november 18 2018 

on november 18 2016 we amended and restated our existing 364day revolving credit facility the “new 364day credit agreement” by decreasing the committed credit amount from 500 million to 400 million extending the expiration date by one year and renegotiating other terms and conditions the credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings and other shortterm unsecured bank loans under the credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans base rate loans or a combination of both interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as libor plus the applicable margin as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the credit facility the new 364day credit agreement expires on november 17 2017 but we may request an extension of the term date for 364 days no later than 45 days prior to november 17 2017 subject to bank approval in addition at least 15 days prior to november 17 2017 we have the right to convert the credit facility to a term loan for up to one year from the termination date subject to a 1 penalty 

 

as of august 26 2017 we had no outstanding borrowings under either of the revolving credit facilities and 33 million of outstanding letters of credit under the new multiyear revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit facility agreements require that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 251 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 26 2017 was 601 

as of august 26 2017 1155 billion of commercial paper borrowings and the 250 million 7125 senior notes due august 2018 were classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facilities as of august 26 2017 we had 1997 billion of availability under our 20 billion revolving credit facilities which would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing facilities 

we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 75 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the new multiyear revolving credit agreement as of august 26 2017 we had 749 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires june 2019 

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 104 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 26 2017 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis on april 18 2017 we issued 600 million in 3750 senior notes due june 2027 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 15 2015 the “2015 shelf registration” the 2015 shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount of debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new location openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes 

on april 21 2016 we issued 400 million in 3125 senior notes due april 2026 and 250 million in 1625 senior notes due april 2019 under the 2015 shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes 

on april 29 2015 we issued 400 million in 3250 senior notes due april 2025 and 250 million in 2500 senior notes due april 2021 under the 2015 shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 500 million in 5750 senior notes due in january 2015 and for general corporate purposes 

all senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the senior notes are downgraded as defined in the agreements further the senior notes contain a provision that repayment of the senior notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facilities covenants include restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 26 2017 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

for the fiscal year ended august 26 2017 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 261 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to 

 

ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels to the extent ebitdar continues to grow in future years we expect our debt levels to increase conversely if ebitdar declines we would expect our debt levels to decrease refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on march 21 2017 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 179 billion to 1865 billion from january 1998 to august 26 2017 we have repurchased a total of 1423 million shares at an aggregate cost of 17826 billion we repurchased 15 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1072 billion during fiscal 2017 19 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1452 billion during fiscal 2016 and 20 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1271 billion during fiscal 2015 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 26 2017 we had 8237 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

for the fiscal year ended august 26 2017 cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was 1018 billion as compared to 1167 billion during the comparable prior year period cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less increases in debt plus share repurchases we use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available in an effort to increase shareholder value in the form of share repurchases we believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings if we allowed these funds to accumulate on our balance sheet instead of repurchasing our shares we believe our earnings per share and stock price would be negatively impacted refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

subsequent to august 26 2017 we have repurchased 383165 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2258 million considering the cumulative repurchases subsequent to august 26 2017 we have 5979 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

 

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 26 2017 

 

  

     we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account during fiscal 2017 we made contributions of 178 million to the pension plan we expect to make contributions of approximately 203 million during fiscal 2018 however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets 

as of august 26 2017 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 3147 million and our pension assets are valued at 3163 million resulting in a net pension asset position of 15 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 1189 million at august 26 2017 the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 

additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 154 million at august 26 2017 approximately 26 million is classified as current liabilities and 128 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the longterm liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 26 2017 

 

 a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers 

 

there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

 recent accounting pronouncements 

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions 

 

our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market inventory cost has been determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic inventories and the weighted average cost method for mexico and brazil inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases we have exhausted our lifo reserve balance our policy is to not write up inventory in excess of replacement cost which is based on average cost the difference between lifo cost and replacement cost which will be reduced upon experiencing price inflation on our merchandise purchases was 4149 million at august 26 2017 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 3 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results from physical inventory counts to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate shrink loss as a percent of sales 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 26 2017 would have affected net income by approximately 67 million in fiscal 2017 

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 81 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and typically have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 1 million in each of the last three years 

 

goodwill and intangibles 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting unit’s fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates 

the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles at august 26 2017 and august 27 2016 was 4188 million with 3026 million related to our domestic auto parts reporting unit 898 million relating to our autoanything reporting unit and 264 million relating to our interamerican motor corporation reporting unit no impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded our carrying values if profitability trends do not improve as projected during fiscal 2018 for our autoanything and interamerican motor corporation reporting units it is possible that an interim test or our annual impairment test may result in an impairment of these assets 

selfinsurance reserves 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2205 million at august 26 2017 and 2144 million at august 27 2016 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 147 million for fiscal 2017 

 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 21 million for fiscal 2017 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 26 2017 we had approximately 154 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels or additional years of service but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 26 2017 we have assumed a 70 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets in january 2017 our investment committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the pension plan based on the revised asset allocation target the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changed from 70 for the year ended august 26 2017 to 60 for the year ending august 25 2018 at august 26 2017 our plan assets totaled 3163 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on such date on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 16 million for the qualified plan 

 

discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities for fiscal 2017 we assumed a discount rate of 39 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 26 2017 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 17 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 5171 billion as of august 26 2017 and 5117 billion as of august 27 2016 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 903 million and 1927 million at august 26 2017 and august 27 2016 respectively we had 1155 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 26 2017 and 1198 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 27 2016 in fiscal 2017 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 116 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 3926 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 239 million at august 26 2017 and 3727 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 234 million at august 27 2016 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1913 million at august 26 2017 

fuel price risk 

from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment in fiscal 2015 we entered into a fuel swap to economically hedge the commodity cost associated with our unleaded fuel usage the notional amount of the contract was 29 million gallons and terminated march 31 2015 the swap had no significant impact on the results of operations we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2017 or 2016 

 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 5193 million at august 26 2017 and 3980 million at august 27 2016 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso increased by approximately 4 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2017 and decreased by approximately 9 during fiscal 2016 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 26 2017 and august 27 2016 would be approximately 472 million and approximately 362 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

at august 27 2016 our autozone stores and imc branches were in the following locations 

 

  

 marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as identifying any associated warranties that are offered by us or our vendors we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business additionally we offer smartphone apps that provide customers with store locations driving directions operating hours ability to purchase products and product availability 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators and batteries 

 

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

 we believe that the satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes the valucraft autozone surebilt proelite duralast duralast max duralast gold duralast platinum and duralast propower brands we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors 

brand marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty card programs primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 

 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico and mexico as a part of the domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized training manuals and computer based modules and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all domestic autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico sao paulo brazil and canoga park california we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our autozone stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen 

our autozone stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

 

store development 

the following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years 

 

  

 we believe that expansion opportunities exist in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new autozone store or imc branch are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations for autozone stores and imc branches include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we seek to open new autozone stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time when selecting future sites and market locations for our imc branches we look for locations close to major highways to support imc’s delivery schedule and also consider the population of autozone stores in the market in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all autozone stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil merchandise is selected and purchased for all imc branches through our store support center located in canoga park california in fiscal 2016 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 11 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied approximately 10 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our autozone stores and imc branches by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

we ended fiscal 2016 with 182 hub stores which have a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment 

during fiscal 2014 and 2015 we tested two new concepts of our supply chain strategy increased delivery frequency to our stores utilizing our distribution centers and significantly expanded parts assortments in select stores we call mega hubs our tests were concluded during fiscal 2015 and both initiatives were expanded to additional locations in fiscal 2016 

increased delivery frequency focuses on improving our instock position of our core storestocked product by providing deliveries to certain stores multiple times per week we ended fiscal 2016 with over 1900 stores receiving deliveries multiple times per week an increase of approximately 1000 stores since fiscal 2015 

 

a mega hub store carries inventory of 80000 to 100000 unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis we ended fiscal 2016 with 11 mega hubs an increase of six since fiscal 2015 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty store layouts location and convenience and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including 

 

  

  

  

  

 for the long term demand for our products may be affected by 

 

  

  

 all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing locations autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising with the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors’ increased focus on optimizing customers’ online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

we have increased our location count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4813 locations at august 27 2011 to 5814 locations at august 27 2016 an average location increase per year of 4 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 8073 billion in fiscal 2011 to 10636 billion in fiscal 2016 an average increase per year of 6 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new locations and commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new locations only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by the economic pressures mentioned above we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open locations at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

recently some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket chains have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue securities 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in recent years resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in recent years there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in recent years will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

 

significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has remained relatively slow during the past five years however towards the end of fiscal 2015 and continuing through fiscal 2016 the unemployment rate has improved to prerecession levels moreover the united states government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures significant geopolitical conflicts continued volatility in energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs over the short term such factors could positively impact our business over a longer period of time all of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 84000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata autoanything and imc our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment laws andor regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at favorable prices and payment terms if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses resulting in increased product costs and difficulties in meeting our inventory demands if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

we directly imported approximately 10 of our purchases measured at cost in fiscal 2016 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers’ failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and 

 

cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability in addition the united states’ foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports also will increase 

our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the location management level and the integration of new locations into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain and global sourcing initiative do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increase our costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if a customer has a bad experience and shares it over social media 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations the inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

 

our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets 

the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance 

failure to protect the privacy and security of customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs 

our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers’ suppliers’ employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in additional costs 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations 

business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes floods and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in 2004 we acquired a store site in mount ephraim new jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property we have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the njdep has asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 and again in an amended directive and notice to insurers dated january 13 2014 collectively the “directives” that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory by letter dated april 23 2015 njdep has demanded payment from us and other parties in the amount of approximately 296 thousand for costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property by letter dated january 29 2016 we were informed that njdep has filed a lien against the property in connection with approximately 355 thousand in costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property we have contested and will continue to contest any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the directives and the april 23 2015 demand in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work and the state is considering the request although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow

in april 2016 we received a letter from the california air resources board seeking payment for alleged violations of the california health and safety code related to the sale of certain aftermarket emission parts in the state of california we do not believe that any resolution of the matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices we do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 27 2016 operated 5297 autozone stores in the united states including puerto rico 483 stores in mexico eight stores in brazil and 26 imc branches each autozone store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 27 2016 in 4390 of our domestic autozone stores we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in autozone stores in mexico and brazil imc branches carry an extensive line of original equipment quality import replacement parts we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories performance and replacement parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2016 delivering record net income of 1241 billion a 70 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 4483 million a 44 increase over the prior year both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we continue to build our internal sales force and refine our parts assortment 

our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates and other economic conditions given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2016 was gas prices during fiscal 2016 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was 214 per gallon compared to 269 per gallon during fiscal 2015 we believe reduced gas prices gave our customers additional disposable income with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

during fiscal 2016 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our largest set of categories while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years in our domestic stores we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the failure and discretionary categories as compared to last year we believe the improvement in these sales categories was driven by 

 

differences in regional weather patterns improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year and lower gas prices our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather over a short term period over the long term we believe the impact of the weather on our sales mix is not significant 

our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment in recent years we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability in our domestic stores as part of those tests we closely studied our hub distribution model store inventory levels and product assortment which led to strategic tests on increased frequency of delivery to our domestic stores and significantly expanding parts assortment in select domestic stores we call mega hubs during fiscal 2015 we concluded our tests on these specific new concepts and continued to roll out these strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 during fiscal 2016 we continued the implementation of more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers to additional domestic stores and the execution of our mega hub strategy we expect to continue this effort in fiscal 2017 and beyond 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2016 latest publicly available information miles driven increased compared to the same period last year 

seven year old or older vehicles 

between 2008 and 2012 new vehicle sales were significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2016 the average age of vehicles on the road is 116 years as compared to 115 years as of january 1 2015 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell 

results of operations 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2016 we reported net sales of 10636 billion compared with 10187 billion for the year ended august 29 2015 a 44 increase from fiscal 2015 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 24 and net sales of 1770 million from new domestic autozone stores domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2016 increased 1298 million or 71 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2015 

at august 27 2016 we operated 5297 domestic autozone stores 483 stores in mexico eight stores in brazil and 26 imc branches compared with 5141 domestic autozone stores 441 stores in mexico seven stores in brazil and 20 imc branches at august 29 2015 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico brazil and imc sales increase of 44 for fiscal 2016 

gross profit for fiscal 2016 was 5609 billion or 527 of net sales compared with 5327 billion or 523 of net sales for fiscal 2015 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives –18 basis points 

 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 increased to 3548 billion or 334 of net sales from 3374 billion or 331 of net sales for fiscal 2015 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher store payroll 

interest expense net for fiscal 2016 was 1477 million compared with 1504 million during fiscal 2015 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period average borrowings for fiscal 2016 were 4860 billion compared with 4520 billion for fiscal 2015 and weighted average borrowing rates were 27 for fiscal 2016 compared to 30 for fiscal 2015 

our effective income tax rate was 351 of pretax income for fiscal 2016 compared to 356 for fiscal 2015 the decrease in the effective income tax rate was driven by a discrete tax item during fiscal 2016 

net income for fiscal 2016 increased by 70 to 1241 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 130 to 4070 from 3603 in fiscal 2015 the impact of the fiscal 2016 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016 was an increase of approximately 117 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 we reported net sales of 10187 billion compared with 9475 billion for the year ended august 30 2014 a 75 increase from fiscal 2014 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 38 net sales of 1851 million from new domestic autozone stores and the inclusion of imc sales domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2015 increased 2084 million or 129 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2014

gross profit for fiscal 2015 was 5327 billion or 523 of net sales compared with 4935 billion or 521 of net sales for fiscal 2014 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins partially offset by the impact of the imc acquisition finalized during september 2014 –25 basis points and higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives –13 basis points 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 increased to 3374 billion or 331 of net sales from 3105 billion or 328 of net sales for fiscal 2014 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher legal costs –14 basis points and the impact of imc –13 basis points 

interest expense net for fiscal 2015 was 1504 million compared with 1675 million during fiscal 2014 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period average borrowings for fiscal 2015 were 4520 billion compared with 4252 billion for fiscal 2014 and weighted average borrowing rates were 30 for fiscal 2015 compared to 36 for fiscal 2014 

our effective income tax rate was 356 of pretax income for fiscal 2015 compared to 357 for fiscal 2014 

net income for fiscal 2015 increased by 85 to 1160 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 141 to 3603 from 3157 in fiscal 2014 the impact of the fiscal 2015 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015 was an increase of approximately 101 

 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 20 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have locations throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil 

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2016 2015 and 2014 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 represented 320 of annual sales and 344 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 represented 323 of annual sales and 346 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 represented 322 of annual sales and 349 of net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 1577 billion in 2016 1525 billion in 2015 and 1341 billion in fiscal 2014 cash flows from operations are favorable to last year primarily due to the growth in net income partially offset by an increase in pension contributions 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newlocation development program from the beginning of fiscal 2014 to august 27 2016 we have opened 597 new locations net cash flows used in investing activities were 5058 million compared to 5679 million in fiscal 2015 and 4480 million in fiscal 2014 we invested 4888 million in capital assets in fiscal 2016 compared to 4806 million in fiscal 2015 and 4381 million in fiscal 2014 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of locations opened and increased investment in our existing locations we had new location openings of 205 for fiscal 2016 202 for fiscal 2015 and 190 for fiscal 2014 cash flows used in the acquisition of imc were 757 million in fiscal 2015 cash flows were also used in the purchase of other intangibles for 10 million in each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2014 cash flows were used to purchase intangibles for 111 million we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 1302 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2016 and 497 million in each of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 1205 million in fiscal 2016 464 million in fiscal 2015 and 468 million in fiscal 2014

during fiscal 2017 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2016 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations supply chain infrastructure enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology the amount of our investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 2 10 and 6 respectively as compared to the prior year 

in addition to the building and land costs our new locations require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate in recent years we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per location many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1128 at august 27 2016 1129 at august 29 2015 and 1149 at august 30 2014 the decrease from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was driven by the inclusion of imc in fiscal 2015 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 27 2016 and august 29 2015 cash and cash equivalents of 781 million and 649 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations 

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2016 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 313 as compared to 312 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

debt facilities 

on december 19 2014 we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility the “multiyear credit agreement” by increasing the amount of capital leases allowable to 225 million extending the expiration date by two years and renegotiating other terms and conditions this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility is 125 billion and may be increased to 15 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 225 million in capital leases each fiscal year under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as libor plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in december 2019 

on december 19 2014 we entered into a new revolving credit facility the “364day credit agreement” the credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the 364day credit agreement provides for loans in the principal amount of up to 500 million under the credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans base rate loans or a combination of both 

 

interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as libor plus the applicable margin as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the credit facility the original expiration date of the credit facility was december 19 2015 but in accordance with the credit agreement in november 2015 we requested and the banks approved the extension of the termination date to december 16 2016 in addition at least 15 days prior to december 16 2016 we have the right to convert the credit facility to a term loan for up to one year from the termination date subject to a 1 penalty 

as of august 27 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings under either of the revolving credit facilities and 33 million of outstanding letters of credit under the multiyear credit agreement 

the revolving credit facility agreements require that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 251 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 27 2016 was 551 

as of august 27 2016 1198 billion of commercial paper borrowings and the 400 million 1300 notes due january 2017 are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facilities as of august 27 2016 we had 1708 billion of availability under our 175 billion revolving credit facilities which would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing facilities 

we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the multiyear credit agreement in fiscal 2016 we amended our existing letter of credit facility to decrease the amount that can be requested in letters of credit from 100 million to 75 million effective june 2016 this amendment also extended the maturity date from june 2016 to june 2019 as of august 27 2016 we had 749 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility 

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 279 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 27 2016 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis 

on april 21 2016 we issued 400 million in 3125 senior notes due april 2026 and 250 million in 1625 senior notes due april 2019 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 15 2015 the “2015 shelf registration” the 2015 shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new location openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes 

on april 29 2015 we issued 400 million in 3250 senior notes due april 2025 and 250 million in 2500 senior notes due april 2021 under the 2015 shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 500 million in 5750 senior notes due in january 2015 and for general corporate purposes 

on january 14 2014 we issued 400 million in 1300 senior notes due january 2017 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17 2012 proceeds from the debt issuance on january 14 2014 were used to repay a portion of the 500 million in 6500 senior notes due january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 6500 senior notes 

 

the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the “notes” are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded further all senior notes contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facilities covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 27 2016 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2016 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 251 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels refer to the “reconciliation of nongaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on march 22 2016 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 164 billion to 1715 billion from january 1998 to august 27 2016 we have repurchased a total of 1408 million shares at an aggregate cost of 16755 billion we repurchased 19 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1452 billion during fiscal 2016 20 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1271 billion during fiscal 2015 and 22 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1099 billion during fiscal 2014 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 27 2016 we had 3954 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

on september 22 2016 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million this brings the total value of shares authorized to 179 billion subsequent to august 27 2016 we have repurchased 390473 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2976 million considering the cumulative repurchases and the increase in authorization subsequent to august 27 2016 we have 8477 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

 

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 27 2016 

 

  

     we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account during fiscal 2016 we made contributions of 527 million to the pension plan we expect to make contributions of approximately 178 million during fiscal 2017 however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets 

as of august 27 2016 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 3285 million and our pension assets are valued at 2894 million resulting in a net pension obligation of 391 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 1459 million at august 27 2016 the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 

additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 258 million at august 27 2016 approximately 49 million is classified as current liabilities and 209 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the longterm liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 27 2016 

 

 a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

 recent accounting pronouncements 

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market inventory cost has been determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic inventories and the weighted average cost method for mexico and brazil inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases we have exhausted our lifo reserve balance our policy is not to write up inventory in excess of replacement cost which is based on average cost the difference between lifo cost and replacement cost which will be reduced upon experiencing price inflation on our merchandise purchases was 3641 million at august 27 2016 

 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 3 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results from physical inventory counts to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate shrink loss as a percent of sales 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 27 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 62 million in fiscal 2016 

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 150 thousand in each of the last three years 

goodwill and intangibles 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting unit’s fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

 

indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates 

the carrying value of goodwill at august 27 2016 and august 29 2015 was 3919 million no impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 

selfinsurance reserves 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2144 million at august 27 2016 and 2053 million at august 29 2015 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 139 million for fiscal 2016 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 21 million for fiscal 2016 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 27 2016 we had approximately 258 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 27 2016 we have assumed a 70 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets in august 2014 our investment committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the pension plan based on the revised asset allocation target the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changed from 75 for the year ended august 30 2014 to 70 for the years ending august 29 2015 and august 27 2016 at august 27 2016 our plan assets totaled 2894 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on such date on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 14 million for the qualified plan 

discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities for fiscal 2016 we assumed a discount rate of 37 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 27 2016 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 18 million for the qualified plan and 24 thousand for the nonqualified plan 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 5117 billion as of august 27 2016 and 4696 billion as of august 29 2015 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 1927 million and 707 million at august 27 2016 and august 29 2015 respectively we had 1198 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 27 2016 and 1048 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 29 2015 in fiscal 2016 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 120 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding debt of 3727 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 234 million at august 27 2016 and 3577 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 227 million at august 29 2015 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1789 million at august 27 2016 

fuel price risk 

from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment in fiscal 2015 we entered into a fuel swap to economically hedge the commodity cost associated with our unleaded fuel usage the notional amount of the contract was 29 million gallons and terminated march 31 2015 the swap had no significant impact on the results of operations we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2016 or 2014 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 

 

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 3980 million at august 27 2016 and 3667 million at august 29 2015 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 9 against the us dollar during fiscal 2016 and decreased by approximately 29 during fiscal 2015 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 27 2016 and august 29 2015 would be approximately 362 million and approximately 333 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

introduction 

autozone inc “autozone” the “company” “we” “our” or “us” is the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 29 2015 operated 5141 autozone stores in the united states including puerto rico 441 stores in mexico seven stores in brazil and 20 interamerican motor corporation “imc” branches each autozone store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 29 2015 in 4141 of our domestic autozone stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in select stores in mexico and brazil imc branches carry an extensive line of original equipment quality import replacement parts we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories and performance parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

at august 29 2015 our autozone stores and imc branches were in the following locations 

 

  

 marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as identifying any associated warranties that are offered by us or our vendors we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business additionally we offer smartphone apps that provide customers with store locations driving directions operating hours ability to purchase products and product availability 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators and batteries 

 

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

 we believe that the satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes the valucraft autozone surebilt proelite duralast duralast gold duralast platinum and duralast propower brands we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors 

brand marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty card programs primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico and mexico as a part of the domestic store program we 

 

offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized training manuals and computer based modules and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all domestic autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico sao paulo brazil and canoga park california we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our autozone stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen 

our autozone stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

 

store development 

the following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years 

 

  

 we believe that expansion opportunities exist in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new autozone store or imc branch are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations for autozone stores and imc branches include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we seek to open new autozone stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time when selecting future sites and market locations for our imc branches we look for locations close to major highways to support imc’s delivery schedule and also consider the population of autozone stores in the market in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all autozone stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil merchandise is selected and purchased for all imc branches through our store support center located in canoga park california in fiscal 2015 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 11 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied approximately 11 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

during fiscal 2014 and 2015 we tested two specific new concepts of our supply chain strategy increased frequency of delivery to our stores and significantly expanded parts assortments in select stores we call mega hubs a mega hub store carries inventory of 80000 to 100000 unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis as part of these tests we have incorporated more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers to a group of test stores our tests were concluded during fiscal 2015 and both initiatives are expected to be expanded to additional locations in fiscal 2016 and beyond 

 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty store layouts location and convenience and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks 

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “duralast platinum” “duralast propower” “duralast propower plus” “duralast propower ultra” “duralast propower agm” “valucraft” “proelite” “surebilt” “alldata” “autoanything” “imc” “loanatool” and “znet” we believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing and merchandising strategies 

employees 

as of august 29 2015 we employed over 81000 persons approximately 58 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 91 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 5 percent in distribution centers and approximately 4 percent in store support and other functions included in the above numbers are approximately 6600 persons employed in our mexico and brazil operations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including 

 

  

  

  

  

 for the long term demand for our products may be affected by 

 

  

  

 all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing locations autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising with the increasing use of digital tools and social media our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

we have increased our location count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4627 locations at august 28 2010 to 5609 locations at august 29 2015 an average store location increase per year of 4 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 7363 billion in fiscal 2010 to 10187 billion in fiscal 2015 an average increase per year of 8 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new locations and commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new locations only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by the economic pressures mentioned above we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open locations at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

recently some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

 

a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue securities 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in recent years resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in recent years there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in recent years will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has remained relatively slow during the past five years however towards the end of fiscal 2015 the unemployment rate has improved to prerecession levels moreover the united states government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures significant geopolitical conflicts continued volatility in energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs over the short term such factors could positively impact our business over a longer period of time all of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 81000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata autoanything and imc our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment laws andor regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses and meet our inventory demands if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the location management level and the integration of new locations into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if a customer has a bad experience and shares it over social media 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating 

 

expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations the inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets 

the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy 

in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance 

failure to protect the privacy and security of customers’ suppliers’ autozoners’ or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs 

our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers’ suppliers’ employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in additional costs 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in 2004 we acquired a store site in mount ephraim new jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property we have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the new jersey department of environmental protection “njdep” has asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 and again in an amended directive and notice to insurers dated january 13 2014 collectively the “directives” that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory by letter dated april 23 2015 njdep has demanded payment from us and other parties in the amount of approximately 296 thousand for costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property we have contested and will continue to contest any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the directives and the april 23 2015 demand in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe it should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work and the state is considering the request although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

in july 2014 we received a subpoena from the district attorney of the county of alameda along with other environmental prosecutorial offices in the state of california seeking documents and information related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste we are cooperating fully with the request and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these efforts 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices we do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 29 2015 operated 5141 autozone stores in the united states including puerto rico 441 stores in mexico seven stores in brazil and 20 imc branches each autozone store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 29 2015 in 4141 of our domestic autozone stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in select autozone stores in mexico and brazil imc branches carry an extensive line of original equipment quality import replacement parts we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories and performance parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2015 delivering record net income of 1160 billion an 85 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 7120 million a 75 increase over the prior year we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and refine our parts assortment 

our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates and other economic conditions given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2015 was gas prices during fiscal 2015 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was 269 per gallon compared to 348 per gallon during fiscal 2014 we believe reduced gas prices gave our customers additional disposable income with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

 

during fiscal 2015 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the failure related categories we believe the increase in failure related products is largely due to increased miles driven and favorable weather related impacts in various regions of the us 

our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment specifically during fiscal 2014 and 2015 we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment and performed strategic tests on increased frequency of delivery to our stores and significantly expanding parts assortments in select stores during fiscal 2015 we concluded our tests on these specific new concepts and have plans to continue to roll out these strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 and beyond 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2015 latest publicly available information miles driven increased compared to the same period last year 

seven year old or older vehicles 

between 2008 and 2012 new vehicle sales were significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2015 the average age of vehicles on the road is 115 years as compared to 114 years as of january 1 2014 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell 

effective september 27 2014 we acquired the outstanding stock of interamerican motor corporation imc the second largest distributor of quality import replacement parts in the united states for 757 million net of cash imc specializes in parts coverage for european and asian cars with this acquisition we expect to grow our share in the aftermarket import car parts market the results of operations from imc have been included in our auto parts locations business activities since the date of acquisition 

results of operations 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 we reported net sales of 10187 billion compared with 9475 billion for the year ended august 30 2014 a 75 increase from fiscal 2014 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 38 net sales of 1851 million from new stores and the inclusion of imc sales 

 

at august 29 2015 we operated 5141 domestic autozone stores 441 stores in mexico seven stores in brazil and 20 imc branches compared with 4984 domestic autozone stores 402 stores in mexico and five stores in brazil at august 30 2014 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico brazil and imc sales increase of 76 for fiscal 2015 

gross profit for fiscal 2015 was 5327 billion or 523 of net sales compared with 4935 billion or 521 of net sales for fiscal 2014 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins partially offset by the impact of the imc acquisition finalized during september 2014 25 basis points and higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives 13 basis points 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 increased to 3374 billion or 331 of net sales from 3105 billion or 328 of net sales for fiscal 2014 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher legal costs 14 basis points and the impact of imc 13 basis points 

interest expense net for fiscal 2015 was 1504 million compared with 1675 million during fiscal 2014 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period average borrowings for fiscal 2015 were 4520 billion compared with 4252 billion for fiscal 2014 and weighted average borrowing rates were 30 for fiscal 2015 compared to 36 for fiscal 2014 

our effective income tax rate was 356 of pretax income for fiscal 2015 compared to 357 for fiscal 2014 

net income for fiscal 2015 increased by 85 to 1160 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 141 to 3603 from 3157 in fiscal 2014 the impact of the fiscal 2015 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015 was an increase of approximately 101 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 we reported net sales of 9475 billion compared with 9148 billion for the year ended august 31 2013 a 36 increase from fiscal 2013 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 28 and net sales of 1659 million comprised of sales from new stores excluding the 53rd week in fiscal 2013 sales increased 56 

at august 30 2014 we operated 4984 domestic autozone stores 402 stores in mexico and five stores in brazil compared with 4836 domestic autozone stores 362 stores in mexico and three stores in brazil at august 31 2013 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico and brazil sales increase of 31 for fiscal 2014 excluding the 53rd week in fiscal 2013 total auto parts sales increased 51 

gross profit for fiscal 2014 was 4935 billion or 521 of net sales compared with 4741 billion or 518 of net sales for fiscal 2013 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs and lower shrink expense partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives 17 basis points 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 increased to 3105 billion or 328 of net sales from 2968 billion or 324 of net sales for fiscal 2013 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher store payroll 11 basis points and planned information system investments 10 basis points 

interest expense net for fiscal 2014 was 1675 million compared with 1854 million during fiscal 2013 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period average borrowings for fiscal 2014 were 4274 billion compared with 3927 billion for fiscal 2013 and weighted average borrowing rates were 36 for fiscal 2014 compared to 45 for fiscal 2013 

 

our effective income tax rate was 357 of pretax income for fiscal 2014 compared to 360 for fiscal 2013 

net income for fiscal 2014 increased by 52 to 1070 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 136 to 3157 from 2779 in fiscal 2013 the impact of the fiscal 2014 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 was an increase of approximately 104 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 20 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil 

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2015 and 2014 and 17 weeks in 2013 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 represented 323 of annual sales and 346 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 represented 322 of annual sales and 349 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 represented 338 of annual sales and 365 of net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 1525 billion in 2015 1341 billion in fiscal 2014 and 1415 billion in fiscal 2013 cash flows from operations are favorable to last year due to the growth in net income and the timing of income tax deductions 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newlocation development program from the beginning of fiscal 2013 to august 29 2015 we have opened 589 new locations net cash flows used in investing activities were 5679 million compared to 4480 million in fiscal 2014 and 5273 million in fiscal 2013 we invested 4806 million in capital assets in fiscal 2015 compared to 4381 million in fiscal 2014 and 4145 million in fiscal 2013 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of locations opened increased investment in our existing locations and the acquisition of imc new location openings were 202 for fiscal 2015 190 for fiscal 2014 and 197 for fiscal 2013 cash flows used in the acquisition of imc were 757 million in fiscal 2015 cash flows were also used in the purchase of other intangibles for 10 million in the same period in fiscal 2014 cash flows were used to purchase intangibles for 111 million cash flows used in the acquisition of autoanything were 1161 million during fiscal 2013 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 497 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2015 497 million in fiscal 2014 and 445 million in fiscal 2013 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 464 million in fiscal 2015 468 million in fiscal 2014 and 379 million in fiscal 2013 

net cash used in financing activities was 8967 million in 2015 9116 million in fiscal 2014 and 8470 million in fiscal 2013 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1271 billion for fiscal 2015 1099 billion for fiscal 2014 and 1387 billion for fiscal 2013 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 650 million for fiscal 2015 400 million for fiscal 2014 and 800 million for fiscal 2013 in fiscal 2015 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 500 million in 5750 senior notes due in january 2015 and for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases proceeds from the issuance of debt in 

 

fiscal 2015 were also used for the acquisition of imc in fiscal 2014 the proceeds from the issuance of debt was used for the repayment of a portion of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 in fiscal 2013 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes and the acquisition of autoanything in fiscal 2013 we repaid our 200 million senior notes due in june 2013 and our 300 million senior notes due in october 2012 using commercial paper borrowings in 2015 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 1538 million net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2014 and 2013 were 2568 million and 1187 million respectively 

during fiscal 2016 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2015 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations supply chain infrastructure enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology the amount of our investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2015 2014 and fiscal 2013 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 10 6 and 10 respectively as compared to the prior year 

in addition to the building and land costs our new locations require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio during fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per location many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1129 at august 29 2015 1149 at august 30 2014 and 1156 at august 31 2013 the decrease from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was driven by the inclusion of imc we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 29 2015 and august 30 2014 cash and cash equivalents of 649 million and 193 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations 

for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 312 as compared to 321 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases the decrease in roic is primarily due to the increase in average debt along with the impact of recent investments in the business the return on these investments is currently diluting our operating margins we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance 

 

debt facilities 

on december 19 2014 we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility the “multiyear credit agreement” by increasing the amount of capital leases allowable to 225 million extending the expiration date by two years and renegotiating other terms and conditions this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility is 125 billion and may be increased to 15 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 225 million in capital leases each fiscal year under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as libor plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in december 2019

on april 29 2015 we issued 400 million in 3250 notes due april 2025 and 250 million in 2500 notes due april 2021 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 15 2015 the “new shelf registration” the new shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new location openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 500 million in 5750 senior notes due in january 2015 and for general corporate purposes 

 

on january 14 2014 we issued 400 million in 1300 notes due january 2017 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17 2012 the “shelf registration” proceeds from the debt issuance on january 14 2014 were used to repay a portion of the 500 million in 6500 senior notes due january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 6500 senior notes 

on april 29 2013 we issued 500 million in 3125 senior notes due july 2023 under its shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on april 29 2013 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 200 million in 4375 senior notes due june 2013 and for general corporate purposes 

on november 13 2012 we issued 300 million in 2875 senior notes due january 2023 under the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on november 13 2012 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 300 million in 5875 senior notes due in october 2012 and for general corporate purposes 

the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the “notes” are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded further all senior notes issued since august 2008 contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 29 2015 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 251 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on march 24 2015 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 149 billion to 1565 billion from january 1998 to august 29 2015 we have repurchased a total of 1389 million shares at an aggregate cost of 15302 billion we repurchased 20 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1271 billion during fiscal 2015 22 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1099 billion during fiscal 2014 and 35 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1387 billion during fiscal 2013 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 29 2015 we have 3478 million remaining under the board of director’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

on october 7 2015 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 1565 billion to 164 billion subsequent to august 29 2015 we have repurchased 356993 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2599 million considering the cumulative repurchases and the increase in authorization subsequent to august 29 2015 we have 8379 million remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase its common stock 

 

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 29 2015 

 

  

     we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account during fiscal 2015 we made contributions of 171 million to the pension plan we expect to make contributions of approximately 63 million during fiscal 2016 however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets 

as of august 29 2015 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 2961 million and our pension assets are valued at 2388 million resulting in a net pension obligation of 574 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 1167 million at august 29 2015 the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 

additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 285 million at august 29 2015 approximately 19 million is classified as current liabilities and 266 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the longterm liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 29 2015 

 

 a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

  recent accounting pronouncements 

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out “fifo” method for mexico and brazil inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 3326 million at august 29 2015 calculated using the dollar value method 

 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 3 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 29 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 61 million in fiscal 2015 

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 150 thousand in each of the last three years 

goodwill and intangibles 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting unit’s fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset 

 

exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates 

the carrying value of goodwill at august 29 2015 and august 30 2014 was 3919 million and 3678 million respectively during fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an 183 million goodwill impairment charge in our other business activities related to the goodwill of autoanything and a 41 million impairment charge to autoanything’s trade name the 41 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of 246 million at august 31 2013 we also determined autoanything was not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of 233 million to the contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at august 31 2013 no impairment charges were recognized in our other business activities in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 no impairment charges were recognized in the auto parts stores reporting segment during fiscal 2015 or in previous fiscal years 

selfinsurance reserves 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2053 million at august 29 2015 and 1951 million at august 30 2014 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 132 million for fiscal 2015 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 20 million for fiscal 2015 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing 

 

interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 29 2015 we had approximately 285 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 we have assumed a 70 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets in august 2014 our investment committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the pension plan based on the revised asset allocation target the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changed from 75 for the year ended august 30 2014 to 70 for the year ended august 29 2015 at august 29 2015 our plan assets totaled 2388 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 12 million for the qualified plan 

discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2015 we assumed a discount rate of 45 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 29 2015 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 19 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 4696 billion as of august 29 2015 and 4480 billion as of august 30 2014 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 707 million and 1573 million at august 29 2015 and august 30 2014 respectively we had 1048 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 29 2015 and 8938 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 30 2014 in fiscal 2015 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 105 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding debt of 3577 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 227 million at august 29 2015 and 3429 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 207 million at august 30 2014 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1601 million at august 29 2015 

fuel price risk 

from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment in fiscal 2015 we entered into a fuel swap to economically hedge the commodity cost associated with our unleaded fuel usage the notional amount of the contract was 29 million gallons and terminated march 31 2015 the swap had no significant impact on the results of operations we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 

we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars

 

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 3667 million at august 29 2015 and 4392 million at august 30 2014 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 29 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2015 and increased by approximately 19 during fiscal 2014 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 29 2015 and august 30 2014 would be approximately 333 million and approximately 399 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico and mexico as a part of the domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

 

store development 

the following table reflects our store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

 we believe that expansion opportunities exist in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil in fiscal 2014 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 10 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied more than 10 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty store layouts location and convenience and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks

employees 

as of august 30 2014 we employed over 76000 persons approximately 57 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 92 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 5 percent in distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support and other functions included in the above numbers are approximately 5700 persons employed in our mexico and brazil operations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected 

demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including 

 

  

  

  

  

 for the long term demand for our products may be affected by 

 

  

  

 all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout 

 

location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising with the increasing use of digital tools and social media our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4417 stores at august 29 2009 to 5391 stores at august 30 2014 an average store count increase per year of 4 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 6817 billion in fiscal 2009 to 9475 billion in fiscal 2014 an average increase per year of 8 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by the economic pressures mentioned above we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

recently some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue securities 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in calendar years 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009 there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has remained relatively slow during the past five years and the unemployment rate has not recovered to prerecession levels moreover the united states government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures significant geopolitical conflicts continued high energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs over the short term such factors could positively impact our business over a longer period of time all of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 76000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata and autoanything we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses and meet our inventory demands if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize hub stores our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our stores which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if a customer has a bad experience and shares it over social media 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

failure to protect the privacy and security of customers’ autozoners’ or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs 

our business involves the storage and transmission of personal information about our customers and autozoners failure to protect the security of our customers’ employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and our reputation could suffer while we take significant steps to protect customer employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards our security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data 

 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our stores being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers 

we rely heavily on our computer systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in 2004 we acquired a store site in mount ephraim new jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the 

 

property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property we are also investigating and will be addressing potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the new jersey department of environmental protection has asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 and again in an amended directive and notice to insurers dated january 13 2014 collectively the “directives” that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory we have contested any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the directives in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work and the state is considering the request although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

in july 2014 we received a subpoena from the district attorney of the county of alameda along with other environmental prosecutorial offices in the state of california seeking documents and information related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste we are cooperating fully with the request and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these efforts 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices we do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 30 2014 operated 4984 stores in the united states including puerto rico 402 stores in mexico and five stores in brazil each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 30 2014 in 3845 of our domestic stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in select stores in mexico and brazil we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories and performance parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2014 delivering record net income of 1070 billion a 52 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 3278 million a 36 increase over the prior year we completed the year with growth in all areas of our business we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and refine our parts assortment over the past several years various factors have occurred within the economy that affects both our consumer and our industry including continued high unemployment and other challenging economic conditions although new vehicle sales have increased over previous years we believe our consumers’ cash flows continue to be challenged due to these factors given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macro environment 

another macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry is gas prices during fiscal 2014 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was 348 per gallon compared to 365 per gallon during fiscal 2013 with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month we continue to believe gas prices have an impact on our customers’ abilities to maintain their vehicles allowing us to communicate through our marketing messages the steps needed to improve their gas mileage given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

during fiscal 2014 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years 

 

our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product quantities and assortment specifically during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment as a result we are performing certain strategic tests including adding additional inventory into our hub stores increasing product availability and delivering to stores more frequently 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2014 latest publicly available information miles driven increased slightly compared to the same period last year 

seven year old or older vehicles 

between 2008 and 2012 new vehicle sales were significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2014 the average age of vehicles on the road is 114 years as compared to 113 years as of january 1 2013 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell 

results of operations 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 we reported net sales of 9475 billion compared with 9148 billion for the year ended august 31 2013 a 36 increase from fiscal 2013 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 28 and net sales of 1659 million comprised of sales from new stores and increased commercial programs excluding the 53 rd week last year sales increased 56 

at august 30 2014 we operated 4984 domestic stores 402 stores in mexico and five stores in brazil compared with 4836 domestic stores 362 stores in mexico and three in brazil at august 31 2013 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico and brazil sales increase of 31 for fiscal 2014 excluding the 53 rd week last year total auto parts sales increased 51 

gross profit for fiscal 2014 was 4935 billion or 521 of net sales compared with 4741 billion or 518 of net sales for fiscal 2013 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs and lower shrink expense partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives 17 basis points 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 increased to 3105 billion or 328 of net sales from 2968 billion or 324 of net sales for fiscal 2013 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher store payroll 11 basis points and planned information system investments 10 basis points 

 

interest expense net for fiscal 2014 was 1675 million compared with 1854 million during fiscal 2013 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period average borrowings for fiscal 2014 were 4274 billion compared with 3927 billion for fiscal 2013 and weighted average borrowing rates were 36 for fiscal 2014 compared to 45 for fiscal 2013 

our effective income tax rate was 357 of pretax income for fiscal 2014 compared to 360 for fiscal 2013 

net income for fiscal 2014 increased by 52 to 1070 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 136 to 3157 from 2779 in fiscal 2013 the impact of the fiscal 2014 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 was an increase of approximately 104 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 we reported net sales of 9148 billion compared with 8604 billion for the year ended august 25 2012 a 63 increase from fiscal 2012 this growth was driven primarily by sales from new stores of 2223 million the 53 rd week sales of 1777 million and sales from autoanything for a portion of the fiscal year 

at august 31 2013 we operated 4836 domestic stores 362 stores in mexico and three stores in brazil compared with 4685 domestic stores 321 stores in mexico and none in brazil at august 25 2012 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico and brazil operations sales increase of 52 for fiscal 2013 

gross profit for fiscal 2013 was 4741 billion or 518 of net sales compared with 4432 billion or 515 of net sales for fiscal 2012 the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product acquisition costs partially offset by the inclusion of autoanything 28 basis points 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 increased to 2968 billion or 324 of net sales from 2803 billion or 326 of net sales for fiscal 2012 operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved due to lower incentive compensation 19 basis points partially offset by lower sales growth rates 

interest expense net for fiscal 2013 was 1854 million compared with 1759 million during fiscal 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2013 were 3927 billion compared with 3507 billion for fiscal 2012 and weighted average borrowing rates were 45 for fiscal 2013 compared to 47 for fiscal 2012 

our effective income tax rate was 360 of pretax income for fiscal 2013 compared to 360 for fiscal 2012 

net income for fiscal 2013 increased by 93 to 1016 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 183 to 2779 from 2348 in fiscal 2012 the impact of the fiscal 2013 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was an increase of approximately 109 

in december 2012 we acquired certain assets and liabilities of autoanything an online retailer of specialized automotive products for 116 million with the acquisition we expect to bolster our online presence in the automotive accessory and performance markets the results of operations from autoanything have been included in our other business activities since the date of acquisition 

we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset related to the acquisition of autoanything based on an analysis of autoanything’s revised planned financial results compared to the initial projections we determined it was more likely than not the goodwill attributed to autoanything was impaired accordingly we performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill because the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 183 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 based on our evaluation of the future discounted cash flows of autoanything’s trade name as compared to its carrying value it was determined that autoanything’s trade name was also impaired we recorded an impairment charge of 41 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to the trade name 

 

based on the revised plan financial results we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration at august 31 2013 to 02 million resulting in a decrease to the contingent consideration liability of 233 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the net impact of the impairment charges and the contingent consideration adjustment is a gain of 09 million for fiscal 2013 the net impact is included in operating selling general and administrative expenses in our other business activities 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil 

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2014 17 weeks in 2013 and 16 weeks in 2012 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 represented 322 of annual sales and 349 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 represented 338 of annual sales and 365 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 represented 321 of annual sales and 348 of net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and products net cash provided by operating activities was 1341 billion in fiscal 2014 1415 billion in fiscal 2013 and 1224 billion in fiscal 2012 cash flows from operations are unfavorable to last year due to the change in inventories net of payables partially offset by the growth in net income we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1149 at august 30 2014 1156 at august 31 2013 and 1114 at august 25 2012 our inventory increases are primarily attributable to our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores and an increased number of stores during fiscal 2013 and 2014 we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per store many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newstore development program from the beginning of fiscal 2012 to august 30 2014 we have opened 580 new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 4480 million in fiscal 2014 compared to 5273 million in fiscal 2013 and 3748 million in fiscal 2012 we invested 4381 million in capital assets in fiscal 2014 compared to 4145 million in fiscal 2013 and 3781 million in fiscal 2012 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores new store openings were 190 for fiscal 2014 197 for fiscal 2013 and 193 for fiscal 2012 cash flows used for purchasing intangibles were 111 million for fiscal 2014 cash flows used in the acquisition of autoanything were 1161 million during fiscal 2013 there were no purchases of intangibles or acquisitions in fiscal 2012 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 497 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2014 445 million in fiscal 2013 and 457 million in fiscal 2012 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 468 million in fiscal 2014 379 million in fiscal 2013 and 424 million in fiscal 2012 capital asset disposals provided proceeds of 42 million in fiscal 2014 98 million in fiscal 2013 and 66 million in fiscal 2012 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 9116 million in fiscal 2014 8470 million in fiscal 2013 and 8434 million in fiscal 2012 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1099 billion for fiscal 2014 1387 billion for fiscal 2013 and 1363 billion for fiscal 2012 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 400 million for fiscal 2014 800 million for fiscal 2013 and 500 million for fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2014 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases proceeds from the issuance of debt in fiscal 2013 were also used for the acquisition of autoanything in fiscal 2013 we repaid our 200 million senior notes due in june 2013 and our 300 million senior notes due in october 2012 using commercial paper borrowings there were no repayments of debt in fiscal 2012 in 2014 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 2568 million in 2013 net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings were 1187 million in 2012 net payments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings were 813 million 

subsequent to august 30 2014 we purchased interamerican motor corporation “imc” the second largest distributor of oe quality import replacement parts in the united states for approximately 80 million imc specializes in parts coverage for european and asian cars and it currently operates 17 branches the transaction closed on september 27 2014 and was financed with commercial paper borrowings 

during fiscal 2015 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2014 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our newstore development program enhancements to existing stores and supply chain infrastructure and the acquisition of imc the amount of our investments in our newstore program is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 6 10 and 18 respectively as compared to the prior year our mix of store openings has moved away from buildtosuit leases lower initial capital investment to ground leases and land purchases higher initial capital investment resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august 29 2015 

in addition to the building and land costs our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents of 193 million and 382 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations 

for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 319 as compared to 327 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit 

 

excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases the decrease in roic is primarily due to the increase in average debt we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance 

debt facilities 

in december 2013 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility increasing the capacity under the revolving credit facility to 125 billion this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to 15 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 175 million in capital leases each fiscal year under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in september 2017 

the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 30 2014 was 4951 

as of august 30 2014 8938 million of commercial paper borrowings and 3191 million of the 5750 senior notes due january 2015 are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility as of august 30 2014 we had 1213 billion of availability under our 125 billion revolving credit facility expiring in september 2017 that would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing 

in addition to the revolving credit facility we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million as of august 30 2014 we have 1000 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2016 

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 314 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 30 2014 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis 

on january 14 2014 we issued 400 million in 1300 notes due january 2017 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17 2012 the “shelf registration” the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance on january 14 2014 were used to repay a portion of the 500 million in 6500 senior notes due january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 6500 senior notes 

on april 29 2013 the company issued 500 million in 3125 senior notes due july 2023 under its shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on april 29 2013 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 200 million in 4375 senior notes due june 2013 and for general corporate purposes 

on november 13 2012 we issued 300 million in 2875 senior notes due january 2023 under the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on november 13 2012 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 300 million in 5875 senior notes due in october 2012 and for general corporate purposes 

 

the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the “notes” are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded further all senior notes issued since august 2008 contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 30 2014 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 251 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on june 17 2014 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 1415 billion to 149 billion from january 1998 to august 30 2014 we have repurchased a total of 1369 million shares at an aggregate cost of 14031 billion we repurchased 22 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1099 billion during fiscal 2014 35 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1387 billion during fiscal 2013 and 38 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1363 billion during fiscal 2012 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 30 2014 we have 8692 million remaining under the board of director’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

subsequent to august 30 2014 we have repurchased 374601 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1909 million 

 

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 30 2014 

 

  

     we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account during fiscal 2014 we made contributions of 169 million to the pension plan we expect to make contributions of approximately 26 million during fiscal 2015 however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets 

as of august 30 2014 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 3010 million and our pension assets are valued at 2434 million resulting in a net pension obligation of 576 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 1048 million at august 30 2014 the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 

additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 335 million at august 30 2014 approximately 514 thousand is classified as current liabilities and 330 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 30 2014 

 

 a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

 recent accounting pronouncements 

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out “fifo” method for mexico and brazil inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 3072 million at august 30 2014 calculated using the dollar value method 

 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 2 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 30 2014 would have affected net income by approximately 63 million in fiscal 2014 

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 85 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 150 thousand in each of the last three years 

goodwill and intangibles 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting unit’s fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset 

 

exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates 

the carrying value of goodwill at august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 was 3678 million during fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an 183 million goodwill impairment charge in our other business activities related to the goodwill of autoanything and a 41 million impairment charge to autoanything’s trade name the 41 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of 246 million at august 31 2013 we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of 233 million to the contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at august 31 2013 no impairment charges were recognized in our other business activities in previous fiscal years no impairment charges were recognized in the auto parts stores reporting segment during fiscal 2014 or in previous fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to evaluate goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles 

selfinsurance reserves 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 1951 million at august 30 2014 and 1902 million at august 31 2013 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 126 million for fiscal 2014 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 20 million for fiscal 2014 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing 

 

interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 30 2014 we had approximately 335 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 we have assumed a 75 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets in august 2014 our investment committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the pension plan based on the revised asset allocation target the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changed from 75 for the year ended august 30 2014 to 70 for the year ending august 29 2015 at august 30 2014 our plan assets totaled 2434 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 12 million for the qualified plan 

discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2014 we assumed a discount rate of 43 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 30 2014 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 20 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks each with a notional amount of 100 million these agreements were cash flow hedges used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 300 million senior note debt issuance in november 2012 the fixed rates of the hedges were 207 and 192 and were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on november 1 2012 and resulted in a loss of 51 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 500 million senior note debt issuance in april 2012 the treasury rate locks had notional amounts of 300 million and 100 million with associated fixed rates of 209 and 207 respectively the locks were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on april 20 2012 and resulted in a loss of 28 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 4480 billion as of august 30 2014 and 4259 billion as of august 31 2013 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 1366 million and 722 million at august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 respectively we had 8938 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 30 2014 and 6370 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 31 2013 in fiscal 2014 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 89 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 3450 billion at august 30 2014 and 3550 billion at august 31 2013 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1561 million at august 30 2014 

 

fuel price risk 

from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 

we are exposed to euros canadian dollars and brazilian reals but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 4392 million at august 30 2014 and 3787 million at august 31 2013 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso increased by approximately 19 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2014 and decreased by approximately 11 during fiscal 2013 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 would be approximately 399 million and approximately 344 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

at august 31 2013 our stores were in the following locations 

 

  

marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as warranties that are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts that we sell the wide area network in our stores helps us expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes locate parts at neighboring autozone stores including our hub stores and in some cases place special orders directly with our vendors we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business additionally we offer smartphone apps that provide customers with store locations driving directions operating hours and product availability 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators 

 

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

 we believe that the satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes the econocraft valucraft autozone surebilt proelite duralast duralast gold and duralast platinum brands we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors 

brand marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty card programs primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and 

 

public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives commercial specialists and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores 

 

store development 

the following table reflects our store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

 we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and monterrey mexico in fiscal 2013 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 10 percent of our total sales no vendor supplied more than 10 percent of our purchases and we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store generally has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty store layouts location and convenience and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks 

 

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “duralast platinum” “valucraft” “econocraft” “alldata” “autoanything” “loanatool” and “znet” we believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing and merchandising strategies 

employees 

as of august 31 2013 we employed over 71000 persons approximately 59 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 92 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 5 percent in distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support and other functions included in the above numbers are approximately 5000 persons employed in our mexico and brazil operations

 all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and is based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more 

 

frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4240 stores at august 30 2008 to 5201 stores at august 31 2013 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 6523 billion in fiscal 2008 to 9148 billion in fiscal 2013 an average increase per year of 8 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and increases in samestore sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by continued job losses wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by continued recessionary pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in samestore sales 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

significant changes in macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in calendar years 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009 there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

macroeconomic conditions also impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has stagnated and unemployment has remained at historically high levels during the past five years if the united states government is unable to reach agreement on legislation addressing the united states’ current debt level and budget deficit many economists have predicted another economic recession continued recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses and business failures which could result in our loss of certain small business customers and curtailment of spending by our retail customers in addition continued distress in global credit markets business failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of 

 

our suppliers to obtain necessary short and longterm financing to meet our inventory demands moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs all of these macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 71000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata and autoanything we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers moreover if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize hub stores our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains we could experience inappropriate inventory levels in our stores which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation 

 

our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and autozoners failure to protect the security of our customers’ employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and our reputation could suffer while we take significant steps to protect customer employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards our security measures may be breached in the future due to cyber attack employee error or other acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data to date we have not experienced any significant breaches of information 

damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our stores being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in 2004 we acquired a store site in mount ephraim new jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property we are also investigating and will be addressing potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the new jersey department of environmental protection asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 “directive” that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory and we have contested any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are also named in the directive in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we are eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work and the state is considering the request although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 31 2013 operated 4836 stores in the united states including puerto rico 362 in mexico and three in brazil each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 31 2013 in 3421 of our domestic stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in select stores in mexico as well as in our stores in brazil we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories and performance parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2013 delivering record net income of 1016 billion a 93 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 5437 million a 63 increase over the prior year we completed the year with growth in all areas of our business we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and continue to refine our parts assortment over the past several years various factors have occurred within the economy that affect both our customers and our industry including the impact of the recession continued high unemployment and other challenging economic conditions although we have seen a recent increase in new vehicle sales we believe our consumers’ cash flows continue to decrease due to the previously listed factors given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

we believe other macroeconomic factors have adversely affected both our customers and our industry during fiscal 2013 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states remained at a high level 365 per gallon compared to 357 per gallon during fiscal 2012 we continue to believe gas prices will remain at overall high levels thereby reducing discretionary spending for all consumers and in particular our customers with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

an additional macroeconomic factor facing our customer is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic levels the reduction in our customers’ take home pay as a result of the recent increase in payroll taxes was effective at the beginning of the 2013 calendar year and at this point we cannot predict the impact this change has had or will have on our sales in future periods 

during fiscal 2013 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers while 

 

we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years we did experience a slight decline in sales of the maintenance category as a percentage of sales we believe the slowdown in maintenance related products during fiscal 2013 was largely due to weather related impacts in various regions because of the unusually mild winter during fiscal 2012 across parts of the us we saw a reduced benefit from sales of maintenance related products in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior fiscal year however sales in the maintenance category did improve in the last quarter of fiscal 2013 due to a more normalized winter in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 

our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment specifically during fiscal 2013 we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment as a result we are performing certain strategic tests including adding additional inventory into our hub stores and increasing product availability in our stores we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2013 latest publicly available information miles driven decreased slightly compared to the same period last year 

seven year old or older vehicles 

since 2008 new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to the latest data provided by the automotive aftermarket industry association as of january 1 2013 the average age of vehicles on the road is 113 years as compared to 111 years as of january 1 2012 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell 

results of operations 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 we reported net sales of 9148 billion compared with 8604 billion for the year ended august 25 2012 a 63 increase from fiscal 2012 this growth was driven primarily by sales from new stores of 2223 million the 53 rd week sales of 1777 million and sales from autoanything for a portion of the fiscal year 

at august 31 2013 we operated 4836 domestic stores 362 stores in mexico and three stores in brazil compared with 4685 domestic stores 321 stores in mexico and none in brazil at august 25 2012 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico and brazil sales increase of 52 for fiscal 2013 

gross profit for fiscal 2013 was 4741 billion or 518 of net sales compared with 4432 billion or 515 of net sales for fiscal 2012 the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product acquisition costs partially offset by the inclusion of autoanything 28 basis points 

 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 increased to 2968 billion or 324 of net sales from 2803 billion or 326 of net sales for fiscal 2012 operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved due to lower incentive compensation 19 basis points partially offset by lower sales growth rates 

interest expense net for fiscal 2013 was 1854 million compared with 1759 million during fiscal 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2013 were 3927 billion compared with 3507 billion for fiscal 2012 and weighted average borrowing rates were 45 for fiscal 2013 compared to 47 for fiscal 2012 

our effective income tax rate was 360 of pretax income for fiscal 2013 compared to 360 for fiscal 2012 

net income for fiscal 2013 increased by 93 to 1016 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 183 to 2779 from 2348 in fiscal 2012 the impact of the fiscal 2013 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was an increase of approximately 109 

effective december 2012 we acquired certain assets and liabilities of autoanything an online retailer of specialized automotive products for up to 150 million including an initial cash payment of 115 million up to a 5 million holdback payment for working capital trueups and contingent payments not to exceed 30 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we paid the holdback payment for working capital trueups of 11 million with this acquisition we expect to bolster our online presence in the automotive accessory and performance markets the results of operations from autoanything have been included in our other business activities since the date of acquisition the purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of 834 million and intangible assets totaling 587 million goodwill generated from the acquisition is tax deductible and is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce the contingent consideration is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics through calendar year 2014 with any earned payments due during the first calendar quarter of 2014 and 2015 the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was 227 million 

we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset related to the acquisition of autoanything based on an analysis of autoanything’s revised planned financial results compared to the initial projections we determined it was more likely than not the goodwill attributed to autoanything was impaired accordingly we performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill because the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 183 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 based on our evaluation of the future discounted cash flows of autoanything’s trade name as compared to its carrying value it was determined that autoanything’s trade name was also impaired we recorded an impairment charge of 41 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to the trade name 

based on the revised plan financial results we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration at august 31 2013 to 02 million resulting in a decrease to the contingent consideration liability of 233 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the net impact of the impairment charges and the contingent consideration adjustment is a gain of 09 million the net impact is included in operating selling general and administrative expenses in our other business activities 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for the fiscal year ended august 25 2012 we reported net sales of 8604 billion compared with 8073 billion for the year ended august 27 2011 a 66 increase from fiscal 2011 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 39 and sales from new stores of 2142 million the improvement in domestic same store sales was driven by higher transaction value partially offset by decreased transaction counts 

at august 25 2012 we operated 4685 domestic stores and 321 stores in mexico compared with 4534 domestic stores and 279 stores in mexico at august 27 2011 we reported a total auto parts domestic and mexico operations sales increase of 65 for fiscal 2012 

 

gross profit for fiscal 2012 was 4432 billion or 515 of net sales compared with 4119 billion or 510 of net sales for fiscal 2011 the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher merchandise margins 19 basis points and lower shrink expense 17 basis points lower acquisition costs drove the higher merchandise margins for the year 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 increased to 2803 billion or 326 of net sales from 2625 billion or 325 of net sales for fiscal 2011 the slight increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was the result of higher selfinsurance costs 42 basis points partially offset by lower incentive compensation 30 basis points 

interest expense net for fiscal 2012 was 1759 million compared with 1706 million during fiscal 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2012 were 3507 billion compared with 3103 billion for fiscal 2011 and weighted average borrowing rates were 47 for fiscal 2012 compared to 51 for fiscal 2011 

our effective income tax rate was 360 of pretax income for fiscal 2012 compared to 359 for fiscal 2011 

net income for fiscal 2012 increased by 96 to 9304 million and diluted earnings per share increased 206 to 2348 from 1947 in fiscal 2011 the impact of the fiscal 2012 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 was an increase of approximately 096 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil 

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks in 2013 and 16 weeks in 2012 and 2011 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 represented 338 of annual sales and 365 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 represented 321 of annual sales and 348 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 represented 327 of annual sales and 355 of net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and products net cash provided by operating activities was 1415 billion in fiscal 2013 1224 billion in fiscal 2012 and 1292 billion in fiscal 2011 cash flows from operations are favorable to last year due to the change in inventories net of payables and the growth in net income we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1156 at august 31 2013 1114 at august 25 2012 and 1117 at august 27 2011 our inventory increases are primarily attributable to our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores and an increased number of stores during fiscal 2013 we initiated a variety of strategic inventory tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per store many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newstore development program from the beginning of fiscal 2011 to august 31 2013 we have opened 578 new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 5273 million in fiscal 2013 compared to 3748 million in fiscal 2012 and 3190 million in 

 

fiscal 2011 we invested 4145 million in capital assets in fiscal 2013 compared to 3781 million in fiscal 2012 and 3216 million in fiscal 2011 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores new store openings were 197 for fiscal 2013 193 for fiscal 2012 and 188 for fiscal 2011 cash flows used in the acquisition of autoanything were 1161 million during fiscal 2013 there were no acquisitions in fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 445 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2013 457 million in fiscal 2012 and 438 million in fiscal 2011 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 379 million in fiscal 2013 424 million in fiscal 2012 and 431 million in fiscal 2011 capital asset disposals provided proceeds of 98 million in fiscal 2013 66 million in fiscal 2012 and 33 million in fiscal 2011 

net cash used in financing activities was 8470 million in fiscal 2013 8434 million in fiscal 2012 and 9738 million in fiscal 2011 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1387 billion for fiscal 2013 1363 billion for fiscal 2012 and 1467 billion for fiscal 2011 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 800 million for fiscal 2013 500 million for fiscal 2012 and 500 million for fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases proceeds from the issuance of debt in fiscal 2013 were also used for the acquisition of autoanything in fiscal 2013 we repaid our 200 million senior notes due in june 2013 and our 300 million senior notes due in october 2012 using commercial paper borrowings there were no repayments of debt in fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2011 we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay our 1993 million senior notes due in november 2010 to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes in 2013 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 1187 million in 2012 net payments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings were 813 million in 2011 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowing in the amount of 1415 million 

during fiscal 2014 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2013 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our newstore development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure the amount of our investments in our newstore program is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 10 18 and 2 respectively as compared to the prior year our mix of store openings has moved away from buildtosuit leases lower initial capital investment to ground leases and land purchases higher initial capital investment resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august 30 2014 

in addition to the building and land costs our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world of the 1422 million and 1031 million of cash and cash equivalents at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 respectively 382 million and 78 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations 

 

for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 327 as compared to 330 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases the decrease in roic is primarily due to the acquisition of autoanything we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance 

debt facilities 

in september 2011 we amended and restated our 800 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in july 2012 the capacity under the revolving credit facility was increased to 10 billion this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to 1250 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 175 million in capital leases each fiscal year under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in september 2016 

the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 31 2013 was 4681 

as of august 31 2013 637 million of commercial paper borrowings and 3263 million of the 6500 senior notes due january 2014 are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility as of august 31 2013 we had 9633 million of availability under our 10 billion revolving credit facility expiring in september 2016 that would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing 

in addition to the revolving credit facility we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million as of august 31 2013 we have 994 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2016 

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 418 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2013 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis 

on april 29 2013 we issued 500 million in 3125 senior notes due july 2023 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17 2012 the “shelf registration” the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance on april 29 2013 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the 200 million in 4375 senior notes due june 2013 

on november 13 2012 we issued 300 million in 2875 senior notes due january 2023 under the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on november 13 2012 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 300 million in 5875 senior notes due in october 2012 and for general corporate purposes 

 

on april 24 2012 we issued 500 million in 3700 senior notes due april 2022 under the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on april 24 2012 were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes on november 15 2010 we issued 500 million in 4000 senior notes due 2020 under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july 29 2008 we used the proceeds from the november 15 2010 issuance of debt to repay the principal due relating to the 4750 senior notes that matured on november 15 2010 to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 

the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 6500 and 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the “notes” are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded the notes along with the 3125 senior notes issued in april 2013 the 2875 senior notes issued in november 2012 the 3700 senior notes issued in april 2012 and the 4000 senior notes issued in during november 2010 also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 31 2013 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 251 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on june 11 2013 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 1265 billion to 1340 billion from january 1998 to august 31 2013 we have repurchased a total of 1346 million shares at an aggregate cost of 1293 billion we repurchased 35 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 139 billion during fiscal 2013 38 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 136 billion during fiscal 2012 and 56 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 147 billion during fiscal 2011 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 31 2013 we have 4684 million remaining under the board of director’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

subsequent to august 31 2013 we have repurchased 355150 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1498 million 

 

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2013 

 

  

     we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account during fiscal 2013 we made contributions of 169 million to the pension plan we expect to make contributions of approximately 4 million during fiscal 2014 however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets 

as of august 31 2013 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 2568 million and our pension assets are valued at 2081 million resulting in a net pension obligation of 487 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 836 million at august 31 2013 the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 

additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 354 million at august 31 2013 approximately 22 million is classified as current liabilities and 332 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 31 2013 

 

 a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets the standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

 recent accounting pronouncements 

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out “fifo” method for mexico inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 2837 million at august 31 2013 calculated using the dollar value method 

 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 20 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 31 2013 would have affected net income by approximately 6 million in fiscal 2013 

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 500 thousand in each of the last three years 

goodwill and intangibles 

we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceeds the current fair value we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting unit’s fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss 

indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset 

 

exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates 

the carrying value of goodwill at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 was 3678 million and 3026 million respectively during fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an 183 million goodwill impairment charge in our other business activities related to the goodwill of autoanything and a 41 million impairment charge to autoanything’s trade name the 41 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of 246 million at august 31 2013 no indefinitelived intangible amounts were recorded at august 25 2012 we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of 233 million to the contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at august 31 2013 no impairment charges were recognized in our other business activities in previous fiscal years no impairment charges were recognized in the auto parts stores reporting segment during fiscal 2013 or in previous fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to evaluate goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles 

selfinsurance reserves 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 1902 million at august 31 2013 and 1758 million at august 25 2012 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 12 million for fiscal 2013 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 2 million for fiscal 2013 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the 

 

contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 31 2013 we had approximately 354 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 we have assumed a 75 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets at august 31 2013 our plan assets totaled 208 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 1 million for the qualified plan 

discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2013 we assumed a discount rate of 52 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 31 2013 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 2 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks each with a notional amount of 100 million these agreements were cash flow hedges used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 300 million senior note debt issuance in november 2012 the fixed rates of the hedges were 207 and 192 and were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on november 1 2012 and resulted in a loss of 51 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 500 million senior note debt issuance in april 2012 the treasury rate locks had notional amounts of 300 million and 100 million with associated fixed rates of 209 and 207 respectively the locks were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on april 20 2012 and resulted in a loss of 28 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 4259 billion as of august 31 2013 and 4055 billion as of august 25 2012 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 722 million and 2866 million at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 respectively we had 6370 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 31 2013 and 5182 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 25 2012 in fiscal 2013 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 6 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 3550 billion at august 31 2013 and 3250 billion at august 25 2012 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1284 million at august 31 2013 

fuel price risk 

from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel 

 

exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 

we are exposed to euros canadian dollars and brazilian reals but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars

we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 3787 million at august 31 2013 and 3157 million at august 25 2012 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 11 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2013 and decreased by approximately 62 during fiscal 2012 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 amounted to approximately 34 million and approximately 29 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations

introduction 

autozone inc “autozone” the “company” “we” “our” or “us” is the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 25 2012 operated 4685 stores in the united states including puerto rico and 321 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 25 2012 in 3053 of our domestic stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we have commercial programs in select stores in mexico as well we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

at august 25 2012 our stores were in the following locations 

 

   

 marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as warranties that are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts that we sell the wide area network in our stores helps us expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes locate parts at neighboring autozone stores including our hub stores and in some cases place special orders directly with our vendors additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive parts through wwwautozonecom and offer smartphone apps that provide customers with store locations driving directions operating hours and product availability 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators 

  

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

 we believe that the satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes the econocraft valucraft autozone duralast duralast gold and duralast platinum brands we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors 

brand marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty card programs primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage in store circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico and mexico as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as direct commercial sales through wwwautozoneprocom through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

  

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives and commercial specialists receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and chihuahua mexico we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores 

  

store development 

the following table reflects our store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

 we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and monterrey mexico in fiscal 2012 one class of similar products accounted for 10 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied more than 10 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store generally has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty store layouts location and convenience and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks 

  

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “duralast platinum” “valucraft” “econocraft” “alldata” “loanatool” and “znet” we believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing and merchandising strategies 

employees 

as of august 25 2012 we employed over 70000 persons approximately 59 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 92 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 5 percent in distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support and other functions included in the above numbers are approximately 4100 persons employed in our mexico operations 

we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our autozoners are good

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected 

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

 for the long term demand for our products may be affected by 

 

  

  

 all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and is based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

  

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4056 stores at august 25 2007 to 5006 stores at august 25 2012 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 6170 billion in fiscal 2007 to 8604 billion in fiscal 2012 an average increase per year of 8 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and increases in samestore sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by continued job losses wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by continued recessionary pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in samestore sales 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

significant changes in macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in calendar years 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009 there was no liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

  

macroeconomic conditions also impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has stagnated and unemployment has remained at historically high levels during the past four years if the united states government is unable to reach agreement on legislation addressing the united states’ current debt level and budget deficit many economists have predicted another economic recession continued recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses and business failures which could result in our loss of certain small business customers and curtailment of spending by our retail customers in addition continued distress in global credit markets business failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to obtain necessary short and longterm financing to meet our inventory demands moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs all of these macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 70000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and alldata we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers moreover if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize hub stores our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains we could experience inappropriate inventory levels in our stores which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

  

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation failure to protect the security of our customers’ employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and our reputation could suffer damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our stores being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations 

healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “patient act” as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by congress and state legislatures may have an impact on our business based on the current form of the patient act the impact could be extensive and could increase our employee healthcarerelated costs while the significant costs of the recent healthcare legislation enacted will occur after 2013 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time changes to our healthcare costs structure could have a significant negative impact on our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 25 2012 operated 4685 stores in the united states including puerto rico and 321 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 25 2012 in 3053 of our domestic stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we have commercial programs in select stores in mexico as well we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2012 delivering record net income of 9304 million a 96 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 5309 million a 66 increase over the prior year we completed the year with growth in all areas of our business we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and continue to refine our parts assortment there are various factors occurring within the current economy that affect both our customers and our industry including the impact of the recession continued high unemployment and other challenging economic conditions which we believe have aided our sales growth during the year as consumers’ cash flows have decreased due to these factors we believe consumers have become more likely to keep their current vehicles longer and perform repair and maintenance in order to keep those vehicles well maintained given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

another macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry is gas prices we believe gas prices have adversely impacted our customers’ behavior with respect to driving and maintaining their cars with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month during fiscal 2012 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states remained at a high level of 357 per gallon compared to 333 per gallon during fiscal 2011 we continue to believe gas prices remain at overall high levels thereby reducing discretionary spending for all consumers and in particular our customers given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

during fiscal 2012 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 83 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years we did experience a slight decline in sales of the maintenance category we believe maintenance related products were negatively impacted by weather because of the unusually mild winter across parts of the us we saw less wear on maintenance related products compared to the prior fiscal year we remain focused on refining and expanding our product assortment to ensure we have the best merchandise at the right price in each of our categories 

  

our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items prior to the recession we had seen a close correlation between annual miles driven and our annual net sales however this correlation has not existed in the recent recessionary period since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2012 latest publicly available information miles driven remained relatively flat compared to the same period last year however during the first two quarters of calendar 2012 miles driven improved by 11 compared to the prior year period throughout this fiscal year and contrary to the correlation experienced prior to the recession sales have grown at a consistent rate while miles driven have grown at a slower rate than what we have historically experienced we believe that the impact of changes in other factors primarily an increase in the average age of vehicles more than offset the impact of miles driven over the longterm we believe that annual miles driven will return to prerecession low single digit growth rates and the correlation between annual miles driven and the annual sales growth of our industry should return 

seven year old or older vehicles 

since 2008 new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to data provided by the automotive aftermarket industry association as of december 2011 the average age of vehicles on the road is 108 years as compared to 106 years as of december 2010 as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products that we sell although we have seen an improvement in new car sales during fiscal 2011 and 2012 in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy 

results of operations 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for the fiscal year ended august 25 2012 we reported net sales of 8604 billion compared with 8073 billion for the year ended august 27 2011 a 66 increase from fiscal 2011 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 39 and sales from new stores of 2142 million the improvement in domestic same store sales was driven by higher transaction value partially offset by decreased transaction counts 

at august 25 2012 we operated 4685 domestic stores and 321 stores in mexico compared with 4534 domestic stores and 279 stores in mexico at august 27 2011 we reported a total auto parts domestic and mexico operations sales increase of 65 for fiscal 2012 

gross profit for fiscal 2012 was 4432 billion or 515 of net sales compared with 4119 billion or 510 of net sales for fiscal 2011 the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher merchandise margins 19 basis points and lower shrink expense 17 basis points lower acquisition costs drove the higher merchandise margins for the year 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 increased to 2803 billion or 326 of net sales from 2625 billion or 325 of net sales for fiscal 2011 the slight increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was the result of higher selfinsurance costs 42 basis points partially offset by lower incentive compensation 30 basis points 

  

interest expense net for fiscal 2012 was 1759 million compared with 1706 million during fiscal 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2012 were 3507 billion compared with 3103 billion for fiscal 2011 and weighted average borrowing rates were 47 for fiscal 2012 compared to 51 for fiscal 2011 

our effective income tax rate was 360 of pretax income for fiscal 2012 compared to 359 for fiscal 2011 

net income for fiscal 2012 increased by 96 to 9304 million and diluted earnings per share increased 206 to 2348 from 1947 in fiscal 2011 the impact of the fiscal 2012 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 was an increase of approximately 096 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2011 we reported net sales of 8073 billion compared with 7363 billion for the year ended august 28 2010 a 96 increase from fiscal 2010 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 63 and sales from new stores of 2168 million the improvement in domestic same store sales was driven by higher transaction value and to a lesser extent higher transaction count trends higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to more complex costly products and commodity price increases 

at august 27 2011 we operated 4534 domestic stores and 279 stores in mexico compared with 4389 domestic stores and 238 stores in mexico at august 28 2010 we reported a total auto parts domestic and mexico operations sales increase of 96 for fiscal 2011 

gross profit for fiscal 2011 was 4119 billion or 510 of net sales compared with 3712 billion or 504 of net sales for fiscal 2010 the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower shrink expense 32 basis points and higher merchandise margins 26 basis points increased penetration of duralast product sales as well as retail price increases on commodity based products drove the higher merchandise margins which were partially offset by increased penetration of commercial sales 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 increased to 2625 billion or 325 of net sales from 2392 billion or 325 of net sales for fiscal 2010 the slight increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was the result of higher fuel costs 20 basis points and increased incentive compensation costs 17 basis points partially offset by leverage due to higher sales volumes 

interest expense net for fiscal 2011 was 1706 million compared with 1589 million during fiscal 2010 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2011 were 3103 billion compared with 2752 billion for fiscal 2010 and weighted average borrowing rates were 51 for fiscal 2011 compared to 53 for fiscal 2010 

our effective income tax rate was 359 of pretax income for fiscal 2011 compared to 364 for fiscal 2010 

net income for fiscal 2011 increased by 150 to 8490 million and diluted earnings per share increased 300 to 1947 from 1497 in fiscal 2010 the impact of the fiscal 2011 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 was an increase of approximately 115 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico and mexico 

  

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2012 2011 and 2010 because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 represented 321 of annual sales and 348 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 represented 327 of annual sales and 355 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 represented 332 of annual sales and 364 of net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and products net cash provided by operating activities was 1224 billion in fiscal 2012 1292 billion in fiscal 2011 and 1196 billion in fiscal 2010 cash flows from operations are unfavorable to last year due to the change in inventories net of payables offset by the growth in net income we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1114 at august 25 2012 1117 at august 27 2011 and 1056 at august 28 2010 our inventory increases are primarily attributable to an increased number of stores and to a lesser extent our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newstore development program from the beginning of fiscal 2010 to august 25 2012 we have opened 594 new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 3748 million in fiscal 2012 compared to 3190 million in fiscal 2011 and 3074 million in fiscal 2010 we invested 3781 million in capital assets in fiscal 2012 compared to 3216 million in fiscal 2011 and 3154 million in fiscal 2010 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened increased investment in our existing stores and continued investment in our hub store initiative new store openings were 193 for fiscal 2012 188 for fiscal 2011 and 213 for fiscal 2010 we also completed 40 hub projects in fiscal 2012 and 20 hub projects in fiscal 2011 as part of our ongoing hub initiative we invest a portion of our assets held by the company’s wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we acquired 457 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2012 438 million in fiscal 2011 and 562 million in fiscal 2010 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 424 million in fiscal 2012 431 million in fiscal 2011 and 526 million in fiscal 2010 capital asset disposals provided 66 million in fiscal 2012 33 million in fiscal 2011 and 115 million in fiscal 2010 

net cash used in financing activities was 8434 million in fiscal 2012 9738 million in fiscal 2011 and 8835 million in fiscal 2010 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1363 billion for fiscal 2012 1467 billion for fiscal 2011 and 1124 billion for fiscal 2010 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 5000 million for fiscal 2012 and 5000 million for fiscal 2011 there were no debt issuances in fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2012 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases in fiscal 2011 we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay our 1993 million term loan in november 2010 to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes there were no repayments of debt for fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2010 net payments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings were 813 million for fiscal 2012 in 2011 and 2010 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short term borrowing in the amount of 1415 million and 1816 million respectively 

during fiscal 2013 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2012 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our newstore development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure the amount of our investments in our newstore program is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 18 2 and 16 respectively as compared to the prior year our mix of store openings has moved away from buildtosuit leases lower initial capital investment to ground leases and land purchases higher initial capital investment resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august 31 2013 

  

in addition to the building and land costs our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

our cash balances are held in various locations around the world of the 103 million and 98 million of cash and cash equivalents at august 25 2012 and august 27 2011 respectively 78 million and 67 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash in our foreign operations 

for the fiscal year ended august 25 2012 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 330 as compared to 313 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases roic increased primarily due to increased aftertax operating profit we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance 

debt facilities 

in september 2011 we amended and restated our 800 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in july 2012 the capacity under the revolving credit facility was increased to 10 billion this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to 1250 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 175 million in capital leases each fiscal year under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in september 2016 

the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 25 2012 was 4581 

as the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit we had 4549 million of available capacity under our 10 billion revolving credit facility at august 25 2012 

in june 2010 we entered into a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit facility as of august 25 2012 we have 987 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2013 

  

on april 24 2012 we issued 500 million in 3700 senior notes due april 2022 under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on april 17 2012 the “shelf registration” the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance on april 24 2012 were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes on november 15 2010 we issued 500 million in 4000 senior notes due 2020 under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july 29 2008 we used the proceeds from the november 15 2010 issuance of debt to repay the principal due relating to the 4750 senior notes that matured on november 15 2010 to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 

the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 6500 and 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the “notes” are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded the notes along with the 3700 senior notes issued in april 2012 and the 4000 senior notes issued in during november 2010 also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 25 2012 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

for the fiscal year ended august 25 2012 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 251 as compared to 241 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” on march 7 2012 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 1115 billion to 1190 billion from january 1998 to august 25 2012 we have repurchased a total of 1311 million shares at an aggregate cost of 115 billion we repurchased 38 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1363 billion during fiscal 2012 56 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1467 billion during fiscal 2011 and 64 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1124 billion during fiscal 2010 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 25 2012 we have 3558 million remaining under the board of director’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

subsequent to august 25 2012 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 1190 billion to 1265 billion we have repurchased 629168 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 2346 million during fiscal 2013 

  

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 25 2012 

 

  

     we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account during fiscal 2012 we made contributions of 154 million to the pension plan we expect to make contributions of approximately 9 million during fiscal 2013 however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets 

as of august 25 2012 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 3052 million and our pension assets are valued at 1814 million resulting in a net pension obligation of 1238 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 1547 million at august 25 2012 the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 

additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 318 million at august 25 2012 approximately 75 million is classified as current liabilities and 243 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 25 2012 

 

 a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet the standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

  

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out “fifo” method for mexico inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 2704 million at august 25 2012 calculated using the dollar value method 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 20 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 25 2012 would have affected net income by approximately 7 million in fiscal 2012 

  

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 500 thousand in each of the last three years 

selfinsurance reserves 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 1758 million at august 25 2012 and 1593 million at august 27 2011 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 11 million for fiscal 2012 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 2 million for fiscal 2012 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 25 2012 we had approximately 318 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

  

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 25 2012 we have assumed a 75 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets at august 25 2012 our plan assets totaled 181 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 900 thousand for the qualified plan 

discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2012 we assumed a discount rate of 39 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 25 2012 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 2 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 the company entered into two treasury rate locks these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 500 million senior note debt issuance in april 2012 the treasury rate locks had notional amounts of 300 million and 100 million with associated fixed rates of 209 and 207 respectively the locks were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on april 20 2012 and resulted in a loss of 28 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings 

as of august 25 2012 we held two treasury rate locks each with a notional amount of 100 million these agreements which are set to expire on november 1 2012 are cash flow hedges used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates relating to an anticipated debt transaction the fixed rates of the hedges are 207 and 192 and are benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes it is expected that upon settlement of these agreements the realized gain or loss will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 4055 billion as of august 25 2012 and 3633 billion as of august 27 2011 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 2866 million and 2810 million at august 25 2012 and august 27 2011 respectively we had 5182 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 25 2012 and 6017 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 27 2011 in fiscal 2012 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 5 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 3250 billion at august 25 2012 and 2750 billion at august 27 2011 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 130 million at august 25 2012 

fuel price risk 

from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 

  

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material we are exposed to euros canadian dollars and brazilian reals but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars 

we generally view our investments in the mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 3157 million at august 25 2012 and 2922 million at august 27 2011 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 25 2012 and august 27 2011 amounted to approximately 29 million and approximately 27 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

during fiscal 2012 exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 62 with respect to the us dollar exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso increased by approximately 43 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2011

marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts and warranties that are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts that we sell the wide area network in our stores helps us expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes locate parts at neighboring autozone stores including our hub stores and in some cases place special orders directly with our vendors 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

we believe that the satisfaction of diy customers and professional technicians is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes the valucraft autozone duralast and duralast gold brands we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors 

brand marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty card programs primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the united states and puerto rico as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to our commercial customers as well as direct commercial sales through wwwautozoneprocom the program operated out of 2659 domestic stores as of august 27 2011 through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on national regional and public sector commercial accounts

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives and commercial specialists receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and chihuahua mexico we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores

store development 

the following table reflects our store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or “our kind of vehicles” these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and monterrey mexico in fiscal 2011 one class of similar products accounted for 10 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied more than 10 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store generally has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty store layouts location and convenience and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks 

  8 

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “valucraft” “alldata” “loanatool” and “znet” we believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing and merchandising strategies 

employees 

as of august 27 2011 we employed over 65000 persons approximately 57 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 91 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 5 percent in distribution centers and approximately 4 percent in store support and other functions included in the above numbers are approximately 3500 persons employed in our mexico operations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected 

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors including 

 

for the long term demand for our products may be affected by 

 

all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and is based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

  11 

we may not be able to sustain our recent rate of sales growth 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 3871 stores at august 26 2006 to 4813 stores at august 27 2011 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 5948 billion in fiscal 2006 to 8073 billion in fiscal 2011 an average increase per year of 7 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and increases in samestore sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by continued job losses wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by continued recessionary pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in samestore sales 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

deterioration in the global credit markets changes in our credit ratings and macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in calendar years 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009 there was no liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

macroeconomic conditions also impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has stagnated and unemployment has remained at historically high levels during the past three years continued recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses and business failures which could result in our loss of certain small business customers and curtailment of spending by our retail customers in addition continued distress in global credit markets business failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to obtain necessary short and longterm financing to meet our inventory demands moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs all of these macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

  12 

our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 65000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and alldata we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers moreover if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

our largest stockholder as a result of its voting ownership may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders 

as of october 17 2011 esl investments inc and certain of its affiliates together “esl” beneficially owned approximately 293 of our outstanding common stock as a result esl may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders including the election of directors and potential change of control transactions in the future esl may acquire or sell shares of common stock and thereby increase or decrease its ownership stake in us significant fluctuations in their level of ownership could have an impact on our share price 

in june 2008 we entered into an agreement with esl the “esl agreement” in which esl has agreed to vote shares of our common stock owned by esl in excess of 375 in the same proportion as all noneslowned shares are voted additionally under the terms of the esl agreement the company added two directors in august 2008 that were identified by esl william c crowley one of the two directors identified by esl is the president and chief operating officer of esl investments inc 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize hub stores our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains we could experience inappropriate inventory levels in our stores which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

  13 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation failure to protect the security of our customers’ personal information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and our reputation could suffer damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our stores being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations 

healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “patient act” as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by congress and state legislatures may have an impact on our business based on the current form of the patient act the impact could be extensive and could increase our employee healthcarerelated costs while the significant costs of the recent healthcare legislation enacted will occur after 2013 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time changes to our healthcare costs structure could have a significant negative impact on our business

 item 2 properties 

the following table reflects the square footage and number of leased and owned properties for our stores as of august 27 2011 

 

we have approximately 40 million square feet in distribution centers servicing our stores of which approximately 13 million square feet is leased and the remainder is owned our distribution centers are located in arizona california georgia illinois ohio pennsylvania tennessee texas and mexico our primary store support center is located in memphis tennessee and consists of approximately 260000 square feet we also have two additional store support centers located in monterrey mexico and chihuahua mexico the alldata headquarters building in elk grove california is leased and we also own or lease other properties that are not material in the aggregate 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we were a defendant in a lawsuit entitled “coalition for a level playing field llc et al v autozone inc et al” filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york in october 2004 the case was originally filed by more than 200 plaintiffs which are principally automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers against a number of defendants including automotive aftermarket retailers and aftermarket automotive parts manufacturers in the amended complaint the plaintiffs alleged inter alia  that some or all of the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants had knowingly received in violation of the robinsonpatman act the “act” from various of the manufacturer defendants benefits such as volume discounts rebates early buy allowances and other allowances fees inventory without payment sham advertising and promotional payments a share in the manufacturers’ profits benefits of payonscan purchases implementation of radio frequency identification technology and excessive payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers additionally a subset of plaintiffs alleged a claim of fraud against the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants based on discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar claims under the act in the prior litigation the discovery dispute as well as the underlying claims was decided in favor of autozone and the other automotive aftermarket retailer defendants who proceeded to trial pursuant to a unanimous jury verdict which was affirmed by the second circuit court of appeals in the current litigation the plaintiffs sought an unspecified amount of damages including statutory trebling attorneys’ fees and a permanent injunction prohibiting the aftermarket retailer defendants from inducing andor knowingly receiving discriminatory prices from any of the aftermarket manufacturer defendants and from opening up any further stores to compete with the plaintiffs as long as the defendants allegedly continue to violate the act 

in an order dated september 7 2010 and issued on september 16 2010 the court granted motions to dismiss all claims against autozone and its codefendant competitors and suppliers based on the record in the prior litigation the court dismissed with prejudice all overlapping claims — that is those covering the same time periods covered by the prior litigation and brought by the judgment plaintiffs in the prior litigation the court also dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs’ attempt to revisit discovery disputes from the prior litigation further with respect to the other claims under the act the court found that the factual statements contained in the complaint fall short of what would be necessary to support a plausible inference of unlawful price discrimination finally the court held that the autozone payonscan program is a difference in nonprice terms that are not governed by the act the court ordered the case closed but also stated that “in an abundance of caution the court was deferring decision on whether to grant leave to amend to allow plaintiff an opportunity to propose curative amendments” the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint and attached a proposed third amended and supplemental complaint the “third amended complaint” on behalf of four plaintiffs the third amended complaint repeated and expanded certain allegations from previous complaints asserting two claims under the act but stated that all other plaintiffs have withdrawn their claims and that inter alia  chief auto parts inc had been dismissed as a defendant autozone and the codefendants filed an opposition to the motion seeking leave to amend 

  15 

in an order dated september 28 2011 the court denied the four remaining plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a third amended complaint because the proposed third amended complaint failed to address deficiencies previously identified by the court 

we believe this suit to be without merit and are vigorously defending against it we are unable to estimate a loss or possible range of loss 

in 2004 autozone acquired a store site in mount ephraim new jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property autozone has conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of visible contamination on the property and is investigating and will be addressing potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we are eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of its remediation costs by the state of new jersey although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

we are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices we do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 27 2011 operated 4534 stores in the united states including puerto rico and 279 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 27 2011 in 2659 of our domestic stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2011 delivering record net income of 8490 million a 150 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 7104 million a 96 increase over the prior year we completed the year with strong growth in our commercial and retail businesses we are pleased with the results of our retail business and encouraged by the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and continue to refine our parts assortment there are various factors occurring within the current economy that affect both our customers and our industry including the impact of the recent recession continued high unemployment and other challenging economic conditions as consumers’ cash flows have decreased due to these factors we believe consumers have become more likely to keep their current vehicles longer and perform repair and maintenance in order to keep those vehicles well maintained our belief is supported by industry data showing an increase in the average age of vehicles on the road and declines in new car sales over recent years as compared to historical levels which we believe have led to an increase in demand for the products that we sell given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future 

more recently we believe changes in gas prices have adversely impacted our customers’ behavior with respect to driving and maintaining their cars with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the united states each 1 dollar decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month in fiscal 2011 unleaded gas prices increased by 095 per gallon finishing the fourth quarter at 363 per gallon on a national level during the comparable prior year period unleaded gas prices increased only 007 per gallon finishing the fourth quarter at 268 per gallon we believe the increase in gas prices is reducing discretionary spending for all consumers and in particular our customers given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease in the future nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

during fiscal 2011 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 83 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years we did experience a slight decline in sales of maintenance and discretionary categories we believe maintenance and discretionary related products were impacted by higher gas prices during the latter half of the year we remain focused on refining and expanding our product assortment to ensure we have the best merchandise at the right price in each of our categories 

  20 

our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items prior to the recession we had seen a close correlation between annual miles driven and our annual net sales however this correlation has not existed in the recessionary period since the beginning of the fiscal year and through july 2011 latest publicly available information miles driven were relatively flat as compared to the comparable prior year period throughout this period and contrary to the correlation experienced prior to the recession sales have grown at an increased rate while miles driven have declined or grown at a slower rate than what we have historically experienced we believe that the impact of changes in other factors primarily an increase in the average age of vehicles more than offset the impact of miles driven over the longterm we believe that annual miles driven will return to prerecession low single digit growth rates and the correlation between annual miles driven and the annual sales growth of our industry should return 

seven year old or older vehicles 

since 2008 new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to data provided by the automotive aftermarket industry association as of december 2010 the average age of vehicles on the road is 106 years as compared to 103 years as of december 2009 as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products that we sell although we have seen a slight improvement in new car sales during fiscal 2011 in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy 

results of operations 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2011 we reported net sales of 8073 billion compared with 7363 billion for the year ended august 28 2010 a 96 increase from fiscal 2010 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 63 and sales from new stores of 2168 million the improvement in domestic same store sales was driven by higher transaction value and to a lesser extent higher transaction count trends higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to more complex costly products and commodity price increases 

at august 27 2011 we operated 4534 domestic stores and 279 stores in mexico compared with 4389 domestic stores and 238 stores in mexico at august 28 2010 we reported a domestic retail sales increase of 68 and a domestic commercial sales increase of 223 for fiscal 2011 

gross profit for fiscal 2011 was 4119 billion or 510 of net sales compared with 3712 billion or 504 of net sales for fiscal 2010 the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower shrink expense 32 basis points and higher merchandise margins 26 basis points increased penetration of duralast product sales as well as retail price increases on commodity based products drove the higher merchandise margins which were partially offset by increased penetration of commercial sales 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 increased to 2625 billion or 325 of net sales from 2392 billion or 325 of net sales for fiscal 2010 the slight increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was the result of higher fuel costs 20 basis points and increased incentive compensation costs 17 basis points partially offset by leverage due to higher sales volumes 

  21 

interest expense net for fiscal 2011 was 1706 million compared with 1589 million during fiscal 2010 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2011 were 3103 billion compared with 2752 billion for fiscal 2010 and weighted average borrowing rates were 51 for fiscal 2011 compared to 53 for fiscal 2010 

our effective income tax rate was 359 of pretax income for fiscal 2011 compared to 364 for fiscal 2010 

net income for fiscal 2011 increased by 150 to 8490 million and diluted earnings per share increased 300 to 1947 from 1497 in fiscal 2010 the impact of the fiscal 2011 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 was an increase of approximately 115 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

for the fiscal year ended august 28 2010 we reported net sales of 7363 billion compared with 6817 billion for the year ended august 29 2009 an 80 increase from fiscal 2009 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 54 and sales from new stores of 2034 million the improvement in same store sales was driven by an improvement in transaction count trends while increases in average transaction value remained generally consistent with our longterm trends higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to both more complex costly products and commodity price increases 

at august 28 2010 we operated 4389 domestic stores and 238 stores in mexico compared with 4229 domestic stores and 188 stores in mexico at august 29 2009 we reported a domestic retail sales increase of 69 and a domestic commercial sales increase of 138 for fiscal 2010 

gross profit for fiscal 2010 was 3712 billion or 504 of net sales compared with 3416 billion or 501 of net sales for fiscal 2009 the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to leveraging distribution costs due to higher sales and operating efficiencies 19 basis points 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 increased to 2392 billion or 325 of net sales from 2240 billion or 329 of net sales for fiscal 2009 the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of sales reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales partially offset by higher pension expense 17 basis points and the continued investment in the hub store initiative 16 basis points 

interest expense net for fiscal 2010 was 1589 million compared with 1423 million during fiscal 2009 this increase was due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period average borrowings for fiscal 2010 were 2752 billion compared with 2460 billion for fiscal 2009 and weighted average borrowing rates were 53 for fiscal 2010 compared to 54 for fiscal 2009 

our effective income tax rate was 364 of pretax income for fiscal 2010 compared to 364 for fiscal 2009 

net income for fiscal 2010 increased by 124 to 7383 million and diluted earnings per share increased 276 to 1497 from 1173 in fiscal 2009 the impact of the fiscal 2010 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 was an increase of approximately 074 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico and mexico

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2011 2010 and 2009 because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 represented 327 of annual sales and 355 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 represented 332 of annual sales and 364 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 represented 327 of annual sales and 359 of net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 1292 billion in fiscal 2011 1196 billion in fiscal 2010 and 9238 million in fiscal 2009 the increase over prior year was primarily due to higher net income of 1107 million and timing of income tax deductions offset by inventory purchases during fiscal 2011 cash flows from operating activities continue to benefit from our inventory purchases being financed by our vendors the increase in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the growth in net income and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors financed a large portion of our inventory we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 112 at august 27 2011 106 at august 28 2010 and 96 at august 29 2009 our inventory increases are primarily attributable to an increased number of stores and to a lesser extent our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue to grow accounts payable at a faster rate than inventory 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newstore development program from the beginning of fiscal 2009 to august 27 2011 we have opened 581 new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 3190 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 3074 million in fiscal 2010 and 2637 million in fiscal 2009 we invested 3216 million in capital assets in fiscal 2011 compared to 3154 million in capital assets in fiscal 2010 and 2722 million in capital assets in fiscal 2009 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores new store openings were 188 for fiscal 2011 213 for fiscal 2010 and 180 for fiscal 2009 we invest a portion of our assets held by the company’s wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we acquired 438 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2011 562 million in fiscal 2010 and 484 million in fiscal 2009 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 431 million in fiscal 2011 526 million in fiscal 2010 and 463 million in fiscal 2009 capital asset disposals provided 33 million in fiscal 2011 115 million in fiscal 2010 and 107 million in fiscal 2009 

net cash used in financing activities was 9738 million in fiscal 2011 8835 million in fiscal 2010 and 8069 million in fiscal 2009 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1467 billion for fiscal 2011 1124 billion for fiscal 2010 and 1300 billion for fiscal 2009 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations and at times by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 5000 million for fiscal 2011 there were no debt issuances in fiscal 2010 and 5000 million for fiscal 2009 repayments of debt for fiscal 2011 were 1993 million there were no debt repayments for fiscal 2010 and 3007 million for fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2011 we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay our 1993 million term loan in november 2010 to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases proceeds from the debt issuance in fiscal 2009 were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness to prepay our 3000 million term loan in august 2009 and for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings were 1415 million for fiscal 2011 1816 million for fiscal 2010 and 2776 million for fiscal 2009 

during fiscal 2012 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2011 and more consistent with growth rates experienced in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 our investment is expected to be directed primarily to our newstore development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure the amount of our investments in our newstore program is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states or mexico or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and 

  23 

fiscal 2009 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 2 16 and 12 respectively as compared to the prior year our mix of store openings has moved away from buildtosuit leases lower initial capital investment to ground leases and land purchases higher initial capital investment resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august 25 2012 

in addition to the building and land costs our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2011 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 313 as compared to 276 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases roic increased primarily due to increased aftertax operating profit we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance 

debt facilities 

in september 2011 we amended and restated our 800 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in july 2012 the capacity under the revolving credit facility was increased to 10 billion this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to 1250 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 175 million in capital leases each fiscal year under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in september 2016 

the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 27 2011 was 4441 

as the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit we had 2007 million in available capacity under our previous revolving credit facility at august 27 2011 assuming the amended and restated revolving credit facility had been executed as of our balance sheet date we would have had 4007 million in available capacity under the facility at august 27 2011 

in june 2010 we entered into a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit facility as of august 27 2011 we have 929 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2013 

  24 

on november 15 2010 we issued 500 million in 4000 senior notes due 2020 under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july 29 2008 the “shelf registration” the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions during november 2010 we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay the principal due relating to the 1993 million in 4750 senior notes that matured on november 15 2010 to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 

the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 6500 and 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the “notes” are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded the notes along with the 4000 senior notes issued in during november 2010 also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 27 2011 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

for the fiscal year ended august 27 2011 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 241 as compared to 241 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the “board” the program was amended in june 2011 to increase the repurchase authorization to 104 billion from 99 billion from january 1998 to august 27 2011 we have repurchased a total of 1273 million shares at an aggregate cost of 102 billion we repurchased 56 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1467 billion during fiscal 2011 64 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1124 billion during fiscal 2010 and 93 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1300 billion during fiscal 2009 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 27 2011 we have 2186 million remaining under the board of director’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

subsequent to the end of fiscal 2011 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 104 billion to 1115 billion we have repurchased approximately 527 thousand shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 1697 million during fiscal 2012

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 27 2011 

 

 we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account during fiscal 2011 we made contributions of 341 million to the pension plan we expect to make contributions of approximately 7 million during fiscal 2012 however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets 

as of august 27 2011 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 2416 million and our pension assets are valued at 1569 million resulting in a net pension obligation of 848 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 1070 million at august 27 2011 the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 

additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 351 million at august 27 2011 approximately 82 million is classified as current liabilities and 269 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 27 2011 

 

a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet the standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measure cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201028 intangibles — goodwill and other  which amends accounting standards codification “asc” topic 350 intangibles — goodwill and other  asu 201028 modifies step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts for those reporting units an entity is required to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment analysis if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists based on a qualitative assessment of adverse factors we do not expect the provisions of asu 201028 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements this update will be effective for our fiscal year ending august 25 2012 

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which amends asc topic 820 fair value measurement  the purpose of asu 201104 is to clarify the intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and to change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements we do not expect the provisions of asu 201104 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements this update will be effective as of our third quarter ending may 5 2012 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 presentation of comprehensive income  which amends asc topic 220 comprehensive income  the objective of asu 201105 is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income the update will require entities to present items of net income items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements and entities will no longer be allowed to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders’ equity reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income will be presented separately on the face of the financial statements we do not expect the provisions of asu 201105 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements this update will be effective for our fiscal year ending august 31 2013 

in august 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 intangibles — goodwill and other which amends asc topic 350 intangibles — goodwill and other  the purpose of asu 201108 is to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment entities will assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value in instances where the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value entities will perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we do not expect the provisions of asu 201108 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements this update will be effective for our fiscal year ending august 31 2013 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out “fifo” method for mexico inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 2533 million at august 27 2011 calculated using the dollar value method 

  29 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 20 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 27 2011 would have affected net income by approximately 7 million in fiscal 2011 

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had minimal writeoffs less than 500 thousand in any of the last three years 

selfinsurance reserves 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 1593 million at august 27 2011 and 1560 million at august 28 2010 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate 

  30 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 10 million for fiscal 2011 

as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly in fiscal 2011 we have experienced favorable claims development in our older policy years partially offset by increased severity and frequency of claims in the current policy year and have adjusted our estimates as necessary prior to fiscal 2011 we experienced favorable claims development particularly related to workers’ compensation claims we attribute this success to programs such as return to work and projects aimed at accelerating claims closure the programs have matured and proven to be effective and are therefore considered in our current and future assumptions regarding claims costs 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 2 million for fiscal 2011 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 27 2011 we had approximately 351 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

  31 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 27 2011 we have assumed an 8 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets for the fiscal year ending august 25 2012 we expect to assume a longterm rate of return on our plan assets of 75 due to a change in our asset allocation at august 27 2011 our plan assets totaled 157 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 780 thousand for the qualified plan 

discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2011 we assumed a discount rate of 513 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 27 2011 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 2 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings

as of august 28 2010 we held two forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 300 million subsequent to the fiscal year ended august 28 2010 we entered into a third forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of 100 million bringing the total notional amount of all outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps to 400 million these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 500 million senior note debt issuance during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 the swaps were benchmarked based on the 3month libor the three forward starting interest rate swaps expired in november 2010 and resulted in a loss of 74 million net of tax which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired therefore no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings at august 27 2011 we had no outstanding interest rate hedge instruments 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 3633 billion as of august 27 2011 and 3182 billion as of august 28 2010 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 2810 million and 2735 million at august 27 2011 and august 28 2010 respectively we had 6017 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 27 2011 and 4592 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 28 2010 in fiscal 2011 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 6 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 2750 billion at august 27 2011 and 2449 billion at august 28 2010 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 112 million at august 27 2011 

fuel price risk 

from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2010 during fiscal year 2009 we used a derivative financial instrument to economically hedge the commodity cost associated with our unleaded fuel the notional amount of the contract was 25 million gallons and terminated august 31 2009 the loss on the fuel contract for fiscal 2009 was 23 million 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 

our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars we generally view our investments in the mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net investment in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 2922 million at august 27 2011 and 2546 million at august 28 2010 the potential loss in value of our net investment in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 27 2011 and august 28 2010 amounted to approximately 27 million and approximately 23 million respectively any changes in our net investment in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

during fiscal 2011 exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso increased by approximately 43 with respect to the us dollar exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso increased by approximately 14 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2010

at august 28 2010 our stores were in the following locations

marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts and warranties that are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts that we sell the wide area network in our stores helps us expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes locate parts at neighboring autozone stores and in some cases place special orders directly with our vendors 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool ® program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of diy used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators 

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

  5 

we believe that the satisfaction of diy customers and professional technicians is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic product lines but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or to local satellite stores 

we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers demand 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service on many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes valucraft autozone duralast and duralast gold brands we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors 

brand advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty card programs primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico and mexico as a part of the program we offer delivery to our commercial customers as well as direct commercial sales through wwwautozoneprocom the program operated out of 2424 domestic stores and 173 of our mexico stores as of august 28 2010 through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians this additional inventory is available for our diy customers as well we have dedicated sales teams focused on national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

  6 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager autozoners typically have prior automotive experience all autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry although we do onthejob training we also provide formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives and commercial specialists receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and chihuahua mexico we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

store development 

the following table reflects store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older “our kind of vehicles” as these are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

  7 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and monterrey mexico in fiscal 2010 no class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales also during fiscal 2010 one vendor supplied 10 percent of our purchases no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we generally have few longterm contracts for the purchase of merchandise we believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store generally has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its coverage area within 24 hours additionally hub stores can provide replenishment of products sold to stores within its network hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in both the retail diy and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and products 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty store layouts location and convenience and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks 

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “valucraft” “alldata” “loanatool” and “znet” we believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing and merchandising strategies 

employees 

as of august 28 2010 we employed over 63000 persons approximately 56 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 91 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 5 percent in distribution centers and approximately 4 percent in store support and other functions included in the above numbers are approximately 3000 persons employed in our mexico operations 

we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our autozoners are generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face and that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected 

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors including 

 

 

 

 

  10 

 

 

 

for the long term demand for our products may be affected by 

 

 

all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and is based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

we may not be able to sustain our recent rate of sales growth 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 3673 stores at august 27 2005 to 4627 stores at august 28 2010 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 5711 billion in fiscal 2005 to 7363 billion in fiscal 2010 an average increase per year of 6 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and increases in samestore sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by continued job losses wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by continued recessionary pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or achieve increases in samestore sales 

  11 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

deterioration in the global credit markets changes in our credit ratings and macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could result in an increase in interest rates and more restrictive terms on certain of our senior debt and our commercial paper could limit our access to public debt markets could limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us and could significantly increase the interest rates on such facilities from current levels 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in calendar years 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009 there was no liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

macroeconomic conditions also impact both our customers and our suppliers continued recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses and business failures which could result in our loss of certain small business customers and curtailment of spending by our retail customers in addition continued distress in global credit markets business failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to obtain necessary short and longterm financing to meet our inventory demands moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs all of these macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees 

we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of our over 63000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and alldata we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers moreover if any of our significant vendors experiences financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales 

  12 

our largest stockholder as a result of its voting ownership may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders 

as of october 18 2010 esl investments inc and certain of its affiliates together “esl” beneficially owned approximately 347 of our outstanding common stock as a result esl may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders including the election of directors and potential change of control transactions in the future esl may acquire or sell shares of common stock and thereby increase or decrease its ownership stake in us significant fluctuations in their level of ownership could have an impact on our share price 

in june 2008 we entered into an agreement with esl the “esl agreement” in which esl has agreed to vote shares of our common stock owned by esl in excess of 375 in the same proportion as all noneslowned shares are voted additionally under the terms of the esl agreement the company added two directors in august 2008 that were identified by esl william c crowley one of the two directors identified by esl is the president and chief operating officer of esl investments inc 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

recently some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms allowing them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve efficiencies in their mergers that allow for more effective use of advertising and marketing dollars and allow them to more effectively compete for customers these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets and could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably 

in addition we extensively utilize hub stores our supply chains and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores if we fail to effectively utilize our existing distribution hubs andor supply chains we could experience inappropriate inventory levels in our stores which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand name our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise safety quality and integrity any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business 

war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our stores being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales canceled purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty 

we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations 

healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business 

the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act the “patient act” as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by congress and state legislatures may have an impact on our business while we are currently evaluating the potential effects of the patient act on our business the impact could be extensive and will most likely increase our employee healthcarerelated costs while the significant costs of the recent healthcare legislation enacted will occur after 2013 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time changes to our healthcare costs structure could have a significant negative impact on our business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a defendant in a lawsuit entitled “coalition for a level playing field llc et al v autozone inc et al” filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york in october 2004 the case was filed by more than 200 plaintiffs which are principally automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers against a number of defendants including automotive aftermarket retailers and aftermarket automotive parts manufacturers in the amended complaint the plaintiffs allege inter alia  that some or all of the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants have knowingly received in violation of the robinsonpatman act the “act” from various of the manufacturer defendants benefits such as volume discounts rebates early buy allowances and other allowances fees inventory without payment sham advertising and promotional payments a share in the manufacturers’ profits benefits of pay on scan purchases implementation of radio frequency identification technology and excessive payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers additionally a subset of plaintiffs alleges a claim of fraud against the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants based on discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar claims under the act in the prior litigation the discovery dispute as well as the underlying claims was decided in favor of autozone and the other automotive aftermarket retailer defendants who proceeded to trial pursuant to a unanimous jury verdict which was affirmed by the second circuit court of appeals in the current litigation the plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages including statutory trebling attorneys’ fees and a permanent injunction prohibiting the aftermarket retailer defendants from inducing andor knowingly receiving discriminatory prices from any of the aftermarket manufacturer defendants and from opening up any further stores to compete with the plaintiffs as long as the defendants allegedly continue to violate the act 

in an order dated september 7 2010 and issued on september 16 2010 the court granted motions to dismiss all claims against autozone and its codefendant competitors and suppliers based on the record in the prior litigation the court dismissed with prejudice all overlapping claims – that is those covering the same time periods covered by the prior litigation and brought by the judgment plaintiffs in the prior litigation the court also dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs’ attempt to revisit discovery disputes from the prior litigation further with respect to the other claims under the act the court found that the factual statements contained in the complaint fall short of what would be necessary to support a plausible inference of unlawful price discrimination finally the court held that the autozone payonscan program is a difference in nonprice terms that are not governed by the act the court ordered the case closed but also stated that “in an abundance of caution the court was deferring decision on whether to grant leave to amend to allow plaintiff an opportunity to propose curative amendments” without moving for leave to amend their complaint for a third time four plaintiffs filed a third amended and supplemental complaint the “third amended complaint” on october 18 2010 the third amended complaint repeats and expands certain allegations from previous complaints asserting two claims under the act but states that all other plaintiffs have withdrawn their claims and that inter alia  chief auto parts inc has been dismissed as a defendant the court set no specific procedure for further response or motion by the defendants we anticipate that the defendants including autozone will request that the court reject the third amended complaint andor will seek to have it dismissed 

we believe this suit to be without merit and are vigorously defending against it we are unable to estimate a loss or possible range of loss 

we are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business although the amount of liability that may result from these other proceedings cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories we began operations in 1979 and at august 28 2010 operated 4389 stores in the united states and puerto rico and 238 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 28 2010 in 2424 of our domestic stores and 173 of our mexico stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and as part of our commercial sales program through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

we achieved a strong performance in fiscal 2010 delivering record earnings of 738 million and sales growth of 546 million over the prior year we completed the year with strong growth in our commercial and retail businesses we are excited about our retail business opportunities and encouraged by the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and to refine our parts assortment there are various factors occurring within the current economy that affect both our customers and our industry including the impact of the recent recession the credit crisis and higher unemployment as consumers’ cash flows have decreased due to these factors we believe consumers have become more likely to keep their current vehicles longer and perform repair and maintenance in order to keep those vehicles well maintained our belief is supported by industry data showing an increase in the average age of vehicles on the road and recent declines in new car sales which we believe have led to an increase in demand for the products that we sell given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macro economic environment 

also we believe changes in gas prices impact our customers’ behavior with respect to driving and maintaining their cars with approximately ten billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the united states each 1 dollar decrease at the pump contributes approximately 10 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease in the future nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 

  19 

miles driven 

we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items prior to the recession we had seen a close correlation between annual miles driven and our annual net sales however this correlation has not existed in the recent shortterm recessionary period since the beginning of the fiscal year and through july 2010 latest publicly available information miles driven were relatively flat as compared to the comparable prior year period throughout this period and contrary to the correlation experienced prior to the recession sales have grown at an increased rate while miles driven have grown at a slower rate than what we have historically experienced we believe that the impact of changes in other factors primarily an increase in seven year old or older vehicles more than offset the impact of miles driven as the economy continues to recover we believe that annual miles driven will return to prerecession low single digit growth rates and the correlation between annual miles driven and the annual sales growth of our industry should return 

seven year old or older vehicles 

since 2008 new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to data provided by the automotive aftermarket industry association the number of seven year old or older vehicles increased by approximately 22 during the 2009 calendar year as compared to the 2008 calendar year as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products that we sell in the near term we expect this trend to continue as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy 

results of operations 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

for the fiscal year ended august 28 2010 we reported net sales of 7363 billion compared with 6817 billion for the year ended august 29 2009 an 80 increase from fiscal 2009 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 54 and sales from new stores of 2034 million the improvement in same store sales was driven by an improvement in transaction count trends while increases in average transaction value remained generally consistent with our longterm trends higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to both more complex costly products and commodity price increases 

at august 28 2010 we operated 4389 domestic stores and 238 stores in mexico compared with 4229 domestic stores and 188 stores in mexico at august 29 2009 we reported a domestic retail sales increase of 69 and a domestic commercial sales increase of 138 for fiscal 2010 

gross profit for fiscal 2010 was 3712 billion or 504 of net sales compared with 3416 billion or 501 of net sales for fiscal 2009 the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to leveraging distribution costs due to higher sales and operating efficiencies 19 basis points 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 increased to 2392 billion or 325 of net sales from 2240 billion or 329 of net sales for fiscal 2009 the reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of sales reflected leverage of store operating expenses due to higher sales partially offset by higher pension expense 17 basis points and the continued investment in the hub store initiative 16 basis points 

interest expense net for fiscal 2010 was 1589 million compared with 1423 million during fiscal 2009 this increase was due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period average borrowings for fiscal 2010 were 2752 billion compared with 2460 billion for fiscal 2009 and weighted average borrowing rates were 53 for fiscal 2010 compared to 54 for fiscal 2009 

our effective income tax rate was 364 of pretax income for fiscal 2010 compared to 364 for fiscal 2009 

net income for fiscal 2010 increased by 124 to 7383 million and diluted earnings per share increased 276 to 1497 from 1173 in fiscal 2009 the impact of the fiscal 2010 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 was an increase of approximately 074 

  20 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 

for the year ended august 29 2009 we reported net sales of 6817 billion compared with 6523 billion for the year ended august 30 2008 a 45 increase from fiscal 2008 excluding 1259 million of sales from the 53 rd week included in the prior year total company net sales increased 66 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 44 and sales from new stores of 1655 million the improvement in same store sales was driven by an improvement in transaction count trends while increases in average transaction value remained generally consistent with our longterm trends higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to both more complex costly products and commodity price increases 

at august 29 2009 we operated 4229 domestic stores and 188 stores in mexico compared with 4092 domestic stores and 148 stores in mexico at august 30 2008 excluding the sales from the 53 rd week in the prior year domestic retail sales increased 71 and domestic commercial sales increased 43 

gross profit for fiscal 2009 was 3416 billion or 501 of net sales compared with 3268 billion or 501 of net sales for fiscal 2008 gross profit as a percent of net sales was positively impacted by favorable distribution costs from improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs however this favorability was largely offset by a shift in mix to lower margin products 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 increased to 2240 billion or 329 of net sales from 2144 billion or 329 of net sales for fiscal 2008 leverage from increased sales was largely offset by expenses associated with our continued enhancements to our hub stores 17 basis points an acceleration of our store maintenance program 9 basis points and a continued expansion of our commercial sales force 7 basis points 

interest expense net for fiscal 2009 was 1423 million compared with 1167 million during fiscal 2008 this increase was due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and a higher percentage of fixed rate debt average borrowings for fiscal 2009 were 2460 billion compared with 2024 billion for fiscal 2008 and weighted average borrowing rates were 54 for fiscal 2009 compared to 52 for fiscal 2008 

our effective income tax rate was 364 of pretax income for fiscal 2009 compared to 363 for fiscal 2008 

net income for fiscal 2009 increased by 24 to 6570 million and diluted earnings per share increased 168 to 1173 from 1004 in fiscal 2008 the impact of the fiscal 2009 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was an increase of approximately 078 excluding the additional week in the prior year net income for the year increased 50 over the previous year while diluted earnings per share increased 197 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico and mexico 

each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consisted of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2010 16 weeks in 2009 and 17 weeks in 2008 because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 containing 16 weeks represented 332 of annual sales and 364 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 containing 16 weeks represented 327 of annual sales and 359 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 containing 17 weeks represented 339 of annual sales and 380 of net income

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 11963 million in fiscal 2010 9238 million in fiscal 2009 and 9211 million in fiscal 2008 the increase over prior year was primarily due to higher net income of 813 million and improvements in accounts payable as our cash flows from operating activities continue to benefit from our inventory purchases being largely financed by our vendors the increase in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to the growth in net income timing of income tax payments and deductions and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors finance a large portion of our inventory partially offsetting this increase were higher accounts receivable and the 53 rd week of income in fiscal 2008 we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 106 at august 28 2010 96 at august 29 2009 and 95 at august 30 2008 our inventory increases are primarily attributable to an increased number of stores and to a lesser extent our efforts to update product assortment in all of our stores many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortment by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue to grow accounts payable at a faster rate than inventory 

our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newstore development program from the beginning of fiscal 2008 to august 28 2010 we have opened 578 new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 3074 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 2637 million in fiscal 2009 and 2432 million in fiscal 2008 we invested 3154 million in capital assets in fiscal 2010 compared to 2722 million in capital assets in fiscal 2009 and 2436 million in capital assets in fiscal 2008 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores new store openings were 213 for fiscal 2010 180 for fiscal 2009 and 185 for fiscal 2008 we invest a portion of our assets held by the company’s wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we acquired 562 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2010 484 million in fiscal 2009 and 543 million in fiscal 2008 we had proceeds from marketable securities of 526 million in fiscal 2010 463 million in fiscal 2009 and 507 million in fiscal 2008 capital asset disposals provided 115 million in fiscal 2010 107 million in fiscal 2009 and 40 million in fiscal 2008 

net cash used in financing activities was 8835 million in fiscal 2010 8069 million in fiscal 2009 and 5227 million in fiscal 2008 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 11 billion for fiscal 2010 13 billion for fiscal 2009 and 8492 million for fiscal 2008 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations and at times by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 262 million for fiscal 2010 5000 million for fiscal 2009 and 7500 million for fiscal 2008 there were no debt repayments for fiscal 2010 debt repayments were 3007 million for fiscal 2009 and 2298 million for fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2009 we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness to prepay our 300 million term loan in august 2009 and for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases proceeds from the debt issuance in fiscal 2008 were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness and for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were 1554 million for fiscal 2010 and 2776 million for fiscal 2009 for fiscal 2008 net repayments of commercial paper were 2067 million 

we expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2011 with our investment being directed primarily to our newstore development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure the amount of our investments in our newstore program is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states or mexico or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 16 12 and 9 respectively as compared to the prior year our mix of store openings has moved away from buildtosuit leases lower cost to ground leases and land purchases higher cost resulting in increased capital expenditures during the previous three years and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august 27 2011 

in addition to the building and land costs our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate 

  22 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

for the fiscal year ended august 28 2010 our aftertax return on invested capital “roic” was 276 as compared to 244 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases roic increased primarily due to increased aftertax operating profit we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance 

debt facilities 

in july 2009 we terminated our 10 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2010 and replaced it with an 800 million revolving credit facility this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the credit facility may be increased to 10 billion at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 100 million in capital leases each fiscal year as the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit we had 3311 million in available capacity under this facility at august 28 2010 under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus the applicable percentage which could range from 150 basis points to 450 basis points depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans at the prime rate we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in july 2012 

the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 28 2010 was 4271 

in june 2010 we entered into a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit facility as of august 28 2010 we have 1000 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2013 

during august 2009 we elected to prepay without penalty the 300 million bank term loan entered in december 2004 and subsequently amended the term loan facility provided for a term loan which consisted of at our election base rate loans eurodollar loans or a combination thereof the entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan would be due and payable in full on december 23 2009 when the facility was scheduled to terminate interest accrued on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 12 of 1 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on december 29 2004 to effectively fix based on current debt ratings the interest rate of the term loan at 44 the outstanding liability associated with the interest rate swap totaled 36 million and was expensed in operating selling general and administrative expenses upon termination of the hedge in fiscal 2009 

  23 

on july 2 2009 we issued 500 million in 575 senior notes due 2015 under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july 29 2008 the “shelf registration” also on august 4 2008 we issued 500 million in 650 senior notes due 2014 and 250 million in 7125 senior notes due 2018 under the shelf registration the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions in fiscal 2009 the company used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness to prepay our 300 million term loan in august 2009 and for general corporate purposes proceeds from the debt issuance in fiscal 2008 were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 

the 575 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 650 and 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the “notes” are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded they also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

as of august 28 2010 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future 

our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense “ebitdar” ratio was 241 and 251 as of august 28 2010 and august 29 2009 respectively we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the program was amended in june 2010 to increase the repurchase authorization to 89 billion from 84 billion from january 1998 to august 28 2010 we have repurchased a total of 1217 million shares at an aggregate cost of 87 billion we repurchased 64 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 11 billion during fiscal 2010 93 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 13 billion during fiscal 2009 and 68 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 8492 million during fiscal 2008 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 28 2010 we have 1854 million remaining under the board of director’s authorization to repurchase our common stock 

on september 28 2010 the board of directors voted to increase the authorization by 500 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 89 billion to 94 billion we have repurchased approximately 800 thousand shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of 1859 million during fiscal 2011

financial commitments 

the following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of august 28 2010 

 

 we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account as of august 28 2010 our pension liability is 2115 million and our pension assets are valued at 1172 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 943 million at august 28 2010 these amounts will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless they are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 

additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 465 million at august 28 2010 approximately 284 million is classified as current liabilities and 181 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of these tax positions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 28 2010 

 

a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet the standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

  25 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board of directors use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measure cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt

 reconciliation of nongaap financial measure fiscal 2008 results excluding impact of 53 rd week 

the following table summarizes the favorable impact of the additional week included in the 53week fiscal year ended august 30 2008 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 200913 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which amends accounting standards codification “asc” topic 605 formerly emerging issues task force issue no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  this asu addresses the accounting for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements to enable vendors to account for deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit this asu will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into commencing with our first fiscal quarter beginning august 29 2010 we do not expect the provisions of asu 200913 to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

  27 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out “fifo” method for mexico inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 2473 million at august 28 2010 calculated using the dollar value method 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 20 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 25 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 28 2010 would have affected net income by approximately 5 million in fiscal 2010 

vendor allowances 

we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 85 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

  28 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had minimal writeoffs less than 100 thousand in any of the last three years 

selfinsurance 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle insurance losses and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 156 million 158 million and 145 million as of the end of fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively these changes are primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history we have experienced improvements in frequency and duration of claims however medical and wage inflation have partially offset these trends throughout this time our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and these trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 10 million for fiscal 2010 

as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly in recent years we have experienced favorable claims development particularly related to workers’ compensation and have adjusted our estimates as necessary we attribute this success to programs such as return to work and projects aimed at accelerating claims closure the programs have matured and proven to be successful and are therefore considered in our current and future assumptions regarding claims costs 

our liabilities for workers’ compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have changed approximately 2 million for fiscal 2010 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

  29 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 28 2010 we had approximately 465 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings in accordance with asc topic 740 formerly financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we have assumed an 8 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets at august 28 2010 our plan assets totaled 117 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 600 thousand for the qualified plan 

discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2010 we assumed a discount rate of 525 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 28 2010 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 22 million for the qualified plan and 40 thousand for the nonqualified plan 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our board of directors further we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes 

  30 

interest rate risk 

our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings 

at august 28 2010 we held forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 300 million these agreements which expire in november of 2010 are used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates relating to anticipated debt transactions it is expected that upon settlement of the agreements the realized gain or loss will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt during fiscal 2009 we terminated an interest rate swap related to a 300 million term loan that was prepaid as a result at august 29 2009 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 3182 billion as of august 28 2010 and 2853 billion as of august 29 2009 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 2735 million and 1265 million at august 28 2010 and august 29 2009 respectively we had 4592 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 28 2010 and 2776 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 29 2009 in fiscal 2010 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of 46 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 2449 billion at august 28 2010 and august 29 2009 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by 942 million at august 28 2010 

fuel price risk 

fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during the 2010 fiscal year during fiscal year 2009 we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our unleaded fuel exposure as of august 29 2009 we had an outstanding liability of less than one hundred thousand dollars associated with our unleaded fuel swap which had no significant impact on our results of operations 

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 

our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars we generally view our investments in the mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net investment in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 2546 million at august 28 2010 and 2154 million at august 29 2009 the potential loss in value of our net investment in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 28 2010 and august 29 2009 amounted to 231 million and 196 million respectively any changes in our net investment in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

during fiscal 2010 exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso increased by approximately 14 with respect to the us dollar exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 30 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2009

marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and quality automotive parts and products at a great value in conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts and warranties are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts we sell our wide area network in our stores helps us to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to locate parts at neighboring autozone stores and in some cases to place special orders directly with our vendors 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool ® program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a doityourself “diy” customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings where allowed by law battery charging the collection of diy used oil for recycling and the testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators 

merchandising 

the following tables show some of the types of products that we sell by major category of items 

 

  5 

we believe that the satisfaction of diy customers and professional technicians is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic product lines but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or to local satellite stores 

we are constantly updating the products that we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products that our customers demand 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a good warranty and outstanding customer service on many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands valucraft autozone duralast and duralast gold we believe that our overall value compares favorably to those of our competitors 

brand advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions and advertising primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast media is our primary advertising method of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and the shelf 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico and mexico as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to our commercial customers the program operates out of 2303 domestic stores as of august 29 2009 through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians this additional inventory is available for our diy customers as well we have sales teams focused on national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

  6 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager autozoners typically have prior automotive experience all autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry although we do onthejob training we also provide formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from both the company and from independent certification agencies training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives and commercial specialists receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both autozoners and customers can view the screen in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions simplified warranty and product return procedures 

store development 

the following table reflects store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

the domestic stores include stores in the united states and puerto rico we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older “our kind of vehicles” as these are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

  7 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico in fiscal 2009 no class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales nor did any single supplier account for more than 10 percent of our total purchases we generally have few longterm contracts for the purchase of merchandise we believe that we have good relationships with suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store is able to provide replenishment of products sold and deliver other products maintained only in hub store inventories to a store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in both the retail doityourself “diy” and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise selection and availability price product warranty store layouts and location 

trademarks and patents

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face and that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

continued deterioration in the global credit markets changes in our credit ratings and macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could result in an increase in interest rates and more restrictive terms on certain of our senior debt and our commercial paper could limit our access to public debt markets could limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us and could significantly increase the interest rates on such facilities from current levels 

  10 

moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions has resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in higher shortterm borrowing costs and more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009 there was no liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinary high interest rates on commercial paper persistent recessionary conditions around the world could continue to affect the cost and availability of debt we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt 

macroeconomic conditions also impact both our customers and our suppliers continued recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses and business failures which could result in our loss of certain small business customers and curtailment of spending by our retail customers in addition continued distress in global credit markets business failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to meet our inventory demands all of these macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 

we may not be able to sustain our recent rate of sales growth 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 3483 stores at august 28 2004 to 4417 stores at august 29 2009 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 5637 billion in fiscal 2004 to 6817 billion in fiscal 2009 an average increase per year of 4 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and increases in samestore sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by continued job losses wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry some of our new store openings are expected to be in mexico where legal and political factors can adversely affect our ability to obtain sites or permits to operate new stores same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by continued recessionary pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or achieve increases in samestore sales 

our business depends upon qualified employees 

at the end of fiscal 2009 our consolidated employee count was approximately 60000 we cannot assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected 

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors including 

 

 

 

 

  11 

 

 

for the long term demand for our products may depend upon 

 

 

all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and is based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a supplier in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty and distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

recently some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms allowing them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to achieve efficiencies in their mergers that allow for more effective use of advertising and marketing dollars and allow them to more effectively compete for customers these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets and could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business 

  12 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 

rising energy prices may negatively impact our profitability 

as mentioned above rising energy prices may impact demand for the products that we sell overall transaction count and our profitability higher energy prices impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs 

our largest stockholder as a result of its voting ownership may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders 

as of october 19 2009 esl investments inc and certain of its investment affiliates together “esl” beneficially owned approximately 40 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result esl may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders including the election of directors and any transactions involving a change of control 

in the future esl may acquire or sell shares of common stock and thereby increase or decrease its ownership stake in us significant fluctuations in their level of ownership could have an impact on our share price 

in june 2008 we entered into an agreement with esl the “esl agreement” in which esl has agreed to vote shares of our common stock owned by esl in excess of 40 in the same proportion as all noneslowned shares are voted following the annual meeting of stockholders of the company for the fiscal year ending on august 29 2009 the applicable percentage threshold is reduced from 40 to 375 of the then outstanding common stock additionally under the terms of the agreement the company added two directors in august 2008 that were identified by esl william c crowley one of the two appointed directors is the president and chief operating officer of esl investments inc the esl agreement is filed as exhibit 1022 to this form 10k

autozone is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business although the amount of liability that may result from these other proceedings cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories we began operations in 1979 and at august 29 2009 operated 4229 stores in the united states and puerto rico and 188 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 29 2009 in 2303 of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and as part of our commercial sales program through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

executive summary 

we achieved a solid performance in fiscal 2009 delivering record earnings of 657 million and sales growth of 420 million over the prior year excluding the 53 rd week in last year’s results we completed the year with strong growth in our commercial and retail businesses we are excited about our retail business opportunities and encouraged by the increase in our commercial business where we continued to build our internal sales force and to refine our parts assortment there are various factors occuring within the current economy that affect both our customers and our industry including the credit crisis and higher unemployment which we believe when combined have aided our sales growth during the year we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macro economic environment 

the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road miles driven declined for the sixteenth straight month in march were relatively flat in april and may before increasing in june and july we are optimistic that over the longterm this trend will stabilize at low single digit increases as the number of vehicles on the road continues to increase 

new vehicle sales declined significantly during 2008 and the first half of 2009 which we believe is contributing to an increasing number of “seven year old or older” vehicles on the road in the near term we expect this trend to continue as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy also we believe gas prices impact our customers’ behavior with respect to driving and maintaining their cars with approximately ten billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the united states each 1 dollar decrease at the pump contributes approximately 10 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month during the summer of 2008 gas prices peaked at roughly 4 per gallon before falling to 2 per gallon in february 2009 by the end of fiscal 2009 gas prices had risen to approximately 261 per gallon 

during fiscal 2009 we worked hard to execute on several key initiatives as the macro environment turned in our industry’s favor and we saw an increase in traffic in our stores 

we significantly enhanced the utilization of our hub stores by refining and improving the product assortment in these locations while simultaneously increasing the delivery frequency to nearby stores we accelerated our store maintenance efforts and also deployed additional capital in areas that we expect to yield benefits in the future such as enhancing our it infrastructure and continued additions of late model products we also began an effort to purchase more of our new store locations rather than leasing them finally we maintained our focus on developing a first class commercial field sales organization by continuing to expand the size of our team and investing in training tools and management programs 

in this challenging environment we continue to see sales of maintenance and failure categories perform well while discretionary categories are being negatively impacted consequently we remain focused on refining and expanding our product assortment to ensure we have the “best” merchandise at the “right” price in each of our merchandise categories

results of operations 

fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 

for the year ended august 29 2009 autozone reported net sales of 6817 billion compared with 6523 billion for the year ended august 30 2008 a 45 increase from fiscal 2008 excluding 1259 million of sales from the 53 rd week included in the prior year total company net sales increased 66 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 44 and sales from new stores of 1655 million the improvement in same store sales was driven by an improvement in transaction count trends while increases in average transaction value remained generally consistent with our longterm trends higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to both more complex costly products and commodity price increases 

at august 29 2009 we operated 4229 domestic stores and 188 stores in mexico compared with 4092 domestic stores and 148 stores in mexico at august 30 2008 excluding the sales from the 53 rd week in the prior year domestic retail sales increased 71 and domestic commercial sales increased 43 

gross profit for fiscal 2009 was 3416 billion or 501 of net sales compared with 3268 billion or 501 of net sales for fiscal 2008 gross profit as a percent of net sales was positively impacted by favorable distribution costs from improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs however this favorability was largely offset by a shift in mix to lower margin products 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 increased to 2240 billion or 329 of net sales from 2144 billion or 329 of net sales for fiscal 2008 leverage from increased sales was largely offset by expenses associated with our continued enhancements to our hub stores an acceleration of our store maintenance program and a continued expansion of our commercial sales force 

interest expense net for fiscal 2009 was 1423 million compared with 1167 million during fiscal 2008 this increase was due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and a higher percentage of fixed rate debt average borrowings for fiscal 2009 were 2460 billion compared with 2024 billion for fiscal 2008 and weighted average borrowing rates were 54 for fiscal 2009 compared to 52 for fiscal 2008 

our effective income tax rate was 364 of pretax income for fiscal 2009 compared to 363 for fiscal 2008 refer to “note d — income taxes” for additional information regarding our income tax rate 

net income for fiscal 2009 increased by 24 to 6570 million and diluted earnings per share increased 168 to 1173 from 1004 in fiscal 2008 the impact of the fiscal 2009 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was an increase of approximately 078 excluding the additional week in the prior year net income for the year increased 50 over the previous year while diluted earnings per share increased 197 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

for the year ended august 30 2008 autozone reported net sales of 6523 billion compared with 6170 billion for the year ended august 25 2007 a 57 increase from fiscal 2007 this growth was primarily driven by net sales of 1666 million for fiscal 2008 from new stores 1259 million or a 19 increase from the addition of the 53 rd week and a domestic same store sales excluding 53 rd week increase of 04 at august 30 2008 we operated 4092 domestic stores and 148 in mexico compared with 3933 domestic stores and 123 in mexico at august 25 2007 the domestic same store sales increase was driven by higher average transaction value partially offset by lower transaction count higher transaction value was primarily attributable to product price inflation due both to more complex costly products and to commodity price increases transaction counts were lower due to a combination of factors including product life cycles and deferred maintenance including the 53 rd week domestic retail sales increased 45 and domestic commercial sales increased 68 from prior year alldata and mexico sales including the 53 rd week increased over prior year contributing 12 percentage points of the total increase in net sales 

gross profit for fiscal 2008 was 3268 billion or 501 of net sales compared with 3064 billion or 497 of net sales for fiscal 2007 the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales was primarily due to an approximately 50 basis point benefit from category management efforts including increases in average retail prices of products sold and vendor supported promotional activities these efforts were partially offset by increased distribution expense principally relating to higher fuel costs 

  20 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 increased to 2144 billion or 329 of net sales from 2009 billion or 326 of net sales for fiscal 2007 approximately 20 basis points of the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was due to higher employee medical expense driven by an increase in the number of catastrophic claims the remaining increase was primarily due to higher fuel expense for our commercial fleet from increased fuel prices approximately 6 basis points of the increase 

interest expense net for fiscal 2008 was 1167 million compared with 1191 million during fiscal 2007 this decrease was primarily due to lower shortterm rates and was offset by higher average borrowing levels over the comparable fiscal 2007 period and the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2008 average borrowings for fiscal 2008 were 2024 billion compared with 1972 billion for fiscal 2007 weighted average borrowing rates were 52 at august 30 2008 compared to 57 at august 25 2007 

our effective income tax rate was 363 of pretax income for fiscal 2008 compared to 364 for fiscal 2007 

net income for fiscal 2008 increased by 77 to 6416 million and diluted earnings per share increased 178 to 1004 from 853 in fiscal 2007 the impact of the fiscal 2008 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008 was an increase of approximately 029 excluding the additional week net income for the year increased 51 over the previous year to 6258 million while diluted earnings per share increased 149 to 980 per share 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

autozone’s business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of march through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december through february during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico and mexico 

each of the first three quarters of autozone’s fiscal year consisted of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2009 17 weeks in 2008 and 16 weeks in 2007 because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 containing 16 weeks represented 327 of annual sales and 359 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 containing 17 weeks represented 339 of annual sales and 380 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 containing 16 weeks represented 325 of annual sales and 365 of net income

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 9238 million in fiscal 2009 9211 million in fiscal 2008 and 8452 million in fiscal 2007 the increase over prior year was primarily due to the growth in net income and to a lesser extent timing of income tax payments and deductions and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors continue to finance a large portion of our inventory partially offsetting this increase were higher accounts receivable and the 53 rd week of income in last year’s sales the increase in fiscal 2008 verses fiscal 2007 was due primarily to higher net income and an increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 96 at august 29 2009 95 at august 30 2008 and 93 at august 25 2007 our inventory increases are primarily attributable to an increased number of stores and to a lesser extent our efforts to update product assortment in all of our stores additionally many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortment by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to grow accounts payable at a faster rate than inventory 

  21 

autozone’s primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program from the beginning of fiscal 2007 to august 29 2009 we have opened 551 new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 2637 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 2432 million in fiscal 2008 and 2287 million in fiscal 2007 we invested 2722 million in capital assets in fiscal 2009 compared to 2436 million in capital assets in fiscal 2008 and 2245 million in capital assets in fiscal 2007 the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to the types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores new store openings were 180 for fiscal 2009 185 for fiscal 2008 and 186 for fiscal 2007 we invest a portion of our assets held by the company’s wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we acquired 484 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2009 543 million in fiscal 2008 and 946 million in fiscal 2007 we had proceeds from matured marketable securities of 463 million in fiscal 2009 507 million in fiscal 2008 and 869 million in fiscal 2007 capital asset disposals provided 107 million in fiscal 2009 40 million in fiscal 2008 and 35 million in fiscal 2007 

net cash used in financing activities was 8069 million in fiscal 2009 5227 million in fiscal 2008 and 6214 million in fiscal 2007 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 13 billion for fiscal 2009 8492 million for fiscal 2008 and 7619 million for fiscal 2007 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations and at times by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 5000 million for fiscal 2009 7500 million for fiscal 2008 and none for fiscal 2007 debt repayments totaled 3007 million for fiscal 2009 2298 million for fiscal 2008 and 58 million for fiscal 2007 as discussed in “note hfinancing” in july 2009 we issued 5000 million in 575 senior notes due 2015 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness to prepay our 300 million term loan in august 2009 and for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures new store openings and stock repurchases net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were 2776 million for fiscal 2009 and 843 million for fiscal 2007 for fiscal 2008 net repayments of commercial paper were 2067 million 

we expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2010 primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure in addition to the building and land costs our new store development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be impacted by a prolonged tightening of the credit markets which may directly limit our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

credit ratings 

at august 29 2009 autozone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and a commercial paper rating of a2 moody’s investors service had assigned the company a senior unsecured debt credit rating of baa2 and a commercial paper rating of p2 fitch ratings assigned the company a bbb rating for senior unsecured debt and an f2 rating for commercial paper as of august 29 2009 moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch had autozone listed as having a “stable” outlook if our credit ratings drop our interest expense will increase similarly we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will likely increase as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit if our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade our access to financing may become more limited

debt facilities 

in july 2009 we terminated our 10 billion revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2010 and replaced it with an 800 million revolving credit facility this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the credit facility may be increased to 10 billion at autozone’s election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 100 million in capital leases each fiscal year as the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit the company had 4105 million in available capacity under this facility at august 29 2009 interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage which could range from 150 basis points to 450 basis points depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating this facility expires in july 2012 

during august 2009 we elected to prepay without penalty our 300 million bank term loan entered in december 2004 and subsequently amended the term loan facility provided for a term loan which consisted of at our election base rate loans eurodollar loans or a combination thereof the entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan was due and payable in full on december 23 2009 when the facility was scheduled to terminate we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on december 29 2004 to effectively fix based on current debt ratings the interest rate of the term loan at 44 the outstanding liability associated with the interest rate swap totaled 36 million and was expensed in operating selling general and administrative expenses upon termination of the hedge in fiscal 2009 

on june 25 2008 we entered into an agreement with esl investments inc the “esl agreement” setting forth certain understandings and agreements regarding the voting by esl investments inc on behalf of itself and its affiliates collectively “esl” of certain shares of common stock of autozone inc and related matters among other things we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to increase our adjusted debtebitdar target ratio from 211 to 251 no later than february 14 2009 we met this commitment at february 14 2009 we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and annual rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and stock option expenses to net income at august 29 2009 our adjusted debtebitdar ratio was 251 the esl agreement is filed as exhibit 1022 to this form 10k 

on august 4 2008 we issued 500 million in 650 senior notes due 2014 and 250 million in 7125 senior notes due 2018 under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july 29 2008 the “shelf registration” that shelf registration allowed us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions 

on july 2 2009 we issued 500 million in 575 senior notes due 2015 under the shelf registration we used the proceeds to pay down our commercial paper borrowings to prepay in full our 300 million term loan in august 2009 and the remainder for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures new store openings and stock repurchases 

the 650 and 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 and the 575 senior notes issued in july 2009 are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded they also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if autozone experiences a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our other borrowing arrangements covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 

the 800 million revolving credit agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 29 2009 was 4191 as of august 29 2009 we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants 

  23 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the program was last amended in june 2009 to increase the repurchase authorization to 79 billion from 74 billion from january 1998 to august 29 2009 we have repurchased a total of 1154 million shares at an aggregate cost of 76 billion we repurchased 93 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 13 billion during fiscal 2009 68 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 8492 million during fiscal 2008 and 60 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 7619 million during fiscal 2007 

from august 30 2009 to october 26 2009 we repurchased 12 million shares for 1782 million 

financial commitments 

the following table shows autozone’s significant contractual obligations as of august 29 2009 

 

 we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account as disclosed in “note k — pension and savings plans” our pension liability is 1856 million and our pension assets are 1153 million at august 29 2009 

additionally as disclosed in “note d — income taxes” our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 566 million at august 29 2009 approximately 259 million is classified as short term and 307 million is classified as long term we did not reflect these obligations in the financial commitments table as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of these tax positions 

  24 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 29 2009 

 

a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet the standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

in conjunction with our commercial sales program we offer credit to some of our commercial customers historically certain of the receivables related to this credit program were sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse at august 30 2008 we had 554 million outstanding under this program during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 autozone terminated its agreement to sell receivables to a third party there were no amounts outstanding under this program as of august 29 2009 

value of pension assets 

at august 29 2009 the fair market value of autozone’s pension assets was 1153 million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was 1856 million based on an august 29 2009 measurement date on january 1 2003 our defined benefit pension plans were frozen accordingly plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas and no new participants may join the plans the material assumptions for fiscal 2009 are an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 80 and a discount rate of 624 for additional information regarding autozone’s qualified and nonqualified pension plans refer to “note k — pension and savings plans” in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the company’s comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board of directors use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb statement no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans collectively postretirement benefit plans to recognize the funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in the statement of financial position measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal yearend statement of financial position and provide additional disclosures 

on august 25 2007 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions and on august 31 2008 we adopted the measurement date provisions the adoption of these provisions had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements refer to “note kpension and savings plans” for further description of these adoptions 

on august 31 2008 we adopted fasb statement no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” this new standard defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements there is a oneyear deferral of the adoption of this standard as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued fasb statement 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” this standard significantly changes the accounting for and reporting of business combinations in consolidated financial statements among other things sfas 141r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date and requires the expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs the standard is effective for us beginning august 30 2009 and is applicable only to transactions occurring after the effective date 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 133” “sfas 161” sfas 161 amends sfas no 133 to improve the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities by providing enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 133 and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows the adoption of sfas 161 did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in april 2009 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 1071 “fsp 1071” and accounting principles board opinion no 281 “apb 281” “interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” amending the disclosure requirements in sfas 107 and apb opinion 28 fsp 1071 and apb 281 require disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods in addition to annual reporting periods these disclosures will be required commencing with our fiscal quarter beginning august 30 2009 

in may 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 165 “subsequent events” “sfas 165” which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued specifically sfas 165 sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date we adopted sfas 165 on august 29 2009 and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued 

in june 2009 the fasb voted to approve the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles the codification will be effective for us commencing with our fiscal quarter beginning august 30 2009 the fasb codification does not change us generally accepted accounting principles but combines all authoritative standards such as those issued by the fasb american institute of certified public accountants and the emerging issues task force into a comprehensive topically organized online database

critical accounting estimates 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory reserves and cost of sales 

lifo 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout “lifo” method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out fifo method for mexico inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 2230 million at august 29 2009 calculated using the dollar value method 

inventory obsolescence and shrinkage 

our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items and accessoriesnonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 15 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on management’s judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 

historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 

additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 25 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate 

each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use 

a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 29 2009 would have affected net income by approximately 3 million in fiscal 2009 

  29 

vendor allowances 

autozone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products approximately 90 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 

based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases therefore we record receivables for funding not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had minimal writeoffs less than 100 thousand in any of the last three years and these writeoffs were due to severed relationships 

selfinsurance 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation vehicle employee health general and products liability and property losses and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 158 million 145 million and 133 million as of the end of fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these increases are primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation and increases in vehicles and the number of hours worked 

the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history we have experienced improvements in frequency and duration of claims however medical and wage inflation have partially offset these trends throughout this time our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and these trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates 

management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 10 million for fiscal 2009 

as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly in recent years we have experienced favorable claims development particularly related to workers compensation and have adjusted our estimates accordingly we attribute this success to programs such as return to work and projects aimed at accelerating claims closure the programs have matured and proven to be successful and are therefore considered in our current and future assumptions regarding claims costs 

our liabilities for workers compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our balance sheet using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have changed approximately 2 million at august 29 2009 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

  30 

income taxes 

our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and experience with previous similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 29 2009 we had approximately 566 million reserved for uncertain tax positions 

we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings in accordance with fin 48 by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of certain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 the company’s supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

i expected longterm rate of return on plan assets as described more fully in “note k — pension and savings plans” we have assumed an 8 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets at august 29 2009 our plan assets totaled 115 million in our qualified plan we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 570 thousand for the qualified plan 

ii discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2009 we assumed a discount rate of 624 a decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 29 2009 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 19 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

autozone is exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our board of directors further we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

autozone’s financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

autozone has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets or liabilities all of the company’s interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges we had an outstanding interest rate swap with a negative fair value of 43 million at august 30 2008 to effectively fix the interest rate on the 300 million term loan entered into during december 2004 during the current fiscal year we prepaid the term loan and terminated the interest rate swap as a result at august 29 2009 we had no outstanding interest rate swaps 

unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income for further discussion see “note gderivative financial instruments” 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 2853 billion as of august 29 2009 and 2235 billion as of august 30 2008 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to autozone for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 1265 million at august 29 2009 and less than the carrying value of debt by 150 million at august 30 2008 we had 2776 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 29 2009 and considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge no variable rate debt outstanding at august 30 2008 in fiscal 2009 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of 28 million which includes the effects of the interest rate swap the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 2449 billion at august 29 2009 and considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge 2250 billion at august 30 2008 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by 1059 million at august 29 2009 and 907 million at august 30 2008 

fuel price risk 

fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas 133 and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure in fiscal year 2009 we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our unleaded fuel exposure we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during the 2008 fiscal year and during fiscal year 2007 we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our unleaded and diesel fuel exposures as of august 29 2009 we had an outstanding liability of less than one hundred thousand dollars associated with our unleaded fuel swap and no outstanding fuel swap contracts at august 25 2007 the swaps during fiscal years 2009 and 2007 had no significant impact on our results of operations in either year

foreign currency risk 

foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency the company and its subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 

the company’s primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars the company generally views as longterm its investments in the mexican subsidiaries which have the mexican peso as the functional currency as a result the company generally does not hedge these net investments the net investment in mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 2154 million at august 29 2009 and 1608 million at august 30 2008 the potential loss in value of the company’s net investment in mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 29 2009 and august 30 2008 amounted to 196 million and 146 million respectively this change would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the company’s consolidated balance sheets unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 

during 2009 exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 30 with respect to the us dollar the resulting foreign currency translation losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss

marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service value and quality automotive parts and products at conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts and warranties are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts we sell our wide area network in our stores helps us to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to locate parts at neighboring autozone stores and in some cases to place special orders directly with our vendors 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool ® program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a diy customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings battery charging oil recycling and testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators 

merchandising 

the following table shows some of the types of products that we sell 

 

  5 

we believe that the satisfaction of diy customers and professional technicians is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic product lines but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or local satellite stores 

we are constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our inventory matches the products that our customers demand 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a good warranty and outstanding customer service on many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key component is our exclusive line of inhouse brands valucraft autozone duralast and duralast gold we believe that our overall prices and value compare favorably to those of our competitors 

marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions and advertising primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcasting is our primary marketing method of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for a high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors maintenance products accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and on the shelf 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and is one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and government agencies in the united states puerto rico and mexico as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to our commercial customers the program operated out of 2236 domestic stores as of august 30 2008 through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians and this additional inventory is available for our diy customers as well we have sales teams focused on national regional and public sector commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

  6 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager autozoners typically have prior automotive experience all autozoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry although we do onthejob training we also provide formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from both the company and from independent certification agencies training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers sales representatives and commercial specialists receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have znet ®  our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts our customers need and provides complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet ® provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet ® display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both autozoners and customers can view the screen in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access immediately national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

store development 

the following table reflects store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

the domestic stores include stores in the united states and puerto rico we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older “our kind of vehicles” as these are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

  7 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico no one class of product accounts for as much as 10 percent of our total sales in fiscal 2008 no single supplier accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases we generally have few longterm contracts for the purchase of merchandise we believe that we have good relationships with suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores a hub store is able to provide replenishment of products sold and deliver other products maintained only in hub store inventories to a store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in both the retail “diy” and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise selection and availability price product warranty store layouts and location 

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “valucraft” “alldata” and “znet ® ” we believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our merchandising and marketing strategy 

employees 

as of august 30 2008 we employed approximately 57000 persons approximately 57 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 91 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 6 percent in distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support functions included in the above numbers are approximately 2600 persons employed in our mexico operations 

we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our autozoners are generally good

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face and that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

we may not be able to sustain our recent rate of sales growth 

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 3268 stores at august 30 2003 to 4240 stores at august 30 2008 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 5457 billion in fiscal 2003 to 6523 billion in fiscal 2008 an average increase per year of 4 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and samestore sales we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores or increase samestore sales 

  10 

our business depends upon qualified employees 

at the end of fiscal 2008 our consolidated employee count was approximately 57000 we cannot assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected 

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors in the short term it may depend upon 

 

for the long term demand for our products may depend upon 

 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are rapidly opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a supplier in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

  11 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty and distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories we can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers 

if our vendors continue to consolidate we may pay higher prices for our merchandise 

in recent years several of our vendors have merged further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 

recently some of our competitors have merged if this trend continues or they are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are stronger 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 

rising energy prices may negatively impact our profitability 

as mentioned above rising energy prices may impact demand for the products that we sell overall transaction count and our profitability higher energy prices impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs 

demand for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make available the information our customers need to work on their own vehicles 

demand for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make available to the automotive aftermarket industry diagnostic repair and maintenance information that our customers both retail “diy” and commercial “difm” require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles without public dissemination of this information consumers may be forced to have all diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers’ dealer network 

  12 

deteriorating conditions in the global credit markets changes in our credit ratings and macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could result in an increase in interest rates and more restrictive terms on certain of our senior debt and our commercial paper could limit our access to public debt markets could limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us and could significantly increase the interest rates on such facilities from current levels 

moreover over the past several months significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions has resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability in global credit markets and in higher shortterm borrowing costs and more stringent borrowing terms recessionary conditions in the global economy threaten to cause further tightening of the credit markets more stringent lending standards and terms and higher volatility in interest rates persistence of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt in addition further deterioration in the us economy could adversely affect our corporate results which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

autozone inc is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled “coalition for a level playing field llc et al v autozone inc et al” filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york in october 2004 the case was filed by more than 200 plaintiffs which are principally automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers collectively “plaintiffs” against a number of defendants including automotive aftermarket retailers and aftermarket automotive parts manufacturers in the amended complaint the plaintiffs allege inter alia that some or all of the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants have knowingly received in violation of the robinsonpatman act the “act” from various of the manufacturer defendants benefits such as volume discounts rebates early buy allowances and other allowances fees inventory without payment sham advertising and promotional payments a share in the manufacturers’ profits benefits of pay on scan purchases implementation of radio frequency identification technology and excessive payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers additionally a subset of plaintiffs alleges a claim of fraud against the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants based on discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar robinsonpatman act claims in the prior litigation the discovery dispute as well as the underlying claims were decided in favor of autozone and the other automotive aftermarket retailer defendants who proceeded to trial pursuant to a unanimous jury verdict which was affirmed by the second circuit court of appeals in the current litigation plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages including statutory trebling attorneys’ fees and a permanent injunction prohibiting the aftermarket retailer defendants from inducing andor knowingly receiving discriminatory prices from any of the aftermarket manufacturer defendants and from opening up any further stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as defendants allegedly continue to violate the act the company believes this suit to be without merit and is vigorously defending against it defendants have filed motions to dismiss all claims with prejudice on substantive and procedural grounds additionally the defendants have sought to enjoin plaintiffs from filing similar lawsuits in the future if granted in their entirety these dispositive motions would resolve the litigation in defendants’ favor 

autozone is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business although the amount of liability that may result from these other proceedings cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are the nation’s leading specialty retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories we began operations in 1979 and at august 30 2008 operated 4092 stores in the united states and puerto rico and 148 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products in many of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers and service stations we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software on the web we sell diagnostic and repair information and automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation 

executive summary 

autozone achieved a solid performance in fiscal 2008 delivering record earnings of 642 million and sales growth of 353 million over the prior year we completed the fiscal year with solid growth in our commercial sales and an increase in our retail sales we are encouraged by the increase in our commercial business and remain focused on strengthening our retail business we believe the challenging macro environment including increases in gas prices the credit crisis and higher unemployment has impacted our customers based on the current macro environment we continue to communicate to our customers our extensive product categories that are focused on improving gas mileage and saving money by performing maintenance on their vehicles 

we believe the two statistics that have the closest correlation to our market growth are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road miles driven declined for the ninth straight month in july 2008 august data is not yet available we believe higher gas prices have contributed to these trends conversely the number of older vehicles seven years old or older on the road has continued to increase annually we currently do not believe the combined impact of these trends to be material to our business 

key initiatives — during fiscal 2008 we continued to reinforce the importance of improving the customer shopping experience by focusing on continuous training on product knowledge leadership and most importantly our culture of customer satisfaction additionally we made steady progress on our category management initiatives by making enhancements to our merchandise assortment planning tools updating category line reviews expanding our parts assortment and increasing retail prices to help mitigate the exposure to our business from increased costs also we maintained our focus on commercial sales training to develop a first class commercial field sales organization lastly we continued to gain traction on our new electronic parts catalogue znet ®  by improving its capabilities and highlighting this customer service enhancement in our marketing campaign 

we continue to see our customers being more cautious with their buying habits in the midst of a challenging environment however we believe we are well positioned moving into fiscal 2009 and are confident we can continue offering a value proposition that is compelling to our customers  

results of operations 

fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

for the year ended august 30 2008 autozone reported net sales of 6523 billion compared with 6170 billion for the year ended august 25 2007 a 57 increase from fiscal 2007 this growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores a 19 increase from the addition of the 53 rd week and domestic same store sales increase of 04 at august 30 2008 we operated 4092 domestic stores and 148 in mexico compared with 3933 domestic stores and 123 in mexico at august 25 2007 domestic retail sales increased 45 and domestic commercial sales increased 68 from prior year alldata and mexico sales increased over prior year contributing 12 percentage points of the total increase in net sales 

  19 

gross profit for fiscal 2008 was 3268 billion or 501 of net sales compared with 3064 billion or 497 of net sales for fiscal 2007 the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales was due to the positive impact of category management efforts partially offset by increased distribution expense relating to higher fuel costs 

vendor funding is primarily recorded as a reduction to inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold however vendor funding for specific selling activities is recorded as a reduction to operating selling general and administrative expenses historically we have classified the majority of our funding as a reduction to inventory however during the current year we began to transition to more specific promotions and selling activities as we increased our efforts with vendors to develop tactics to allow them to drive sales and showcase their product which affect selling general and administrative expenses 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 increased to 2144 billion or 329 of net sales from 2009 billion or 326 of net sales for fiscal 2007 the increase of operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher employee medical expense and fuel expense for our commercial fleet 

interest expense net for fiscal 2008 was 1167 million compared with 1191 million during fiscal 2007 this decrease was primarily due to lower shortterm rates and was offset by higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and the impact of the additional week in the current fiscal year average borrowings for fiscal 2008 were 2024 billion compared with 1972 billion for fiscal 2007 weighted average borrowing rates were 52 at august 30 2008 compared to 57 at august 25 2007 

our effective income tax rate was 363 of pretax income for fiscal 2008 compared to 364 for fiscal 2007 refer to “note d — income taxes” for additional information regarding our income tax rate 

net income for fiscal 2008 increased by 77 to 6416 million and diluted earnings per share increased 178 to 1004 from 853 in fiscal 2007 the impact of the fiscal 2008 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008 was an increase of approximately 029 excluding the additional week net income for the year increased 51 over the previous year to 6258 million while diluted earnings per share increased 149 to 980 per share 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 

for the year ended august 25 2007 autozone reported net sales of 6170 billion compared with 5948 billion for the year ended august 26 2006 a 37 increase from fiscal 2006 this growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores at august 25 2007 we operated 3933 domestic stores and 123 in mexico compared with 3771 domestic stores and 100 in mexico at august 26 2006 domestic retail sales increased 34 and domestic commercial sales decreased 04 from prior year alldata and mexico sales increased over prior year contributing 09 percentage points of the total increase in net sales domestic same store sales or sales for domestic stores open at least one year increased 01 from the prior year 

gross profit for fiscal 2007 was 3064 billion or 497 of net sales compared with 2939 billion or 494 of net sales for fiscal 2006 the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives and supply chain efficiencies 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 increased to 2009 billion or 326 of net sales from 1929 billion or 324 of net sales for fiscal 2006 the increase in expenses is driven primarily by higher occupancy cost versus the prior year 

interest expense net for fiscal 2007 was 1191 million compared with 1079 million during fiscal 2006 this increase was due to higher short term rates and higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and the recognition of interest expense on capital lease obligations that were accounted for as operating leases prior to a modification to the lease agreements in fiscal 2007 average borrowings for fiscal 2007 were 1972 billion compared with 1928 billion for fiscal 2006 weighted average borrowing rates were 57 at august 25 2007 compared to 55 at august 26 2006 

  20 

our effective income tax rate decreased to 364 of pretax income for fiscal 2007 as compared to 369 for fiscal 2006 primarily due to benefits from changes in our pretax earnings mix and an increase in certain federal and state tax credits refer to “note d — income taxes” for additional information regarding our income tax rate 

net income for fiscal 2007 increased 46 to 5957 million and diluted earnings per share increased 136 to 853 from 750 in fiscal 2006 the impact of the fiscal 2007 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 was an increase of approximately 014 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

autozone’s business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months of march through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december through february during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states and mexico 

each of the first three quarters of autozone’s fiscal year consisted of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks in 2008 and 16 weeks in 2007 and 2006 because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 containing 17 weeks represented 339 of annual sales and 380 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 containing 16 weeks represented 325 of annual sales and 365 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 containing 16 weeks represented 326 of annual sales and 375 of net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 9211 million in fiscal 2008 8452 million in fiscal 2007 and 8227 million in fiscal 2006 the increase over prior year was primarily due to the growth in net income and to a lesser extent timing of income tax deductions and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors continue to finance a large portion of our inventory partially offsetting this increase was higher accounts receivable we have maintained an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 95 at august 30 2008 93 at august 25 2007 and 92 at august 26 2006 

autozone’s primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program from the beginning of fiscal 2006 to august 30 2008 we have opened 567 net new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 2432 million in fiscal 2008 compared to 2287 million in fiscal 2007 and 2683 million in fiscal 2006 we invested 2436 million in capital assets in fiscal 2008 compared to 2245 million in capital assets in fiscal 2007 and 2636 million in capital assets in fiscal 2006 new store openings were 185 for fiscal 2008 186 for fiscal 2007 and 204 for fiscal 2006 we invest a portion of our assets held by the company’s wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we acquired 543 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2008 946 million in fiscal 2007 and 1600 million in fiscal 2006 we had proceeds from matured marketable securities of 507 million in fiscal 2008 869 million in fiscal 2007 and 1454 million in fiscal 2006 capital asset disposals provided 40 million in fiscal 2008 35 million in fiscal 2007 and 98 million in fiscal 2006 

net cash used in financing activities was 5227 million in fiscal 2008 6214 million in fiscal 2007 and 5377 million in fiscal 2006 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 8492 million for fiscal 2008 7619 million for fiscal 2007 and 5781 million for fiscal 2006 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations and at times by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt reflected 7500 million for fiscal 2008 none for fiscal 2007 and 2000 million for fiscal 2006 debt repayments totaled 2298 million for fiscal 2008 58 million for fiscal 2007 and 1527 million for fiscal 2006 as discussed in note f in august 2008 we issued 5000 million in 650 senior notes due 2014 and 2500 million in 7125 senior notes due 2018 a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of debt was used to repay outstanding commercial paper which had increased for the repayment of the 1900 million senior notes that matured in july we intend to use the remainder of the proceeds to redeem or repurchase existing debt for working capital needs for capital expenditures for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes net repayments of commercial paper were 2067 million for fiscal 2008 and 520 million for fiscal 2006 for fiscal 2007 net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were 843 million 

  21 

we expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2009 primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and systems in addition to the building and land costs our new store development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be impacted by a prolonged tightening of the credit markets which may directly limit our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

credit ratings 

at august 30 2008 autozone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and a commercial paper rating of a2 moody’s investors service had assigned the company a senior unsecured debt credit rating of baa2 and a commercial paper rating of p2 fitch ratings assigned the company a bbb rating for senior unsecured debt and an f2 rating for commercial paper as of august 30 2008 moody’s standard  poor’s and fitch had autozone listed as having a “stable” outlook if our credit ratings drop our interest expense may increase similarly we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will likely increase as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit if our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade our access to financing may become more limited 

debt facilities 

we maintain 10 billion of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the credit facilities may be increased to 13 billion at autozone’s election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 100 million in capital leases as the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit the company had 8797 million in available capacity under these facilities at august 30 2008 the rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of bank of america’s base rate or a eurodollar rate each as defined in the facility agreements or a combination thereof these facilities expire in may 2010 

our 3000 million bank term loan entered in december 2004 was amended in april 2006 to have similar terms and conditions as the 10 billion credit facilities but with a december 2009 maturity and was further amended in august 2007 to reduce the interest rate on eurodollar loans that credit agreement with a group of banks provides for a term loan which consists of at our election base rate loans eurodollar loans or a combination thereof the interest accrues on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 12 of 1 interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage which can range from 30 basis points to 90 basis points depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating based on our ratings at august 30 2008 the applicable percentage on eurodollar loans is 35 basis points we may select interest periods of one two three or six months for eurodollar loans subject to availability interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period but no less frequently than quarterly we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on december 29 2004 to effectively fix based on current debt ratings the interest rate of the term loan at 44 we have the option to extend loans into subsequent interest periods or convert them into loans of another interest rate type the entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan will be due and payable in full on december 23 2009 when the facility terminates we may prepay the term loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty subject to reimbursement of the lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of eurodollar borrowings

on june 25 2008 we entered into an agreement with esl investments inc setting forth certain understandings and agreements see exhibit 1032 for complete details regarding the voting by esl investments inc on behalf of itself and its affiliates collectively “esl” of certain shares of common stock of autozone inc and related matters among other things we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to increase our adjusted debtebitdar target ratio from 211 to 251 no later than february 14 2009 we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and options expenses to net income 

during july 2008 our 1900 million senior notes maturing at that time were repaid with an increase in commercial paper on august 4 2008 we issued 5000 million in 650 senior notes due 2014 and 2500 million in 7125 senior notes due 2018 under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july 29 2008 we used a portion of the proceeds to pay down our commercial paper and intend to use the remainder for general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions 

during april 2006 our 1500 million senior notes maturing at that time were repaid with an increase in commercial paper on june 8 2006 we issued 2000 million in 695 senior notes due 2016 under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 17 2004 that shelf registration allowed us to sell up to 300 million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions the remainder of the shelf registration was cancelled in february 2007 

the 650 and 7125 notes issued during august 2008 are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded and a provision where repayment of the notes may be accelerated if autozone experiences a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes arrangements contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our other borrowing arrangements covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs as of august 30 2008 we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants 

stock repurchases 

during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the program was amended in june 2008 to increase the repurchase authorization to 64 billion from 59 billion from january 1998 to august 30 2008 we have repurchased a total of 1061 million shares at an aggregate cost of 63 billion we repurchased 68 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 8492 million during fiscal 2008 60 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 7619 million during fiscal 2007 and 62 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 5781 million during fiscal 2006

financial commitments 

the following table shows autozone’s significant contractual obligations as of august 30 2008 

 

 we have other obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities or due to the nature of the account therefore the timing of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2009 that are included in current liabilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 30 2008 

 

a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet the standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

in conjunction with our commercial sales program we offer credit to some of our commercial customers the majority of our receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse autozone has recorded a reserve for this recourse at august 30 2008 the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of 554 million and the balance of the recourse reserve was 12 million

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the company’s comparative yeartoyear operating results furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board of directors use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

recent accounting pronouncements 

on august 26 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” this interpretation establishes new standards for the financial statement recognition measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns for additional information on the impact of adoption of fin 48 refer to “note d — income taxes” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

on august 25 2007 we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fasb statement no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans and the recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation “pbo” of the plan refer to “note i pension and savings plans” for further description of this adoption 

additionally sfas 158 requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsor’s year end we currently use a may 31 measurement date for our plans therefore this standard will require us to change our measurement date to our fiscal year end beginning in fiscal 2009 the impact from adopting the measurement provisions is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued fasb statement no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” this new standard defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2009 for financial assets and liabilities and at the beginning of fiscal 2010 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities the adoption of this statement is not expected to have an immediate material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued fasb statement no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” this new standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value sfas 159 will be effective for autozone in fiscal 2009 the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because we do not currently intend to elect to apply fair value to any financial instruments that are not already reported at fair value 

in december 2007 the fasb issued fasb statement 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” this standard significantly changes the accounting for and reporting of business combinations in consolidated financial statements among other things sfas 141r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date and requires the expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs the standard is effective for us beginning august 30 2009 fiscal 2010 and is applicable only to transactions occurring after the effective date 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements including an amendment for arb no 51” “sfas 160” sfas 160 amends arb no 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements sfas 160 is effective for us beginning august 30 2009 the adoption of sfas 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 133” “sfas 161” sfas 161 amends sfas no 133 to change the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 133 and its related interpretations and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas 161 is effective for autozone beginning in fiscal 2010 we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas 161 

  27 

in may 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 162 “the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” “sfas 162” sfas 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states sfas no 162 is effective 60 days after the sec’s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section 411 

critical accounting policies 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout “lifo” method included in inventory are related purchasing storage and handling costs due to price deflation on the company’s merchandise purchases the company’s inventory balances are effectively maintained under the firstin firstout method as the company’s policy is not to write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments resulting in cost of sales being reflected at the higher amount the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs additionally we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrinkage our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts 

vendor allowances 

autozone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements monies received from vendors include rebates allowances and promotional funds the amounts to be received are subject to purchase volumes and the terms of the vendor agreements which generally do not state an expiration date but are subject to ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on changes in market conditions vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sellthrough of the related merchandise 

rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product sales and are accrued ratably over the purchase or sale of the related product but only if it is reasonably certain that the required volume levels will be reached these monies are recorded as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 

allowances and promotional funds earned under vendor funding programs are accounted for pursuant to the emerging issues task force issue no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor” “eitf 0216” the majority of the vendor funds received is recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold for arrangements that provide for reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor’s products the vendor funds are recorded as a reduction to selling general and administrative expenses in the period in which the specific costs were incurred 

  28 

impairments 

in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of longlived assets such as property and equipment covered by this standard annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as part of the evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment we compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets 

under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” we perform an annual test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists we perform the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 

if impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment loss such evaluations require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation is performed which could differ from actual results 

selfinsurance 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation vehicle employee health general and product liability and property losses and we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported through various methods which include analyses of historical trends and utilization of actuaries the company estimates the costs of these risks the longterm portions of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value we believe the amounts accrued are adequate although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided 

income taxes 

we accrue and pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax matters in dispute with state federal and foreign tax authorities we measure and record income tax contingency accruals in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluations are based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law successfully settled issues under audit expirations due to statues and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual 

we classify interest related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense and if applicable penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense the income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities the remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date these noncurrent income tax liabilities are recorded in the caption “other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets 

litigation and other contingent liabilities 

we have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business such as employment matters product liability claims and general liability claims related to our store premises we calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 

  29 

pension obligation 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 the company’s supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances 

 

if such assumptions differ materially from actual experience the impact could be material to our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

autozone is exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations hedging costs and past changes in the associated foreign exchange rates no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our board of directors further we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

autozone’s financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

autozone has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets all of the company’s interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges we had an outstanding interest rate swap with a fair value of 43 million at august 30 2008 and 58 million at august 25 2007 to effectively fix the interest rate on the 3000 million term loan entered into during december 2004 

the related gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income the company’s hedge instrument was determined to be highly effective as of august 30 2008 

  30 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 2235 billion as of august 30 2008 and 1928 billion as of august 25 2007 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to autozone for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by 150 million at august 30 2008 and less than the carrying value of debt by 76 million at august 25 2007 considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge we had no variable rate debt outstanding at august 30 2008 and 2456 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 25 2007 in fiscal 2007 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of 25 million which includes the effects of the interest rate swap the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 2250 billion at august 30 2008 and 1690 billion at august 25 2007 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by 907 million at august 30 2008 and 608 million at august 25 2007 

fuel price risk 

fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas 133 and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel and unleaded fuel exposure we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during the 2008 or 2006 fiscal years during fiscal 2007 we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure these swaps were settled within a few days of the fiscal year end and had no significant impact on cost of sales for the 2007 fiscal year

 item 1 business 

introduction 

we are the nation’s leading specialty retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories with most of our sales to doityourself “diy” customers we began operations in 1979 and at august 25 2007 operated 3933 stores in the united states and puerto rico and 123 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products in many of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers and service stations we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software on the web at wwwautozonecom we sell diagnostic and repair information auto and light truck parts and accessories we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 

at august 25 2007 our stores were in the following locations 

 

marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service value and quality automotive parts and products at conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts and lifetime warranties are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts we sell our wide area network in our stores helps us to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to locate parts at neighboring autozone stores and in some cases to place special orders directly with our vendors 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool® program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a diy customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings battery charging oil recycling and testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators 

merchandising 

the following table shows some of the types of products that we sell 

 

 

 

 

we believe that the satisfaction of diy customers and professional technicians is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested our stores generally offer approximately 21000 stock keeping units “skus” covering a broad range of vehicle types each store carries the same basic product lines but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or local satellite stores in excess of 750000 additional skus of slowerselling products are available either through our vendor direct program “vdp” which offers overnight delivery or through our salvage auto parts and original equipment manufacturer “oem” parts programs 

we are constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our inventory matches the products that our customers demand 

pricing 

 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a good warranty and outstanding customer service on many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key component is our exclusive line of inhouse brands valucraft autozone duralast and duralast gold we believe that our overall prices and value compare favorably to those of our competitors 

marketing advertising and promotions 

 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions and advertising primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and targeted loyalty efforts are our primary marketing methods of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage and creative product placement to help educate customers about products they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

 

we design and build stores for a high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors maintenance products accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and on the shelf 

commercial 

our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and is one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers and service stations in the united states as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to our commercial customers the program operated out of 2182 stores as of august 25 2007 through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians and this additional inventory is available for our diy customers as well we have a national sales team focused on national and regional commercial accounts 

store operations 

store formats 

 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

 

 

store personnel and training 

 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager autozoners typically have prior automotive experience all autozoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry although we do onthejob training we also provide formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from both the company and from independent certification agencies training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

 

all of our stores have znet tm  our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts our customers need and provides complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet tm provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet tm display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both autozoners and customers can view the screen in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access immediately national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

store development 

the following table reflects store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

the domestic stores include stores in the united states and puerto rico the new store count in 2007 reflects 3 stores that were temporarily closed during fiscal 2006 and excluded from the prior year ending store count we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older “our kind of vehicles” as these are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and will require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico no one class of product accounts for as much as 10 percent of our total sales in fiscal 2007 no single supplier accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases we generally have few longterm contracts for the purchase of merchandise we believe that we have good relationships with suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores a hub store is able to provide replenishment of products sold and deliver other products maintained only in hub store inventories to a store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in both the retail “diy” and commercial doitforme “difm” auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise selection and availability price product warranty store layouts and location 

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “valucraft” “alldata” and “znet tm ” we believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our merchandising and marketing strategy 

employees 

as of august 25 2007 we employed approximately 55000 persons approximately 56 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 93 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 5 percent in distribution centers and approximately 2 percent in store support functions included in the above numbers are approximately 2000 persons employed in our mexico operations 

we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our autozoners are generally good 

 

autozone website 

autozone’s primary website is at httpwwwautozonecom we make available free of charge at our investor relations website httpwwwautozoneinccom our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably feasible after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face and that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

we may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates   

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 3107 stores at august 31 2002 to 4056 stores at august 25 2007 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 5326 billion in fiscal 2002 to 6170 billion in fiscal 2007 an average increase per year of 3 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and samestore sales we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores or increase samestore sales 

our business depends upon qualified employees   

at the end of fiscal 2007 our consolidated employee count was approximately 55000 we cannot assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected   

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors in the short term it may depend upon 

 

 

 

 

for the long term demand for our products may depend upon 

 

 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the   products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may   decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are rapidly opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a supplier in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts   business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty and distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories we can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers 

 

if our vendors continue to consolidate we may pay higher prices for our   merchandise 

in recent years several of our vendors have merged further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business   

if our competitors consolidate with other auto parts chains and are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are stronger 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact   availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 

rising energy prices may negatively impact our profitability 

as mentioned above rising energy prices may impact demand for the products that we sell overall transaction count and our profitability higher energy prices impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs 

demand for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make available the information our customers need to work on their own vehicles 

demand for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make available to the automotive aftermarket industry diagnostic repair and maintenance information that our customers both retail “diy” and commercial “difm” require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles without public dissemination of this information consumers may be forced to have all diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer network

on june 22 2005 the attorney general of the state of california in conjunction with district attorneys for san bernardino san joaquin and monterey counties filed suit in the san bernardino county superior court against autozone inc and its california subsidiaries the san diego county district attorney later joined the suit the lawsuit alleges that autozone failed to follow various state statutes and regulation governing the storage and handling of used motor oil and other materials collected for recycling or used for cleaning autozone stores and parking lots the suit sought 12 million in penalties and injunctive relief on june 1 2007 autozone and the state entered into a stipulated final judgment by consent the stipulated final judgment amended the suit to also allege weights and measures pricing violations pursuant to this judgment autozone is enjoined from committing these types of violations and agreed to pay civil penalties in the amount of 18 million including 15 million in cash and a 300000 credit for work performed to insure compliance 

autozone is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business although the amount of liability that may result from these other proceedings cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

results of operations 

fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 

for the year ended august 25 2007 autozone reported net sales of 6170 billion compared with 5948 billion for the year ended august 26 2006 a 37 increase from fiscal 2006 this growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores at august 25 2007 we operated 3933 domestic stores and 123 in mexico compared with 3771 domestic stores and 100 in mexico at august 26 2006 domestic retail sales increased 34 and domestic commercial sales decreased 04 from prior year alldata and mexico sales increased over prior year contributing 09 percentage points of the total increase in net sales domestic same store sales or sales for domestic stores open at least one year increased 01 from the prior year 

gross profit for fiscal 2007 was 3064 billion or 497 of net sales compared with 2939 billion or 494 of net sales for fiscal 2006 the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives and supply chain efficiencies 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 increased to 2009 billion or 326 of net sales from 1929 billion or 324 of net sales for fiscal 2006 the increase in expenses is driven primarily by higher occupancy cost versus the prior year 

interest expense net for fiscal 2007 was 1191 million compared with 1079 million during fiscal 2006 this increase was primarily due to higher short term rates and higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and the recognition of interest expense on capital lease obligations that were accounted for as operating leases prior to a modification to the lease agreements in fiscal 2007 average borrowings for fiscal 2007 were 1972 billion compared with 1928 billion for fiscal 2006 weighted average borrowing rates were 57 at august 25 2007 compared to 55 at august 26 2006 

our effective income tax rate decreased to 364 of pretax income for fiscal 2007 as compared to 369 for fiscal 2006   primarily due to benefits from changes in our pretax earnings mix and an increase in certain federal and state tax credits   refer to note d  income taxes for additional information regarding our income tax rate 

net income for fiscal 2007 increased by 46 to 5957 million and diluted earnings per share increased by 136 to 853 from 750 in fiscal 2006 the impact of the fiscal 2007 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 was an increase of approximately 014 

fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 

for the year ended august 26 2006 autozone reported sales of 5948 billion compared with 5711 billion for the year ended august 27 2005 a 42 increase from fiscal 2005 this growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores at august 26 2006 we operated 3771 domestic stores and 100 in mexico compared with 3592 domestic stores and 81 in mexico at august 27 2005 domestic retail sales increased 40 and domestic commercial sales decreased 13 from prior year alldata and mexico sales increased over prior year contributing 09 percentage points of the total increase same store sales or sales for domestic stores open at least one year increased 04 from the prior year 

gross profit for fiscal 2006 was 2939 billion or 494 of net sales compared with 2793 billion or 489 of net sales for fiscal 2005 the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives partially offset by increases in certain commodity costs our ongoing category management initiatives have included continued optimization of merchandise assortment and pricing management of procurement costs and an increasing focus on direct importing initiatives 

operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 increased to 1929 billion or 324 of net sales from 1817 billion or 318 of net sales for fiscal 2005 expenses for fiscal 2005 include a 403 million charge related to accounting for leases see “note j  leases” expenses for fiscal 2006 include 174 million in sharebased compensation expense resulting from the current year adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” see “note b  sharebased payments” the remaining increase in expenses is driven by initiatives to improve the customer’s shopping experience and higher occupancy costs driven largely by the opening of new stores these initiatives continue to include expanded hours of operation enhanced training programs and ensuring clean wellmerchandised stores 

interest expense net for fiscal 2006 was 1079 million compared with 1024 million during fiscal 2005 this increase was due to a higher average borrowing rate partially offset by lower average borrowing levels average borrowings for fiscal 2006 were 1928 billion compared with 1970 billion for fiscal 2005 weighted average borrowing rates were 55 at august 26 2006 compared to 52 at august 27 2005 the increase in interest rates reflects both the ongoing effort to extend the terms of our borrowings as well as the impact from increased shortterm rates 

our effective income tax rate increased to 369 of pretax income for fiscal 2006 as compared to 346 for fiscal 2005  the fiscal 2005 effective income tax rate reflects 213 million in tax benefits related to the repatriation of mexican earnings as a result of the american jobs creation act of 2004 see “note d  income taxes” and other discrete income tax items 

net income for fiscal 2006 decreased by 03 to 5693 million and diluted earnings per share increased by 45 to 750 from 718 in fiscal 2005 the impact of the fiscal 2006 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006 was an increase of approximately 009 

 

seasonality and quarterly periods 

autozone’s business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months of march through august in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december through february during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states and mexico 

each of the first three quarters of autozone’s fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 represented 325 of annual sales and 365 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 represented 326 of annual sales and 375 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 represented 330 of annual sales and 362 of net income 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities was 8452 million in fiscal 2007 8227 million in fiscal 2006 and 6481 million in fiscal 2005 the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories our new store development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories during the past three fiscal years we have maintained an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 93 at august 25 2007 92 at august 26 2006 and 93 at august 27 2005 the increase in merchandise inventories required to support new store development and sales growth has largely been financed by our vendors as evidenced by our accounts payable to inventory ratio contributing to this ratio is the use of payonscan “pos” arrangements with certain vendors under a pos arrangement autozone will not purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until that merchandise is ultimately sold to autozone’s customers upon the sale of the merchandise to autozone’s customers autozone recognizes the liability for the goods and pays the vendor in accordance with the agreedupon terms revenues under pos arrangements are included in net sales in the income statement since we do not own merchandise under pos arrangements until just before it is sold to a customer such merchandise is not included in our balance sheet merchandise under pos arrangements was 224 million at august 25 2007 

autozone’s primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program from the beginning of fiscal 2005 to august 25 2007 we have opened 573 net new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 2287 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 2683 million in fiscal 2006 and 2828 million in fiscal 2005 we invested 2245 million in capital assets in fiscal 2007 compared to 2636 million in capital assets in fiscal 2006 and 2835 million in fiscal 2005 new store openings were 186 for fiscal 2007 204 for fiscal 2006 and 193 for fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2006 we began investing a portion of our assets held by the company’s wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we acquired 946 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2007 and acquired 1600 million in fiscal 2006 we had proceeds from matured marketable securities of 869 million in fiscal 2007 and 1454 million in fiscal 2006 capital asset disposals provided 35 million in fiscal 2007 98 million in fiscal 2006 and 38 million for fiscal 2005 

net cash used in financing activities was 6214 million in fiscal 2007 5377 million in fiscal 2006 and 3674 million in fiscal 2005 the net cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock which totaled 7619 million for fiscal 2007 5781 million for fiscal 2006 and 4269 million for fiscal 2005 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 were primarily funded by cash flow from operations and at times by increases in debt levels 

we expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal 2008 primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and systems in addition to the building and land costs our new store development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required we believe that we will be able to continue to finance much of our inventory requirements through favorable payment terms from suppliers 

depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 

credit ratings 

 

at august 25 2007 autozone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and a commercial paper rating of a2 moody’s investors service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of baa2 and a commercial paper rating of p2 as of august 25 2007 moody’s and standard  poor’s had autozone listed as having a “stable” outlook if our credit ratings drop our interest expense may increase similarly we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will increase as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit if our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade our access to financing may become more limited 

 

debt facilities 

 

we maintain 10 billion of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans these facilities expire in may 2010 may be increased to 13 billion at autozone’s election may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 100 million in capital leases as the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit the company had 6802 million in available capacity under these facilities at august 25 2007 the rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of bank of america’s base rate or a eurodollar rate each as defined in the facility agreements or a combination thereof 

our 3000 million bank term loan entered in december 2004 was amended in april 2006 to have similar terms and conditions as the 10 billion credit facilities but with a december 2009 maturity and was further amended in august 2007 to reduce the interest rate on eurodollar loans that credit agreement with a group of banks provides for a term loan which consists of at our election base rate loans eurodollar loans or a combination thereof the interest accrues on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 12 of 1 interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage which can range from 30 basis points to 90 basis points depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating based on our ratings at august 25 2007 the applicable percentage on eurodollar loans is 35 basis points we may select interest periods of one two three or six months for eurodollar loans subject to availability interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period but no less frequently than quarterly we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on december 29 2004 to effectively fix based on current debt ratings the interest rate of the term loan at 44 we have the option to extend loans into subsequent interest periods or convert them into loans of another interest rate type the entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan will be due and payable in full on december 23 2009 when the facility terminates we may prepay the term loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty subject to reimbursement of the lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of eurodollar borrowings 

during april 2006 our 1500 million senior notes maturing at that time were repaid with an increase in commercial paper on june 8 2006 we issued 2000 million in 695 senior notes due 2016 under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on august 17 2004 that shelf registration allowed us to sell up to 300 million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions the remainder of the shelf registration was cancelled in february 2007 

our borrowings under our senior notes arrangements contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our other borrowing arrangements covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a provision where repayment obligations may be accelerated if autozone experiences a change in control as defined in the agreements all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs as of august 25 2007 we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants 

stock repurchases 

 

during 1998 the company announced a program permitting the company to repurchase a portion of its outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by the company’s board of directors the program was most recently amended in june 2007 to increase the repurchase authorization to 59 billion from 54 billion from january 1998 to august 25 2007 the company has repurchased a total of 993 million shares at an aggregate cost of 54 billion the company repurchased 60 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 7619 million during fiscal 2007 62 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 5781 million during fiscal 2006 and 48 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of 4269 million during fiscal 2005 

 

financial commitments 

 

the following table shows autozone’s significant contractual obligations as of august 25 2007  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have other obligations reflected in our balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities or due to the nature of the account therefore the timing of these payments cannot be determined except for amounts estimated to be payable in 2008 that are included in current liabilities 

we have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states these contingent liabilities are not included in the table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 25 2007 

 

 

a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet the standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses 

in conjunction with our commercial sales program we offer credit to some of our commercial customers the majority of our receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse autozone has recorded a reserve for this recourse at august 25 2007 the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of 553 million and the balance of the recourse reserve was 18 million 

 

we have entered into pos arrangements with certain vendors whereby we will not purchase merchandise supplied by a vendor until just before that merchandise is ultimately sold to our customers title and certain risks of ownership remain with the vendor until the merchandise is sold to our customers since we do not own merchandise under pos arrangements until just before it is sold to a customer such merchandise is not recorded on our balance sheet upon the sale of the merchandise to our customers we recognize the liability for the goods and pay the vendor in accordance with the agreedupon terms although we do not hold title to the goods we do control pricing and have credit collection risk and therefore gross revenues under pos arrangements are included in net sales in the income statement sales of merchandise under pos arrangements approximated 1700 million in fiscal 2007 3900 million in fiscal 2006 and 4600 million in fiscal 2005 merchandise under pos arrangements was 224 million at august 25 2007 and 921 million at august 26 2006

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 

“selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” these nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value 

nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information to analyze or compare our operations furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board of directors use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performancebased compensation we have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable gaap measures in the following reconciliation tables

critical accounting policies 

preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board of directors the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment 

inventory and cost of sales 

 

we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout “lifo” method included in inventory are related purchasing storage and handling costs due to price deflation on the company’s merchandise purchases the company’s inventory balances are effectively maintained under the firstin firstout method as the company’s policy is not to write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments resulting in cost of sales being reflected at the higher amount since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs additionally we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrinkage our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts

autozone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors based on the volume of purchases or for services that autozone provides to the vendors monies received from vendors include rebates allowances and promotional funds the amounts to be received are subject to purchase volumes and the terms of the vendor agreements which generally do not state an expiration date but are subject to ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on changes in market conditions vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sellthrough of the related merchandise the company’s level of advertising and other operating selling general and administrative expenditures are not dependent on vendor allowances 

rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product sales and are accrued ratably over the purchase or sale of the related product but only if it is reasonably certain that the required volume levels will be reached these monies are recorded as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 

for all allowances and promotional funds earned under vendor funding the company applies the guidance pursuant to the emerging issues task force issue no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor” “eitf 0216” by recording the vendor funds as a reduction of inventories that are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold the company’s vendor funding arrangements do not provide for any reimbursement arrangements that are for specific incremental identifiable costs that are permitted under eitf 0216 for the funding to be recorded as a reduction to advertising or other operating selling general and administrative expenses 

impairments 

 

in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of longlived assets such as property and equipment covered by this standard annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as part of the evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment we compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets 

under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” we perform an annual test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists we perform the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 

if impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment loss such evaluations require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation is performed which could differ from actual results 

selfinsurance 

 

we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation vehicle employee health general and product liability and property losses liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported through various methods which include analyses of historical trends and utilization of actuaries the company estimates the costs of these risks the actuarial estimated longterm portions of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liabilities are not discounted we believe the amounts accrued are adequate although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided we maintain stoploss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks 

income taxes 

 

we accrue and pay income taxes based on the tax statutes regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax matters in dispute with state federal and foreign tax authorities management believes the resolution of the current open tax issues will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

litigation and other contingent liabilities 

 

we have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business such as employment matters product liability claims and general liability claims related to our store premises we calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 

pension obligation 

 

prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 the company’s supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by actuarial calculations using two key assumptions 

i expected longterm rate of return on plan assets estimated by considering the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions 

 

ii discount rate used to determine benefit obligations adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date may 31 using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year if such assumptions differ materially from actual experience the impact could be material to our financial statements 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

autozone is exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations hedging costs and past changes in the associated foreign exchange rates no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our board of directors further we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

 

autozone’s financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

autozone has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets all of the company’s interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges we had an outstanding interest rate swap with a fair value of 58 million at august 25 2007 and 102 million at august 26 2006 to effectively fix the interest rate on the 3000 million term loan entered into during december 2004 

the related gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income the company’s hedge instrument was determined to be highly effective as of august 25 2007 

 

the fair value of our debt was estimated at 1928 billion as of august 25 2007 and 1825 billion as of august 26 2006 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to autozone for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by 76 million at august 25 2007 and less than the carrying value of debt by 323 million at august 26 2006 considering the effect of any interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges we had 2456 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 25 2007 and 1672 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 26 2006 at these borrowing levels for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of 25 million in 2007 and 17 million in 2006 which includes the effects of interest rate swaps the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor considering the effect of any interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 1690 billion at august 25 2007 and at august 26 2006 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by 608 million at august 25 2007 and 683 million at august 26 2006 

fuel price risk 

 

fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas 133 and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel and unleaded fuel exposure as of august 25 2007 the then current month’s fuel swap contract was outstanding with a settlement date of august 31 2007 during fiscal 2007 and 2005 we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure these swaps were settled within a few days of each fiscal year end and had no significant impact on cost of sales for the 2007 or 2005 fiscal years we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2006

 item 1 business 

introduction 

we are the nation’s leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories with most of our sales to doityourself “diy” customers we began operations in 1979 and at august 26 2006 operated 3771 stores in the united states and 100 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products in many of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers and service stations we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software on the web at wwwautozonecom we sell diagnostic and repair information auto and light truck parts and accessories we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation 

at august 26 2006 our stores were in the following locations 

 

 

 

marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service value and quality automotive parts and products at conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer marketing research we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts and lifetime warranties are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts we sell our wide area network in our stores helps us to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to locate parts at neighboring autozone stores and in some cases to place orders directly with our vendors 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool® program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a diy customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings battery charging oil recycling and testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators 

merchandising 

the following table shows some of the types of products that we sell 

 

 

 

 

we believe that the satisfaction of diy customers and professional technicians is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested our stores generally offer approximately 21000 stock keeping units “skus” covering a broad range of vehicle types each store carries the same basic product lines but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or local satellite stores in excess of 750000 additional skus of slowerselling products are available either through our vendor direct program “vdp” which offers overnight delivery or through our salvage auto parts and original equipment manufacturer “oem” parts programs 

we are constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our inventory matches the products that our customers demand 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a good warranty and outstanding customer service on many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key component is our exclusive line of inhouse brands valucraft autozone duralast and duralast gold we believe that our overall prices and value compare favorably to those of our competitors 

marketing advertising and promotions 

we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions and advertising primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and targeted loyalty efforts are our primary marketing methods of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage and creative product placement to help educate customers about products they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for a high visual impact the typical autozone store has an industrial “high tech” appearance by utilizing colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors maintenance products accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and on the shelf 

commercial 

our commercial sales program is one of the largest aftermarket sellers of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers and service stations in the united states as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to our commercial customers the program operated out of 2134 stores as of august 26 2006 through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians and this additional inventory is available for our diy customers as well commercial has a national sales team focused on national and regional commercial accounts as well as an outside sales force for customers located around our commercial stores 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

 

we have knowledgeable autozoners available to assist customers with their parts needs utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a display screen that is visible to both the autozoner and the customer in addition to helping ensure fast accurate parts lookup in both english and spanish the parts catalog will also suggest additional items that a customer should purchase to properly install the merchandise being purchased 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager autozoners typically have prior automotive experience all autozoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry although we do onthejob training we also provide formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that trains autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from both the company and from independent certification agencies training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have a proprietary electronic parts catalog that provides parts information based on the make model and year of a vehicle the electronic catalog also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the catalog display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both autozoners and customers can view the screen in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access immediately national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

 

store development 

the following table reflects store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

the fiscal 2006 closed store count reflects 4 stores that remain closed temporarily from hurricane damage we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older “our kind of vehicles” as these are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and will require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our two store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico no one class of product accounts for as much as 10 percent of our total sales in fiscal 2006 no single supplier accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases we generally have few longterm contracts for the purchase of merchandise we believe that we have good relationships with suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores a hub store is able to provide replenishment of products sold and deliver other products maintained only in hub store inventories to a store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in both the retail diy and commercial do it for me “difm” auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise selection and availability price product warranty store layouts and location 

 

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “valucraft” and “alldata” we believe that the “autozone” service marks and trademarks are important components of our merchandising and marketing strategy 

employees 

as of august 26 2006 we employed approximately 53000 persons approximately 57 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 91 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 6 percent in distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support functions included in the above numbers are approximately 1600 persons employed in our mexico operations 

we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our autozoners are generally good 

autozone website 

autozone’s primary website is at httpwwwautozonecom we make available free of charge at our investor relations website httpwwwautozoneinccom our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably feasible after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face and that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business 

we may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates   

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 3040 stores at august 25 2001 to 3871 stores at august 26 2006 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 4818 billion in fiscal 2001 to 5948 billion in fiscal 2006 an average increase per year of 5 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and samestore sales we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores or increase samestore sales 

 

our business depends upon qualified employees   

at the end of fiscal 2006 our consolidated employee count was approximately 53000 we cannot assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected   

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors in the short term it may depend upon 

 

 

 

 

for the long term demand for our products may depend upon 

 

 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the   products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may   decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are rapidly opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a supplier in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts   business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty and distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories we can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers 

if our vendors continue to consolidate we may pay higher prices for our   merchandise 

in recent years several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business   

in recent years several large auto parts chains have merged we do not know the impact these mergers will have upon competition in the automotive aftermarket if our competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are stronger 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact   availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 

rising energy prices may negatively impact our profitability 

as mentioned above rising energy prices may impact demand for the products that we sell overall transaction count and our profitability energy prices impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs 

demand for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make available the information our customers need to work on their own vehicles 

demand for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make available to the automotive aftermarket industry diagnostic repair and maintenance information our customers both retail diy and commercial difm require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles without public dissemination of this information consumers may be forced to have all diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer network

 item 1 business 

introduction 

we are the nation’s leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories with most of our sales to doityourself “diy” customers we began operations in 1979 and at august 27 2005 operated 3592 stores in the united states including 2 in puerto rico and 81 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products in many of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers and service stations we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software on the web at wwwautozonecom we sell diagnostic and repair information auto and light truck parts and accessories we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation 

at august 27 2005 our stores were in the following locations 

 

 

 

marketing and merchandising strategy 

we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service value and quality automotive parts and products at conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are 

customer service 

customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy which is based upon consumer input we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts and lifetime warranties are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts we sell our wide area network in our stores helps us to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes and to locate parts at neighboring autozone stores 

our stores generally open at 730 or 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 9 pm on sunday however some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 am until midnight seven days a week 

we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a diy customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings battery charging oil recycling and testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators 

merchandising 

the following table shows some of the types of products that we sell 

 

 

we believe that the satisfaction of diy customers and professional technicians is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested our stores generally offer approximately 21000 stock keeping units “skus” covering a broad range of vehicle types each store carries the same basic product line but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or local satellite stores in excess of 750000 additional skus of slowerselling products are available either through our vendor direct program “vdp” which offers overnight delivery or through our salvage auto parts and original equipment manufacturer “oem” parts programs 

we are constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our inventory matches the products that our customers want when they want them 

 

pricing 

we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a good warranty and outstanding customer service on many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products a key component is our exclusive line of inhouse brands valucraft autozone duralast and duralast gold we believe that our overall prices compare favorably to those of our competitors 

marketing 

we believe that targeted advertising and marketing play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize marketing and advertising primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and targeted loyalty efforts are our primary marketing methods of driving traffic to our stores to increase average sales dollars per transaction we utilize instore signage and creative product placement to help educate customers about products they need 

store design and visual merchandising 

we design and build stores for a high visual impact the typical autozone store has an industrial “high tech” appearance by utilizing colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors maintenance products accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and on the shelf 

commercial 

we believe our commercial sales program is one of the largest aftermarket seller of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers and service stations in the united states as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to our commercial customers the program operated out of 2104 stores as of august 27 2005 through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians and this additional inventory is available for our diy customers as well commercial has a national sales team focused on national and regional commercial accounts as well as an outside sales force for customers located around our commercial stores 

store operations 

store formats 

substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by a counter or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items 

 

we have knowledgeable autozoners available to assist customers with their parts needs utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a display screen that is visible to both the autozoner and the customer in addition to helping ensure fast accurate parts lookup in english or spanish the parts catalog will suggest additional items that a customer should purchase in order to properly install the merchandise being purchased 

we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 

store personnel and training 

each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager autozoners typically have prior automotive experience all autozoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence “ase” which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry although we do onthejob training we also provide formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that trains autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from both the company and from independent certification agencies training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 

store managers receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain quality autozoners 

all store support functions are centralized in our two store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales 

store automation 

all of our stores have a proprietary electronic parts catalog that provides parts information based on the make model and year of a vehicle the electronic catalog also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the catalog display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both autozoners and customers can view the screen in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes immediately access national warranty data implement realtime inventory controls and locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores 

our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

 

store development 

the following table reflects store development during the past five fiscal years 

 

we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve and in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older “our kind of vehicles” as these are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranty and will require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain 

merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our two store support centers located in memphis tennessee and mexico no one class of product accounts for as much as 10 percent of our total sales in fiscal 2005 no single supplier accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases we generally have few longterm contracts for the purchase of merchandise we believe that we have good relationships with suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores 

our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores a hub store is able to provide replenishment of products sold and deliver other products only maintained in hub store inventories to a store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in both the retail diy and commercial do it for me “difm” auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise selection and availability price product warranty store layouts and location 

 

trademarks and patents 

we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in certain other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “valucraft” and “alldata” we believe that the “autozone” service marks and trademarks are important components of our merchandising and marketing strategy 

employees 

as of august 27 2005 we employed approximately 52000 persons approximately 57 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 91 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 6 percent in distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support functions included in the above numbers are approximately 1300 persons employed in our mexico operations 

we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our autozoners are generally good 

autozone website 

autozone’s primary website is at httpwwwautozonecom we make available free of charge at our investor relations website httpwwwautozoneinccom our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended as soon as reasonably feasible after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission

risk factors 

we may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates   

we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 2928 stores at august 26 2000 to 3673 stores at august 27 2005 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 45 billion in fiscal 2000 to 57 billion in fiscal 2005 an average increase per year of 5 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and samestore sales same store sales were negative in fiscal 2005 we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores or increase samestore sales 

our business depends upon qualified employees   

at the end of fiscal 2005 our consolidated employee count was approximately 52000 we can not assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 

 

if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected   

demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors in the short term it may depend upon 

 

 

 

 

for the long term demand for our products may depend upon 

 

 

if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the   products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may   decline 

the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are rapidly opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a supplier in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets 

competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 

if we cannot profitably increase share in the commercial auto parts   business our sales growth may be limited 

although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket jobbers in addition to other auto parts retailers that have entered the commercial business although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty and distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have larger available inventories we can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers 

 

 

if our vendors continue to consolidate we may pay higher prices for our   merchandise 

in recent years several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products 

consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business   

in recent years several large auto parts chains have merged we do not know the impact these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive aftermarket if our competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are stronger 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact   availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales 

war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 

in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 

rising fuel prices may negatively impact our profitability 

as mentioned above rising fuel prices may demand for the products that we sell overall transaction count and our profitability fuel prices impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs 










 item 2 properties 

the following table reflects the square footage and number of leased and owned properties for our stores as of august 27 2005 

 

we have over 37 million square feet in distribution centers servicing our stores most of which is owned except for approximately 10 million square feet that is leased our distribution centers are located in arizona california georgia illinois louisiana ohio tennessee texas and mexico during fiscal 2005 we opened a new distribution center near dallas texas and closed our smaller facility in san antonio texas our store support center which we own is located in memphis tennessee and consists of 260000 square feet we also own and lease other properties that are not material in the aggregate

on june 22 2005 the attorney general of the state of california in conjunction with district attorneys for san bernardino san joaquin and monterey counties filed suit in the san bernardino county superior court against autozone inc and its california subsidiaries the san diego county district attorney later joined the suit the lawsuit alleges that autozone failed to follow various state statutes and regulations governing the storage and handling of used motor oil and other materials collected for recycling or used for cleaning autozone stores and parking lots the suit seeks 120 million in penalties and injunctive relief 

autozone is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business although the amount of liability that may result from these other proceedings cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 1 business 

introduction we are the nation’s leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories with most of our sales to doityourself “diy” customers we began operations in 1979 and at august 28 2004 operated 3420 auto parts stores in the united states and 63 in mexico each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products in many of our domestic stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers and service stations we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software on the web at wwwautozonecom we sell diagnostic and repair information auto and light truck parts and accessories we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation at august 28 2004 our stores were in the following locations  

 

marketing and merchandising strategy we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service value and quality automotive parts and products at conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are   customer service we believe that our customers value service therefore customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first by providing prompt courteous service and trustworthy advice our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts and lifetime warranties are offered by us or our vendors on many of the parts we sell our satellite system in our auto parts stores helps us expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes and locate parts at neighboring autozone stores our stores generally open at 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 8 pm on sunday some stores are open 24 hours and some have extended hours of 6 am or 7 am until midnight seven days a week we also provide specialty tools through our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller for which a diy customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job autozoners also provide other free services including check engine light readings battery charging and installation assistance oil recycling and testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators   merchandising the following table shows some of the types of products that we sell  

we believe that the satisfaction of diy customers and professional technicians is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested our stores generally offer between 21000 and 23000 stock keeping units “skus” covering a broad range of vehicle types each store carries the same basic product line but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models of the automobiles in each store’s trade area our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or local satellite stores slowerselling products are generally available through our vendor direct program vdp which offers overnight delivery we are constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our inventory matches the products that our customers want when they want them   pricing we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at a good price backed by a good warranty and outstanding customer service on many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products we believe that our overall prices compare favorably to those of our competitors   marketing we believe that targeted advertising and marketing play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment we are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize marketing and advertising primarily to educate customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance we also seek to convey the message that autozone is the brand known for “relentlessly creating the most exciting zone for vehicle solutions” broadcast and print media are designed primarily to increase store traffic instore signage and creative product placement help to educate customers about products they need as a means to increase average sales dollars per transaction   store design and visual merchandising we design and build stores for a high visual impact the typical autozone store has an industrial “high tech” appearance by utilizing colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors maintenance products accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products in floor displays end caps and on the shelf store managers are able to customize certain areas of the store to prominently display products that are in demand in the local community 

commercial we believe our commercial sales program is the third largest aftermarket seller of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers and service stations in the united states as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to some of our commercial customers the program operated out of 2209 stores as of august 28 2004 through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians and can also be used as additional available inventory for local stores in addition some of our commercial customers receive shipments directly from our distribution centers commercial has a national sales team focused on national and regional commercial accounts as well as an outside sales force for customers located around our commercial stores 

store operations   store formats substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is 7 

generally fronted by a counter or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items we have knowledgeable autozoners available to assist customers with their parts needs utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a display screen that is visible to both the autozoner and the customer in addition to helping ensure fast accurate parts lookup in english or spanish the parts catalog will suggest additional items that a customer should purchase in order to properly install the merchandise being purchased we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking   store personnel and training each auto parts store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager autozoners typically have prior automotive experience all autozoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry although we do onthejob training we also provide formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that trains autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from both the company and from independent certification agencies training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management store managers receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain quality autozoners all domestic store support functions are centralized in our store support center in memphis tennessee we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales   store automation all of our stores have a proprietary electronic parts catalog that provides parts information based on the make model and year of an automobile the electronic catalog also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the catalog display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both autozoners and customers can view the screen in addition our satellite system enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes immediately access national warranty data implement realtime inventory controls and locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores our domestic auto parts stores utilize our computerized store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 8 

store development the following table reflects store development during the past five fiscal years  

we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve and in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older “our kind of vehicles” okvs as these are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranty and will require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions 

purchasing and supply chain merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support center in memphis tennessee no one class of product accounts for as much as 10 percent of our total sales in fiscal 2004 no single supplier accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases we generally have few longterm contracts for the purchase of merchandise we believe that we have good relationships with suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to each store a hub store is able to provide replenishment of sold products and deliver special order products to a store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week 

competition the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in both the retail diy and commercial do it for me “difm” auto parts and accessories markets competitors include national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the trustworthy advice of our autozoners merchandise selection and availability price product warranty store layouts and location 9 

trademarks and patents we have registered several service marks and trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office as well as in other countries including our service marks “autozone” and “get in the zone” and trademarks “autozone” “duralast” “duralast gold” “valucraft” and “alldata” we believe that the “autozone” service marks and trademarks are important components of our merchandising and marketing strategy 

employees as of august 28 2004 we employed approximately 49000 persons approximately 59 percent of whom were employed fulltime about 91 percent of our autozoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 7 percent in distribution centers and approximately 2 percent in store support functions included in the above numbers are approximately 800 persons employed in our mexico operations we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our autozoners are generally good

store operations   store formats as of august 30 2003 we had domestic auto parts stores in the following square footage ranges  substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each store’s square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by a counter or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of accessories and maintenance items we have knowledgeable autozoners available to assist customers with their parts needs utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a display screen that is visible to both the autozoner and the customer in addition to helping ensure fast accurate parts lookup the parts catalog will suggest additional items that a customer should purchase in order to properly install the merchandise being purchased we believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking approximately 2600 of our auto parts stores are freestanding with the balance principally located within strip shopping centers freestanding large format stores typically have parking for approximately 40 to 45 cars on a lot of approximately 34 to one acre our smaller stores typically have parking for approximately 20 to 30 cars and are usually located on a lot of approximately 12 to 34 acre   store personnel and training each auto parts store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager autozoners typically have prior automotive experience all autozoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry although we do onthejob training we also provide formal training programs including regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that trains autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from both the company and from independent certification agencies training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management 9 store managers receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain quality autozoners our domestic auto parts stores are primarily supervised through district managers who oversee approximately 10 to 12 stores each and who report to regional managers regional managers with approximately 80 to 90 stores each in turn report to five vice presidents of operations all store support functions are centralized in our store support center in memphis tennessee we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales   store automation all of our stores have a proprietary electronic parts catalog that provides parts information based on the make model and year of an automobile the catalog display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both autozoners and customers can view the screen in addition our satellite system enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes immediately access national warranty data implement realtime inventory controls and locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores our domestic auto parts stores utilize our computerized store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 

store development the following table reflects domestic auto parts store development during the past five fiscal years  10 we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve and in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older “our kind of vehicles” okvs as these are no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranty and will require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in new urban markets in a relatively short period of time to achieve economies of scale in distribution and marketing costs in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we may occasionally evaluate potential acquisition candidates 

purchasing and supply chain merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support center in memphis tennessee no one class of product accounts for as much as 10 percent of our total sales in fiscal 2003 no single supplier accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases we generally have few longterm contracts for the purchase of merchandise we believe that we have excellent relationships with suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for substantially all types of product sold our vendors ship substantially all of our merchandise to our distribution centers stores typically place orders on a weekly basis with merchandise shipped from the warehouse generally within 24 hours of receipt of the order our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to each store a hub store is able to provide replenishment of sold products and deliver special order products to a store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours hub stores are replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years this financial review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements presented in this form 10k fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 for the year ended august 30 2003 autozone reported sales of 5457 billion 52 weeks compared with 5326 billion 53 weeks for the year ended august 31 2002 a 25 increase from fiscal 2002 at august 30 2003 we operated 3219 domestic auto parts stores and 49 in mexico compared with 3068 domestic auto parts stores and 39 in mexico at august 31 2002 excluding sales from the extra week included in the prior year sales were up 46 see reconciliation of nongaap financial measures same store sales or sales for domestic stores open at least one year increased approximately 3 during the year including flat retail same store sales and an increase for commercial sales in same stores by approximately 27 the improvement in same store sales was due more to an increase in average dollars spent per transaction over the amounts in the same period of the prior year than an increase in customer count the balance of the increase of 46 was due to new store sales for fiscal 2003 which contributed 19 percentage points of the increase alldata and mexico sales which contributed 05 percentage points of the increase while truckpro sales in the prior year of 476 million reduced the increase by 09 percentage points gross profit for fiscal 2003 was 2515 billion or 461 of net sales compared with 2375 billion or 446 of net sales for fiscal 2002 operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal

fiscal years 2003 and 2002 were impacted by the following nonrecurring or infrequent items  20  for fiscal 2003 excluding the above items gross profit as a percentage of sales improved by 07 percentage points while operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined by 19 percentage points comparable operating profit for fiscal 2003 increased by 239 as operating margin improved 26 percentage points to 168 from 142 last year see reconciliation of nongaap financial measures the improvements in gross profit and gross margin reflect the additive impact of new merchandise a reduction in our product warranty expense and the benefit of more strategic and disciplined pricing derived from our category management system improvements in operating profit and operating margin reflect our relentless expense discipline in particular the leveraging of salaries and information technology spending during fiscal 2003 net interest expense for fiscal 2003 was 848 million compared with 799 million during fiscal 2002 the increase in interest expense for fiscal 2003 was primarily due to higher levels of debt compared with the 2002 fiscal year weightedaverage borrowings for fiscal 2003 were 151 billion compared with 133 billion for fiscal 2002 and weightedaverage borrowing rates excluding the impact of debt amortization and facility fees remained relatively flat at 44 for both fiscal years autozone’s effective income tax rate declined slightly to 379 of pretax income for fiscal 2003 as compared to 381 for fiscal 2002  net income for fiscal 2003 increased by 209 to 5176 million and diluted earnings per share increased by 335 to 534 from 400 reported for the yearago period excluding the nonrecurring infrequent items listed above comparable net income increased 264 and

39 in mexico compared with 3019 domestic auto parts stores 21 in mexico and 49 truckpro stores at august 25 2001 excluding sales from the extra week in fiscal 2002 net sales increased 83 see reconciliation of nongaap financial measures same store sales or sales for domestic stores open at least one year increased approximately 9 during fiscal 2002 including an increase in retail same store sales of approximately 8 and an increase for commercial sales in same stores by approximately 17 comparable store sales increased in fiscal 2002 as a result of an increase in customer count and an increase in average dollars spent per transaction over the amounts in the 2001 fiscal year new stores contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the increase during fiscal 2002 whereas the overall sales increase was somewhat offset by the decrease in sales associated with truckpro which was sold in december 2001 of 476 million 21 in fiscal 2002 and 1485 million in fiscal 2001 alldata and mexico sales composed the remainder of the increase in sales during fiscal 2002 gross profit for fiscal 2002 was 2375 billion or 446  of net sales compared with 2013 billion or 418 of net sales for fiscal 2001 excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2002 and the nonrecurring charges in fiscal 2001 gross profit for fiscal 2002 was 2325 billion or 446 of net sales compared with 2043 billion or 424 of net sales for fiscal 2001 see reconciliation of nongaap financial measures gross margin improvement for fiscal 2002 reflected lower product costs more efficient supply chain costs reduced inventory shrinkage the benefits of more strategic and disciplined pricing due to category management and the addition of more valueadded highmargin merchandise than in the 2001 fiscal year operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2002 increased by 1055 million over such expenses for fiscal 2001 but declined as a percentage of net sales from 311 to 301 the improved ratio reflected the fact that revenues rose more rapidly than the growth of storelevel expenses a 11 percentage point improvement combined with operating savings resulting from the restructuring in fiscal 2001 related to controlling staffing base salaries and technology spending of 04 percentage points additionally the 2001 fiscal year included other expenses related to strategic initiatives not included in the restructuring and impairment charges of 03 percentage points the adoption of new accounting rules for goodwill reduced operating expenses in fiscal 2002 by approximately 86 million or 02 percentage points these improvements in the expense ratio were partially offset by additional bonus legal pension and insurance expenses incurred in the 2002 fiscal year of 11 percentage points net interest expense for fiscal 2002 was 799 million compared with 1007 million during fiscal 2001 the decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2002 was primarily due to lower levels of debt compared with the 2001 fiscal year and lower average borrowing rates weighted average borrowings for fiscal 2002 were 133 billion compared with 145 billion for fiscal 2001 additionally weighted average borrowing rates excluding the impact of debt amortization and facility fees were lower in the 2002 year compared with the 2001 fiscal year at 44 compared with 62 autozone’s effective income tax rate was 381 of pretax income for fiscal 2002 and 388 for fiscal 2001 the decrease in the tax rate is due primarily to the change in goodwill accounting net income for fiscal 2002 increased to 4281 million from 1755 and diluted earnings per share increased to 400 from 154 reported for fiscal 2001 excluding the positive impact of the extra week in fiscal 2002 and the restructuring and

from 238 for fiscal 2001 see reconciliation of nongaap financial measures the impact of the fiscal 2002 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2002 was an increase of 016 22 inflation autozone does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation we have been successful in many cases in mitigating the effects of merchandise cost increases principally through efficiencies gained through economies of scale selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers seasonality and quarterly periods autozone’s business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales occurring in the summer months of june through august in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december through february during short periods of time a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states each of the first three quarters of autozone’s fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks 17 weeks in fiscal 2002 because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks 17 weeks in fiscal 2002 compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 represented 335 of annual net sales and 401 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 represented 346 of annual net sales and 416 of net income fiscal 2002 consisted of 53 weeks with the fiscal fourth quarter including 17 weeks accordingly the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 included the benefit of an additional week of net sales of 1091 million and net income of 183 million liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was 6983 million in fiscal 2003 7391 million in fiscal 2002 and 4589 million in fiscal 2001 cash flow generated from store operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories during the past three fiscal year periods we have improved our accounts payable to inventory ratio to 87 at august 30 2003 from 83 at august 31 2002 and 76 at august 25 2001 in each of the three year periods the improvement in this ratio was a source of cash from operations particularly in fiscal 2002 when the ratio increased 7 percentage points the increase in merchandise inventories required to support newstore development and sales growth has largely been financed by our vendors as evidenced by the higher accounts payable to inventory ratio 23 autozone’s primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program from the beginning of fiscal 1999 to august 30 2003 we have opened 562 net new domestic auto parts stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 1678 million in fiscal 2003 compared with 645 million in fiscal 2002 and 1221 million in fiscal 2001 the increase in cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 is due primarily to increased store development activities in the current year and proceeds from the sale of the truckpro business in the prior year we invested 1822 million in capital assets in fiscal 2003 compared with 1172 million in fiscal 2002 and 1693 million in fiscal 2001 new store openings in the us were 160 for fiscal 2003 102 for fiscal 2002 and 107 for fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2002 we sold truckpro our heavyduty truck parts subsidiary which operated 49 stores for cash proceeds of 257 million proceeds from capital asset disposals totaled 144 million for fiscal 2003 251 million for fiscal 2002 and 446 million for fiscal 2001 net cash used in financing activities was 5302 million in fiscal 2003 6754 million in fiscal 2002 and 3365 million in fiscal 2001 the net cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock which totaled 8911 million for fiscal 2003 6990 million for fiscal 2002 and 3661 million for fiscal 2001 fiscal 2003 net proceeds from the issuance of debt securities including repayments on other debt and the net change in commercial paper borrowings offset the increased level of treasury stock purchases by approximately 322 million we expect to open approximately 195 new stores during fiscal 2004 our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required by expansion we believe that we will be able to continue to finance much of our inventory requirements through favorable payment terms from suppliers depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance will be funded through borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past credit ratings at august 30 2003 autozone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from standard  poor’s of bbb and a commercial paper rating of a2 moody’s investors service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of baa2 and a commercial paper rating of p2 as of august 30 2003 both moody’s and standard  poor’s had autozone listed as having a “stable” outlook subsequent to the 2003 fiscal year end moody’s changed our outlook to “negative” while confirming autozone’s existing credit ratings if our credit ratings drop our interest expense may increase similarly we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will 24 increase as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit if our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade our access to financing may become more limited debt facilities we maintain 950 million of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks of the 950 million 300 million expires in may 2004 the remaining 650 million expires in may 2005 the portion expiring in may 2004 includes a renewal feature as well as an option to extend the maturity date of the thenoutstanding debt by one year the credit facilities exist largely to support commercial paper borrowings and other short term unsecured bank loans at august 30 2003 outstanding commercial paper of 268 million the 6 notes due november 2003 of 150 million and other debt of 27 million are classified as long term as we have the ability and intention to refinance them on a long term basis the rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of the london interbank offered rate libor the lending bank’s base rate as defined in the agreement or a competitive bid rate at our option we have agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of our credit agreements including limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens and minimum fixed charge coverage as of august 30 2003 we are in compliance with all covenants on october 16 2002 we issued 300 million of 5875 senior notes the notes mature in october 2012 and interest is payable semiannually on april 15 and october 15 a portion of the proceeds from these senior notes was used to prepay a 115 million unsecured bank term loan due december 2003 to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and to settle interest rate hedges associated with the issuance and repayment of the related debt securities on june 3 2003 we issued 200 million of 4375 senior notes these senior notes mature in june 2013 and interest is payable semiannually on june 1 and december 1 the proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings to prepay 100 million of the 350 million unsecured bank loan due november 2004 and to settle interest rate hedges associated with the issuance of the debt securities on august 8 2003 we filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission which was declared effective on august 22 2003 this filing will allow us to sell up to 500 million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions no debt had been issued under this registration statement as of august 30 2003 all of the repayment obligations under our bank lines of credit may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if autozone experiences a change in control as defined in the agreements of autozone or its board of directors or if covenants are breached related to total indebtedness and minimum fixed charge coverage we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants 25 stock repurchases as of august 30 2003 our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 33 billion of common stock in the open market from january 1998 to august 30 2003 approximately 28 billion of common stock had been repurchased during fiscal 2003 we repurchased 8911 million of common stock at times in the past we utilized equity forward agreements to facilitate our repurchase of common stock there were no outstanding equity forward agreements for share repurchases as of august 30 2003 at august 31 2002 we held equity forward agreements which were settled in cash during fiscal 2003 for the purchase of approximately 22 million shares of common stock at an average cost of 6882 per share such obligations under equity forward agreements at august 31 2002 were not reflected on our balance sheet financial commitments the following table shows autozone’s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations  1 long term debt balances represent principal maturities excluding interest at august 30 2003 debt balances due in less than one year of 4207 million are classified as long term in our consolidated financial statements as we have the ability and intention to refinance them on a longterm basis 2 operating lease obligations include related interest the following table shows autozone’s other commitments which all have expiration periods of less than one year  offbalance sheet arrangements the above table reflects the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august 30 2003 a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily 26 renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our balance sheet the letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements have automatic renewal clauses in conjunction with our commercial sales program we offer credit to some of our commercial customers the receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse autozone has recorded a reserve for this recourse at august 30 2003 the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of 421 million and the balance of the recourse reserve was 26 million guarantee and indemnification arrangements during fiscal 2003 autozone adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 effective for interim and annual periods ending after december 15 2002 fin 45 elaborates on the disclosures that must be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and indemnities it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by autozone after december 31 2002 if these arrangements are within the scope of fin 45 the adoption of fin 45 did not have a significant impact on autozone’s consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies product warranties limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime warranties are provided to our customers by autozone or the vendors supplying its products warranty costs relating to merchandise sold under warranty not covered by vendors are estimated and recorded as warranty obligations at the time of sale based on each product’s historical return rate we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount as necessary litigation and other contingent liabilities we have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business such as employment matters product liability general liability related to our store premises and alleged violation of the robinsonpatman act as specifically described in note m in the notes to consolidated financial statements generally we calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities such as lawsuits and our retained liability for insured claims 27 vendor allowances autozone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors based on the volume of purchases or for services that autozone provides to the vendors monies received from vendors include rebates allowances and promotional funds typically these funds are dependent on purchase volumes and advertising plans the amounts to be received are subject to changes in market conditions vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sellthrough of the related merchandise for autozone rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product sales these monies are treated as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold certain vendor allowances are used exclusively for promotions and to partially or fully offset certain other direct expenses such vendor funding arrangements that were entered into on or before december 31 2002 were recognized as a reduction to selling general and administrative expenses when earned however for such vendor funding arrangements entered into or modified after december 31 2002 autozone applied the new guidance pursuant to the emerging issues task force issue no 0216 “accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor” eitf issue no 0216 accordingly all such vendor funds are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold the new accounting pronouncement for vendor funding does not impact the way autozone runs its business or its relationships with vendors it does however require the deferral of certain vendor funding which is calculated based upon vendor inventory turns based on the timing of the issuance of the pronouncement and guidelines we were precluded from adopting eitf issue no 0216 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle our timing and accounting treatment of eitf issue no 0216 was not discretionary impairments in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas 144 we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long lived assets such as property and equipment covered by this standard whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as part of the evaluation we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment we compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas 142 we perform an annual test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists we perform the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments if impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment 28 loss such evaluations require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation is performed which could differ from actual results restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2001 autozone recorded restructuring and impairment charges of 1568 million including restructuring accruals of 296 million the accrued obligations for restructuring charges totaled approximately 125 million at august 30 2003 and 181 million at august 31 2002 the original charges and activity in the restructuring accruals is described more fully in note l in the notes to consolidated financial statements during fiscal 2002 we reevaluated remaining excess properties related to the fiscal 2001 impairment charges and determined that several properties could be developed this resulted in the reversal of accrued lease obligations totaling 64 million we also determined that additional writedowns of 90 million were needed to state remaining excess properties at fair value in addition we recognized 26 million of gains in fiscal 2002 as a result of closing certain stores associated with the restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2003 autozone recognized 46 million of gains as a result of the disposition of properties associated with the restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2001 included in the fiscal 2001 impairment and restructure charges were asset writedowns and contractual obligations aggregating 299 million related to the planned sale of truckpro our heavyduty truck parts subsidiary in december 2001 truckpro was sold to a group of investors for cash proceeds of 257 million and a promissory note a deferred gain of 36 million was recorded as part of the sale due to uncertainties associated with the realization of the gain during fiscal 2003 the note was paid and certain liabilities were settled as a result a total pretax gain of 47 million was recognized in income during fiscal 2003 as part of operating selling general and administrative expenses no other significant gains or charges are anticipated under the fiscal 2001 restructuring plan value of pension assets at august 30 2003 the fair market value of autozone’s pension assets was 867 million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was 1361 million on january 1 2003 our defined benefit pension plans were frozen accordingly plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas and no new participants may join the plans the material assumptions for fiscal 2003 are an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 8 and a discount rate of 6 for additional information regarding autozone’s qualified and nonqualified pension plans refer to note j in the notes to consolidated financial statements 29 recent accounting pronouncements in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 fin 46 clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties fin 46 requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in which a company absorbs a majority of another entity’s expected losses or residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the other entity these entities are called variable interest entities fin 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created or acquired after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied at the end of periods ending after december 15 2003 the company is currently evaluating the impact of fin 46 and does not expect its adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 

risk factors we may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates we have increased our domestic store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 2657 stores at august 29 1998 to 3219 stores at august 30 2003 an average store count increase per year of 4 in addition a portion of our total sales increases each year resulted from increases in sales at existing stores we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores at historical rates or increase same store sales our business depends upon qualified employees at the end of fiscal 2003 our consolidated employee count was approximately 49000 we can not assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors in the short term it may depend upon  30  if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price autozone competes in both the retail diy and commercial difm auto parts and accessories markets competitors include national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores department stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may have competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline if we cannot profitably increase market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial difm market to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket jobbers and 31 warehouse distributors in addition to other auto parts retailers that have entered the commercial business although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability and distribution locations some automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have larger available inventories we can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers if our vendors continue to consolidate we may pay higher prices for our merchandise recently several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business recently several large auto parts chains have merged we do not know the impact these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive aftermarket if our competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are stronger war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 32 reconciliation of nongaap financial measures  “selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include the following financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” the following nongaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value  in addition the impact of certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance was excluded in the determination of certain financial measures presented in “selected financial data” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” we believe that the resulting nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because these measures indicate more clearly our comparative yeartoyear operating results the following nonrecurring or infrequent items were all identified as “adjustments” for comparative purposes  nongaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures or considered in isolation for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance financial position or cash flows however we have presented the nongaap financial measures as we believe they provide additional information to analyze or compare our operations furthermore our management and compensation committee of the board of directors use the abovementioned nongaap financial measures to analyze

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk autozone is exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various financial instruments to reduce such risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations hedging costs and past changes in the associated foreign exchange rates no instruments have been utilized to reduce this market risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our board of directors further we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes interest rate risk autozone’s financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps autozone has utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at august 30 2003 we held an interest rate swap contract with a september 2003 maturity date to hedge 25 million of variable rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings at august 30 2003 we also held treasury lock agreements with notional amounts of 300 million and forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts of 200 million these agreements which expire in november 2003 are used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates relating to anticipated debt transactions it is expected that upon settlement of the agreements the realized gain or loss will be deferred in other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt in addition during fiscal 2003 we entered into and settled a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of 200 million used to hedge the variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to autozone’s issuance of 200 million 4375 senior notes the loss realized upon settlement was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying senior notes resulting in an effective interest rate of 565 at august 31 2002 we held interest rate swap contracts related to 190 million of variable rate debt of the 190 million 115 million of the swaps due in december 2003 were used to hedge the variable rate debt associated with autozone’s 115 million term loan the remaining 75 million of swaps with expiration dates throughout fiscal years 2003 and 2004 were designated to hedge the variable rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings additionally at august 31 2002 we held treasury lock agreements with notional amounts of 300 million that expired in october 2002 and hedged the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to autozone’s issuance of 300 million 5875 senior notes the loss realized upon settlement was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying senior notes resulting in an effective interest rate of 633 a portion of the proceeds generated 39 from the issuance of the senior notes was used to prepay a 115 million term loan accordingly the related interest rate swap agreements were settled in cash and the realized loss was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying term loan autozone reflects the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments on our balance sheet the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related interest rates being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the interest rate being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income for the years ended august 30 2003 and august 31 2002 all of our hedge instruments were determined to be highly effective and no ineffective portion was recognized in income the fair values of the interest rate hedge instruments at august 30 2003 were an asset of 416 million the fair values of the interest rate hedge instruments at august 31 2002 were a liability of 104 million the fair value of autozone’s debt was estimated at 157 billion as of august 30 2003 and 122 billion as of august 31 2002 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to autozone for debt of the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt at august 30 2003 by 273 million and greater than the carrying value of debt at august 31 2002 by 272 million we had 5568 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 30 2003 and 6998 million outstanding at august 31 2002 both of which exclude the effect of interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges of such variable rate debt at these borrowing levels for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on autozone’s pretax earnings and cash flows of 53 million in 2003 and 51 million in fiscal 2002 which includes the effects of interest rate swaps the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had 9900 million of fixed rate debt outstanding at august 30 2003 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of autozone’s fixed rate debt of 470 million fuel price risk fuel swap contracts utilized by autozone have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas 133 and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment although the instruments were executed to economically hedge the consumption of diesel fuel used to distribute our products accordingly marktomarket gains and losses related to such fuel swap contracts are recorded in cost of sales as a component of distribution costs as of august 30 2003 no fuel swap contracts were outstanding during fiscal 2003 we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure between april and august 2003 these swaps were settled prior to august 30 2003 and had no significant impact on cost of sales for fiscal year 2003 40

 item 1 business introduction   we are the nations leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories with most of our sales to doityourself diy customers we began operations in 1979 and at august 25 2001 operated 3019 auto parts stores in the united states and 21 in mexico each auto parts store carries an extensive product line for cars vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items and accessories we also have a commercial sales program in the united states that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local repair garages dealers and service stations we do not sell tires nor do we perform automotive repair or installation   in addition we sell automotive diagnostic and repair information software through our alldata subsidiary and diagnostic and repair information through alldatadiycom    at august 25 2001 our auto parts stores were in the following states    marketing and merchandising strategy   we are dedicated to providing customers with superior service value and quality automotive parts and products at conveniently located welldesigned stores key elements of this strategy are   customer service   we believe that our customers value customer service therefore customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy we emphasize that our autozoners employees should always put customers first our electronic parts catalogs assist in the selection of parts we offer free testing of starters alternators batteries sensors and actuators and we were among the first auto parts companies to offer lifetime warranties on many of the parts we sell our satellite system in our auto parts stores helps us to speed up credit card and check approval processes and locate parts at neighboring autozone stores   our stores generally open at 8 am and close between 8 and 10 pm with some open 24 hours monday through saturday and typically open at 9 am and close between 6 and 8 pm on sunday   autozone also provides specialty tools in our loanatool program customers can borrow a specialty tool such as a steering wheel puller that a doityourself customer or a small repair shop would have no use for other than for a single job   products   this table shows the types of products we sell in our auto parts stores      we believe that the satisfaction of diy and professional technician customers often is impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested our auto parts stores generally offer between 19000 and 22000 stock keeping units skus covering a broad range of vehicle types each auto parts store carries the same basic product line with some regional differences based on climate demographics and age and type of vehicle registration our flexogram program enables us to tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models of the automobiles in each stores trade area we also offer a range of lower turnover products through overnight delivery to our auto parts stores and at hub stores that carry a larger range of products   pricing   we employ an everyday low price strategy and want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at a good price with a good warranty and backed by outstanding customer service our prices are generally structured to meet the lowest price offered by a competitor for a product and we believe that our prices overall compare favorably to those of our competitors   commercial sales program   our commercial sales program provides credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local repair garages dealers and service stations the program operated out of 1638 stores as of august 25 2001 in addition we have opened 39 hub stores that offer a greater range of parts and products desired by commercial customers and that can be used as additive inventory for local stores   store design and visual merchandising   we design and build stores for a high visual impact the typical autozone store has an industrial high tech appearance by utilizing colorful exterior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors maintenance products accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products in floor displays endcaps and on the shelf store managers are able to customize areas of the store to prominently display products that are in demand in the local community   store operations   store formats   as of august 25 2001 we had domestic auto parts stores in the following square footage ranges      substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each stores square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is fronted by a counter that generally runs the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of accessories and maintenance items   we have knowledgeable autozoners employees available to assist customers with their parts needs utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a video screen which is visible to both the autozoner and the customer the parts catalog will suggest additional items that a customer should purchase in order to properly install the part being purchased   we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking approximately 2300 of our auto parts stores are freestanding with the balance principally located within strip shopping centers freestanding large format stores typically have parking for approximately 40 to 45 cars on a lot of approximately 34 to one acre our smaller auto parts stores typically have parking for approximately 25 to 35 cars and are usually located on a lot of approximately 12 to 34 acre   store personnel and training   each auto parts store typically employs from six to eighteen autozoners including a manager and an assistant manager autozoners typically have prior automotive experience all autozoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry although we rely primarily on onthejob training we also provide formal training programs including regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program where autozoners can obtain certification in several areas of technical expertise from both the company and from independent certification agencies training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management   store managers get financial incentives through performancebased bonuses and grants of stock options in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain quality autozoners   our domestic auto parts stores are primarily supervised through district managers who oversee approximately six to ten stores each and who report to regional managers regional managers with approximately fiftyfive to sixtyfive stores each in turn report to five vice presidentsstore operations purchasing merchandising advertising accounting cash management store development systems technology and support and other store support functions are centralized in our store support center in memphis tennessee we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategy at the store level and reduces expenses and cost of goods   store automation   all auto parts stores have proprietary electronic parts catalogs that provide parts information based on the make model and year of an automobile the catalog display screens are placed on the hard parts counter where both autozoners and customers can view the screen in addition our satellite system enables the auto parts stores to speed up credit card and check approval processes and locate parts at neighboring autozone stores   our domestic auto parts stores utilize our computerized store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures store development   this table shows the domestic auto parts store development during the past five fiscal years      1 includes stores obtained in chief and auto palace acquisitions in 1998 and store real estate acquired from pep boys in fiscal year 1999   2 closed stores include replaced stores     we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve and in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store is its projected future profitability key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in new urban markets in a relatively short period of time in order to achieve economies of scale in advertising and distribution costs in addition to continuing to construct our own stores we occasionally evaluate potential acquisition candidates in new as well as in existing markets purchasing and supply chain   merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores at our store support center in memphis no one class of product accounts for as much as ten percent of our total sales in fiscal 2001 no single supplier accounted for more than seven percent of our total purchases and our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 32 percent of our purchases we generally have few longterm contracts for the purchase of merchandise we believe that we have excellent relationships with suppliers we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar cost for substantially all types of product sold   our vendors ship substantially all of our merchandise to our distribution centers stores typically place orders on a weekly basis with merchandise shipped from the warehouse in our trucks on the following day   we want to have the right merchandise in our stores at the right time in the past two fiscal years we have improved our supply chain by eliminating excess inventory and increasing our purchasing terms while increasing sales this has resulted in increases in inventory turns and substantial increases in net inventory turns competition   autozone competes in both the diy and professional technician auto parts markets primary competitors include national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers and auto dealers although auto parts stores are the most important retail outlets for diy customers some aftermarket vehicle supplies chemicals accessories and tools are also available at discount and department stores hardware stores supermarkets drug stores and home stores auto parts retailers have remained competitive in the diy aftermarket by offering superior product knowledge and an extensive number of products in stock autozone competes on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise selection and

control since 1998 previously she was director of process improvement since 1996 risk factors we may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates   we have significantly increased our domestic store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 1143 stores at august 25 1996 to 3019 stores at august 25 2001 an average store count increase per year of 16 we do not plan to continue our store count growth rate at the historic pace in addition a portion of our total sales increases each year results from increases in sales at existing stores we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to increase same store sales as our stores mature in their markets we have an everincreasing need for qualified employees   in fiscal year 2001 our consolidated employee count increased from approximately 43200 at the beginning of the year to about 44600 a 3 increase in the year we do not know if we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected   demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors in the short term it may depend upon the weather as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather however as autozone stores are geographically disbursed isolated instances of inclimate weather will generally not have a material effect upon our aggregate sales the economy as during periods of good economic conditions more of our doityourself customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles this factor is tempered by our commercial parts sales program that sells parts to installers in periods of declining economic conditions both doityourself and doitforme customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair for the long term demand for our products may depend upon the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty offered on new vehicles if we cannot profitably increase market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited   although we are one of the five largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial doitforme market to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors in addition to other auto parts retailers that have recently entered the commercial business some of these jobbers and warehouse distributors have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have larger available inventories we can make no assurance that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers if we cannot profitably open and operate stores in international markets our sales growth may be limited   we opened our first auto parts stores in mexico during fiscal year 1999 although we believe that great potential exists for auto parts stores in the fragmented international auto parts market we have little experience opening or operating stores outside of the united states and no assurances can be made that we can open additional stores in mexico or stores in any other country in a timely or profitable manner   in addition products sold in mexico must be properly labeled for sale in accordance with mexican law if autozone cannot source products in mexico it must obtain products elsewhere and have them appropriately labeled for sale in mexico we can make no assurances that we can purchase goods of appropriate quality or in sufficient quantities in mexico to sell in our stores nor can we make any assurances that we can profitably obtain products outside of mexico and have them relabeled in accordance with mexican law if our vendors continue to consolidate we may pay higher prices for our merchandise   recently several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business   recently several large auto parts chains have announced plans to merge we do not know what impact these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive aftermarket if our merging competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are strongest war acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales   in the event of war acts of terrorism or either are threatened it may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected in addition a significant amount of the merchandise sold in our mexico stores is exported from the united states if we cannot export this merchandise in a timely manner sales in our mexico stores may be adversely affected   in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores
