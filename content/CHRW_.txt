transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by investing in and retaining talented employees developing innovative proprietary systems and processes and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contracted motor carriers railroads and ocean and air carriers we make a profit driven by the value we provide our customers and the resulting difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight 

we provide the following transportation and logistics services 

• truckload through our contracts with motor carriers we have access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity through the use of navisphere we connect our customers with contracted motor carriers that specialize in their transportation lanes and product types and we help contracted motor carriers optimize the usage of their equipment 

• ltl ltl transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight we primarily focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger although we handle any size shipment through our contracts with motor carriers and use of navisphere we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight in many instances we consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads 

• ocean as a licensed nonvessel ocean common carrier “nvocc” and freight forwarder we consolidate shipments determine routing select ocean carriers contract for ocean shipments andor provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments 

• air as a certified indirect air carrier “iac” and freight forwarder we organize air shipments and provide doortodoor service

• other logistics services we provide intermodal transportation service which is the shipment of freight in containers or trailers by a combination of truck and rail in addition we provide feebased managed services warehousing services small parcel and other services 

customers communicate their freight needs typically on an orderbyorder basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account either directly or through highly automated connections established between navisphere and the customers transportation management system the ch robinson team then ensures that all necessary information regarding each shipment is available in navisphere we utilize the information from navisphere and other available sources to select the best contracted carrier based upon factors such as their service score equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors 

once the contracted carrier is selected we receive the contracted carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation during the time when a shipment is executed we connect frequently either electronically or manually with the contracted carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities our technology our global suite of services and available modes of transportation some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price

our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer our services to the customer may be priced on a spot market or transactional basis or prearranged contractual rates most of our contractual rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements that allow for fuel to primarily act as a passthrough cost in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase most of our truckload services from our contracted truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in some cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contracted motor carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract or to provide transportation services within dense transportation lanes in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contracted motor carriers there is typically a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

while providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a global basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we analyze customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may also provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation customs brokerage supply chain consulting and analysis emission analytics optimization and reporting for which we are usually paid separately

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by our customers in many instances we consolidate an individual customer’s produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet both ours and our customers’ service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and available capacity during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight so these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2021 we worked with approximately 85000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with contracted motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with them and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contracted motor carriers to work with us we have a policy of contracted motor carrier invoice payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in accordance with our standard payment terms for those contracted motor carriers that would like a faster payment we also offer expedited payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity these contracted motor carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contracted motor carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2021 contracted motor carriers that had fewer than 100 trucks transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2021 every united states and canadian motor carrier we do business with is required to execute a contract that establishes the motor carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and thereafter through subscriptions with a thirdparty service we confirm that each united states contracted motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and can provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the contracted motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and typically the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a contracted motor carrier 

in our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes

seasonality 

our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends as a result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we contractually require and rely on the motor carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted motor carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability

business environment and competition risk factors 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations currency fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

• decrease in volumes a reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace may reduce our opportunities for growth a significant portion of our freight are transactional or spot market opportunities the transactional market may be more impacted than the contractual freight market by supply chain disruptions or overall economic conditions in addition if a downturn in our customers’ business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage retail manufacturing paper ecommerce or printing industries our operating results could be adversely affected 

• credit risk and working capital some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us and some may go out of business in addition some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past which may cause our working capital needs to increase 

• transportation provider failures a significant number of our contracted transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers 

• expense management we may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it may be more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in addition we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand 

higher carrier prices may result in decreased adjusted gross profit margin and increases in working capital carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our adjusted gross profit and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for over the road transportation services and changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase motor carrier pricing in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a loss as our volumes increase or we increase freight rates charged to our customers the resulting increase in revenues may increase our working capital needs due to our business model which generally has a higher length of days sales outstanding than days payables outstanding 

changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our adjusted gross profit margins in our truckload transportation business fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased adjusted gross profit margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted motor carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our adjusted gross profit margin may also fluctuate adjusted gross profit margin is a nongaap financial measure calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues for additional information see item 7 of part ii management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including but not limited to shipment status information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us which may prevent us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

• equipment and driver shortages in the transportation industry particularly among contracted motor carriers 

• changes in regulations impacting transportation 

• disruption in the supply or cost of fuel 

• reduction or deterioration in rail service and 

• unanticipated changes in freight markets 

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against traditional and nontraditional logistics companies including transportation providers that own equipment thirdparty freight brokers technology matching services internet freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and ondemand transportation service providers we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our adjusted gross profit and income from operations in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a loss 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions including but not limited to flood drought freeze insects disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers’ ability to grow and harvest marketable crops 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes or significant disruptions in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future the transportation industry may also be significantly impacted by disruptions such as port congestion the availability of transportation equipment and labor shortages these disruptions may impact our ability to provide transportation services for our customers and may adversely impact our results of operations and operating cash flows 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders

company risk factors 

we rely on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems and also rely on technology provided by third parties our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users the continued automation of existing processes and usage of thirdparty technology and cloud network capacity will require adaptation and adjustments that may increase our exposure to cybersecurity risks and system availability reliance we rely on our technology staff and thirdparty vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain protect and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers 

as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our operating systems in the past and may occur on our operating systems in the future previous attacks on our operating systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks a loss for which we are not adequately insured could materially affect our financial results the coverage we currently have in place may not apply to a particular loss or it may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities to which we may be subject 

though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our operating systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

• changes in tariffs trade restrictions trade agreements and taxations 

• difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents 

• limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls 

• different liability standards and 

• intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property including but not limited to our proprietary information systems to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it may be more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenue and adjusted gross profit from our largest customers our top 100 customers comprise approximately 33 percent of our consolidated total revenue and 26 percent of consolidated adjusted gross profit our largest customer comprises approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenue the sudden loss of major customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we may experience heightened difficulties in integrating the acquired companies we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price there can be no assurance that our longterm growth targets will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price 

governmental regulatory and legal risk factors 

changes to income tax regulations in the us and other jurisdictions where we operate may increase our tax liability we are subject to income taxes in the us and other jurisdictions where we operate changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions where we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and reduce our operating cash flows 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the motor carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted motor carrier we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance we also require all contracted motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law most contracted motor carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements as well as cargo insurance in varying policy amounts railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier cargo loss or damage liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipme nt although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for the contracted motor carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them cl aims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a primary retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted motor carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

in north america as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international or domestic air shipments although we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers cargo from time to time claims may be asserted against us for cargo losses we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 155 million umbrella where we carry retentions between 05 million and 5 million

buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 155 million for product liability claims subject to a 500000 per incident deductible settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as associated consequential damages we carry product recall and contamination insurance coverage of 30 million a loss for which we are not adequately insured could materially affect our financial results the coverage we currently have in place may not apply to a particular loss or it may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities to which we may be subject this policy has a retention of 35 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs which could materially and adversely affect our operating results loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the dot to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the fmc as an ocean freight forwarder and nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified iac providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the iata and federal regulations issued by the tsa we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the us customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the usda as required by paca we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate owned or leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been or will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may be materially and adversely affected as a result 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the us and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

our contracted motor carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including transitional risks relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements including evolving transportation technology in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services

general risk factors 

we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including

we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events including the physical impacts of climate change  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

in addition the company is continuously monitoring the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic which has already caused a significant disruption to global financial markets and supply chains and has resulted in numerous travel restrictions and the shutdown of certain businesses across the globe we have experienced changes and volatility in demand including declines in certain industries and regions along with volatile pricing in response to the covid19 pandemic we have adopted workfromhome arrangements and many of our employees are working remotely while executing their duties and responsibilities the extent to which the ongoing covid19 pandemic impacts our operating results will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of outbreaks the emergence of covid19 variants and the effectiveness of local state federal and international actions that are being taken to contain and treat it there continues to be uncertainty around the duration of the covid19 pandemic and its broader impact on the economy and therefore the effects it will have on our operations and financial results remain uncertain if economic or market conditions in key global markets deteriorate it may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and we may experience material adverse effects on our financial positions

market trends 

the north american surface transportation market experienced extremely tight carrier capacity in 2021 as strong demand combined with ongoing driver availability and supply chain disruptions caused by port congestion and weather events drove purchased transportation to historic levels this compared to an extremely volatile market in 2020 resulting from the early stages of the covid19 pandemic and restrictions implemented to control the outbreak which drove significant volatility in customer demand and carrier capacity industry freight volumes as measured by the cass freight index increased approximately 13 percent in 2021 compared to 2020 and experienced growth in each quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 this compared to a decline of approximately eight percent in 2020 compared to 2019 with significant volatility over the course of 2020 one of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our managed services business routing guide depth is calculated as a simple average of all accepted shipments over all tender instances for any shipment facilitated by our managed services business the average routing guide depth was 17 in 2021 compared to 14 in 2020 the average routing guide depth increased steadily during the second half of 2020 and finished in line with those seen over the duration of 2021 

the global forwarding market has also been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions caused by ongoing port congestion along with equipment and labor shortages in 2021 these disruptions combined with strong demand have continued to drive purchased transportation costs for both ocean and air freight to historic levels as with the north american surface transportation market this compared to the significant volatility seen in 2020 resulting from the covid19 pandemic in 2020 the covid19 pandemic resulted in a sharp decline in commercial air freight capacity and periods of significantly reduced ocean freight demand due to factory closures followed by a rapid surge of demand in the second half of 2020 when production resumed and companies began to replenish low inventory levels amidst the market uncertainty 

business trends 

our 2021 surface transportation results were impacted by the rising cost and price environment summarized in the market trends section above we did not however experience the significant year over year volume volatility seen in the industry as measured by the cass freight index industry freight volumes increased approximately 13 percent in 2021 compared to a decline of eight percent in 2020 our combined nast truckload and ltl volume increased 55 percent in both 2021 and 2020 the covid19 pandemic had a significant impact on our small business customers in 2020 as our customer count decreased nearly 12 percent driven almost entirely by small and emerging market customers throughout the covid19 pandemic we have continued to work with our customers to meet our contractual commitments which has resulted in a higher than normal percentage of shipments with negative adjusted gross profit margins and less volatility in our combined nast truckload and ltl volumes as compared to the cass freight index we have continued to reshape our portfolio by adapting our pricing to reflect the rising cost environment and participating to a greater extent in the spot market the strong demand and tight carrier capacity conditions in 2021 resulted in our average truckload linehaul cost per mile excluding fuel costs increasing 305 percent our average truckload linehaul rate charged to our customers excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 290 percent in 2021 

in our global forwarding business we continued to experience significant increases in purchased transportation costs for both ocean and air freight due to the disruption caused by port congestion in addition to the equipment and labor shortages impacting the global forwarding market this along with increased volumes has resulted in strong growth in both total revenues and cost of transportation for our ocean and air freight services ocean volumes increased 170 percent in 2021 with strong growth in nearly all regions we serve driven by higher award sizes from existing customers and new customer growth in addition to the adverse impact to 2020 results from factory closures during the early stages of the covid19 pandemic throughout 2021 and 2020 we have augmented our air freight capacity with charter flights due to the significant commercial capacity shortages in the market which have resulted in larger than normal shipment sizes as compared to our prepandemic operations 

on june 3 2021 we acquired combinex holding bv “combinex” to strengthen our european road transportation presence for 147 million in cash on march 2 2020 we acquired prime distribution services “prime distribution” or “prime” a leading provider of retail consolidation services in north america for 2227 million in cash the acquisition was effective as of february 29 2020 and therefore the results of operations of prime distribution have been included as part of the nast segment in our consolidated financial statements since march 1 2020

total revenues and related costs total transportation revenues and purchased transportation and related services increased significantly driven by higher pricing and volumes in most service lines most notably ocean and truckload services the higher pricing was driven by the continued supply chain disruptions impacting both the global forwarding and surface transportation market discussed above in the market and business trends sections the prior year period was also impacted by the early stages of the covid19 pandemic which resulted in significant volatility to both pricing and volumes much of this volatility was the result of restrictions in place to control the outbreak which resulted in the sharp decline in commercial air freight capacity and periods of significantly reduced ocean freight demand due to factory closures this was followed by periods of rapid demand increases when production resumed and companies began to replenish low inventory levels amidst the market uncertainty and elevated demand for essential products

december 31 2020 working capital increased from 110 billion at december 31 2020 to 148 billion at december 31 2021 

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities 

the following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents dollars in thousands 

cash flow from operating activities the significant decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2021 from 2020 was due to unfavorable changes in working capital these changes in working capital were primarily related to a sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets partially offset by a related increase in accounts payable and accrued transportation expense both increases were driven by a significant increase in pricing for most of our transportation services in addition to increased volumes in nearly all services during 2021 the increase in accounts receivable was also impacted by a change in business mix from the significant growth of our global forwarding business where our days sales outstanding ratio is approximately double that of our nast business despite the increase in accounts receivable we are not experiencing a deterioration in the quality of our accounts receivable balance additionally since the early stages of the covid19 pandemic we have been closely monitoring credit and collections activities to minimize risk as well as working with our customers to facilitate the movement of goods across their supply chains while also ensuring timely payment 

cash used for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures consisted primarily of investments in hardware and software which are intended to increase employee productivity automate interactions with our customers and contracted carriers and improve our internal workflows to help expand our adjusted operating margins and grow the business during 2019 we sold a facility we owned in chicago illinois for approximately 170 million 

in 2021 we used 147 million for the acquisition of combinex in 2020 we used 2227 million for the acquisition of prime in 2019 we used 450 million for the acquisition of the space cargo group and 142 million for the acquisition of dema service spa 

we anticipate capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately 90 million to 100 million 

cash used for financing activities we had net borrowings on debt of 8227 million in 2021 and net repayments of 1430 million in 2020 the 2021 net borrowings were primarily to provide cash for operations as our working capital needs continued to increase throughout the year as mentioned above the 2020 net repayments were primarily to reduce the outstanding balance of the receivables securitization facility this receivables securitization facility expired in december 2020 and was not renewed however we entered into a new receivables securitization facility in november 2021 there was a 525 million outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit agreement” as of december 31 2021 compared to no outstanding balance as of december 31 2020  as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with 

t able of contents 

all of the covenants under the credit agreement the accounts receivable securitization note purchase agreement and senior unsecured notes 

the increase in cash dividends paid was the result of our fourth quarter 2020 dividend being paid on january 4 2021 near the end of the first quarter of 2020 we temporarily suspended our share repurchase activity as we assessed the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we resumed our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter of 2020 and throughout 2021 which resulted in the increase in share repurchases in 2021 in december 2021 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 20000000 shares as of december 31 2021 there were 21635388 shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential alternative uses of our cash and market conditions we may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes through open market cash purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 

although there continues to be uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the covid19 pandemic on our future results we believe that assuming no change in our current business plan our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facilities and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k we consider the following items in our consolidated financial statements to require significant estimation or judgment 

revenue recognition at contract inception we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify our performance obligations to provide distinct goods and services to our customers our transportation and logistics service arrangements often require management to use judgment and make estimates that impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 

transportation and logistics services  as a global logistics provider our primary performance obligation under our customer contracts is to utilize our relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies to efficiently and costeffectively transport our customers’ freight revenue is recognized for these performance obligations as they are satisfied over the contract term which generally represents the transit period the transit period can vary based upon the method of transport generally a number of days for over the road rail and air transportation or several weeks in the case of an ocean shipment 

recognizing revenue for contracts where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end requires management to make judgments that affect the amounts and timing of revenue recognized at period end at december 31 2021 we recorded revenue of 4537 million for services we have provided while a shipment was still intransit but for which we had not yet completed our performance obligation or had not yet invoiced our customer compared to 1972 million at december 31 2020 we utilize our historical knowledge of shipping lanes and estimated transit times to determine the transit period in cases where our customers’ freight has not reached its intended destination in addition we analyze contract data for the first few days following the reporting date combined with our historical experience of trends related to partially completed contracts as of the reporting date to determine our right to consideration for the services we have provided where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end differences in contract data for the first few days following the reporting date compared with our historical experience or disruptions such as weather events port congestion or other delays could cause the actual amount of revenue earned at period end to differ from these estimates 

total revenues represent the total dollar value of revenue recognized from contracts with customers for the goods and services we provide substantially all of our revenue is attributable to contracts with our customers most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to our customer and we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service additionally in our sourcing business in some cases we take inventory risk before the specified good has been transferred to our customer

customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing managed procurement transactions are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present see also note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  for further information regarding our revenue recognition policies 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually on november 30 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value “step zero analysis” if the step zero analysis indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value an additional impairment assessment is performed “step one analysis” as part of our step zero analysis we determined that the more likely than not criteria had not been met and therefore a step one analysis was not required 

when we perform a step one analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

in the step one analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations when a step one analysis is performed 

income tax reserves the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we establish reserves when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail in full or in part under us gaap if we determine that a tax position more likely than not will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 

we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities we reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit when there is i a completion of a tax audit ii effective settlement of an issue iii litigation of the issue including appeals iv a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance or v the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position andor cash flows uncertain income tax positions are included in “accrued income taxes” or “noncurrent income taxes payable” in the consolidated balance sheet

we have no financing lease obligations longterm liabilities consist primarily of noncurrent taxes payable and longterm notes payable due to the uncertainty with respect to the amounts or timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2021 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 429 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes as of december 31 2021 we do not have significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our debt facilities 

foreign exchange 

we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia oceania and south america as a result we frequently transact using currencies other than the us dollar primarily the chinese yuan euro canadian dollar and mexican peso this often results in assets and liabilities including intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency in these instances most commonly we have balances denominated in us dollars in regions where the us dollar is not the functional currency this results in foreign exchange risk 

foreign exchange risk can be quantified by performing a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact our primary foreign exchange risk is associated with balances denominated in us dollars held in china where the functional currency is the chinese yuan all other things being equal a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar against the chinese yuan on december 31 2021 would have decreased our net income by approximately 161 million and a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar against the chinese yuan on december 31 2021 would have increased our net income by approximately 132 million

transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by investing in and retaining talented employees developing innovative proprietary systems and processes and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contracted motor carriers railroads and ocean and air carriers we make a profit driven by the value we provide our customers and the resulting difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight 

we provide the following transportation and logistics services 

• truckload through our contracts with motor carriers we have access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity we connect our customers with contracted motor carriers that specialize in their transportation lanes and product types and we help contracted motor carriers optimize the usage of their equipment 

• ltl ltl transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight we primarily focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger although we handle any size shipment through our contracts with motor carriers and use of navisphere we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight in many instances we consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads 

• ocean as a licensed nonvessel ocean common carrier “nvocc” and freight forwarder we consolidate shipments determine routing select ocean carriers contract for ocean shipments andor provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments 

• air as a certified indirect air carrier “iac” and freight forwarder we organize air shipments and provide doortodoor service 

• customs our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by us customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies to assist importers and exporters in meeting regulatory and operational requirements governing imports and exports 

• other logistics services we provide intermodal transportation service which is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers by a combination of truck and rail in addition we provide feebased managed services warehousing services small parcel and other services 

customers communicate their freight needs typically on an orderbyorder basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account the team ensures that all necessary information regarding each shipment is available in navisphere this information is received electronically by navisphere from the customers system entered by our employees into navisphere or by the customer through our web tools we utilize the information from navisphere and other available sources to select the best contracted carrier based upon factors such as their service score equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors 

once the contracted carrier is selected we receive the contracted carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation during the time when a shipment is executed we connect frequently either electronically or manually with the contracted carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

table of content 

as a result of our logistics capabilities our technology and global suite of services some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer our services to the customer may be priced on a spot market or transactional basis or prearranged contractual rates most of our contractual rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements that allow for fuel to primarily act as a passthrough cost in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase most of our truckload services from our contracted truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contracted motor carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contracted motor carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

while providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a global basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we analyze customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

we have broadened our relationship with many of our customers through an emphasis on integrated logistics solutions resulting in us managing a greater portion of their supply chains we often serve our customers through specially created teams and through multiple locations our transportation and logistics services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network 

transportation services accounted for approximately 96 percent of adjusted gross profit in 2020  2019 and 2018 adjusted gross profit is a nongaap financial measure calculated as total revenues less the total of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale for additional information see item 7 of part ii management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

the table below shows our adjusted gross profit by transportation mode for the years ended december 31 in thousands 



sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by our customers in many instances we consolidate an individual customer’s produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers 

our sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and nationally licensed 

table of content 

brands these programs contain a wide variety of high quality fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs sourcing accounted for approximately four percent of our adjusted gross profit in 2020 2019 and 2018   

customer relationships 

we work to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services and people they can rely on during 2020 we served approximately 105000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2020 our largest customer accounted for approximately one percent of total revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace our unique information advantage and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines expertise and technology built by and for supply chain experts enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep datadriven understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive and shared services teams offices are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

markets and resources 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against many logistics companies including technologybased service companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services nvoccs iacs and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are

we rely on a combination of cyber security trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the united states and international locations 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet both ours and our customers’ service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and available capacity during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight so these relationships are critical to our success 

table of content 

in 2020 we worked with approximately 73000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with contracted motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with them and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contracted motor carriers to work with us we have a policy of contracted motor carrier invoice payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in accordance with our standard payment terms for those contracted motor carriers that would like a faster payment we also offer expedited payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity these contracted motor carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contracted motor carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2020 contracted motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 78 percent of our truckload shipments in 2020 every united states and canadian motor carrier which we do business with is required to execute a contract that establishes that the motor carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and thereafter through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each united states contracted motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and can provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the contracted motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and typically the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a contracted motor carrier 

in our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional iac in the united states and internationally we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

seasonality 

our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends as a result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

government regulation 

our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission “fmc” as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified iac providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association “iata” and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration “tsa” we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the us customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we contractually require and rely on the motor carrier 

table of content 

transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted motor carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture “usda” as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of other us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and other similar antibribery and anticorruption statutes 

human capital 

as of december 31 2020 we had a total of 14888 employees 12977 of whom are network employees as presented below our remaining employees centrally serve our network of offices in areas such as finance information technology and software engineering data science and analysis legal marketing and human resources the following table illustrates our employees by global region 



talent strategies 

our talented empowered and engaged employees continue to be one of our primary competitive advantages they are logistics experts and problem solvers and act as an extension of our customers teams our customers and contract carriers consistently cite our people and the strong value added relationships with our account teams as a primary reason they choose to work with us our innovative talent strategies support the development and empowerment of our people enabling the success of our customers and contract carriers and helping drive our growth strategy 

working with their regional or divisional leaders each team makes hiring decisions based on balancing business needs with personnel investment and meeting targeted productivity and profitability goals our continued success depends in large part on our ability to hire strong diverse talent and retain and develop successful employees our employee turnover ratio which is calculated as the number of employees who departed the company in the twelve months ended december 31 2020 divided by the average number of employees in the twelve months ended december 31 2020 was 18 percent on average our managers lead a team of six direct reports because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate talent acquisition team that develops a robust diverse pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from 

our employees go through onboarding that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive employees including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training and regular performance and career development reviews ongoing employee development is an important component of our talent strategy therefore our employees and managers have performance conversations on a regular basis at least twice per year in 2020 approximately 97 percent of our workforce received regular performance and career development reviews in addition on an annual basis we conduct an employee engagement survey to assess employee engagement which is measured by willingness to recommend a company intent to stay pride and the experience of intrinsic motivation on the job the 2020 survey indicated a positive engagement score of 81 percent which was consistent with benchmark companies 

table of content 

our marketcompetitive compensation programs help drive performance and reward success they include performancebased metrics and cash incentives directly tied to productivity the achievement of specific performance goals and the financial performance of the team or the organization overall a significant portion of management compensation is dependent on the growth and profitability of their team senior managers are paid a performancebased bonus which is measured based on balanced growth in top and bottom line performance of the team they represent for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their role and the overall success of the team 

a majority of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders refer to note 6 capital stock and stock award plans for further discussion related to equity award plan design 

employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of their team and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including management corporate sales and customer and carrier account management 

network employees 

we have defined job families and roles to enable our employees to specialize in particular areas of the business and build their expertise we believe this enables them to perform at a higher level and create more value for our customers and contract carriers some of our employees choose to stay in that area of specialization while others progress across multiple areas of the business to build a broader base of experience we believe our strategy of having multiple career path opportunities enables our employees to develop to their highest potential and choose a career plan that fits their goals and aspirations we also believe this drives higher engagement and retention 

depending on their role our employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs we have developed industry leading technology and complex proprietary pricing algorithms based on our information advantage that guide our employees regarding establishing competitive pricing with our customers and contracted motor carriers based on the unique characteristics of each customers shipment employees typically rely on expertise in other offices when contracting and executing truckload ltl ocean and air shipments multiple network offices often also work together to service larger global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one lead office on the account 

employees are generally specialized into roles on new customer sales opportunities account managing existing customer relationships managing contracted carriersupplier relationships for procuring capacity or ongoing service and operations of shipments customer sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets company marketing efforts and access to transportation industry shipment databases employees who are responsible for recruiting new motor carriers refer them to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration issued safety ratings and will enter into a contract for transportation services with ch robinson

the following are material factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this 10k we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public 

business environment and competition risk factors 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations currency fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

• decrease in volumes a reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth a significant portion of our freight are transactional or spot market opportunities the transactional market may be more impacted than the contractual freight market by overall economic conditions in addition if a downturn in our customers’ business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage retail manufacturing paper ecommerce or printing industries our operating results could be adversely affected 

• credit risk and working capital some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us and some may go out of business in addition some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past causing our working capital needs to increase 

• transportation provider failures a significant number of our contracted transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers 

• expense management we may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in addition we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand 

higher carrier prices may result in decreased adjusted gross profit margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our adjusted gross profit and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for over the road transportation services and changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase motor carrier pricing in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a loss 

changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our adjusted gross profit margins in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our adjusted gross profits fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased adjusted gross profit margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted motor carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our adjusted gross profit margin may also fluctuate adjusted gross profit margin is a nongaap financial measure calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues for additional information see item 7 of part ii management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including but not limited to shipment status information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

• equipment shortages in the transportation industry particularly among contracted motor carriers 

• changes in regulations impacting transportation 

• disruption in the supply or cost of fuel 

• reduction or deterioration in rail service and 

• unanticipated changes in freight markets 

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against traditional and nontraditional logistics companies including transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers technology matching services internet freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and ondemand transportation service providers we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our adjusted gross profit and income from operations in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a loss 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions including but not limited to flood drought freeze insects disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers’ ability to grow and harvest marketable crops 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season historically income from operations and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

company risk factors 

we rely on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain protect and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers

as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our operating systems in the past and may occur on our operating systems in the future previous attacks on our operating systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks we maintain a cyber liability insurance policy with coverage of 10 million to help protect us against losses that may result from a cyberrelated security breach or similar event the policy has a retention of 1 million per incident 

though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our operating systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

• changes in tariffs trade restrictions trade agreements and taxations 

• difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents 

• limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls 

• different liability standards and 

• intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property including but not limited to our proprietary information systems to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business through a network of offices throughout north america europe asia oceania and south america supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations personnel decisions and adherence to applicable local laws inconsistent management practices could materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenue and adjusted gross profit from our largest customers our top 100 customers comprise approximately 28 percent of our consolidated total revenue and 20 percent of consolidated adjusted gross profit our largest customer comprises approximately one percent of our consolidated total revenue the sudden loss of major customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

table of content 

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent annually longterm growth targets represent an over time perspective and do not necessarily represent an expected annual growth rate there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price 

governmental regulatory and legal risk factors 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the motor carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted motor carrier we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance we also require all contracted motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law most contracted motor carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements as well as cargo insurance in varying policy amounts railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier cargo loss or damage liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipme nt although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for motor carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them cl aims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a primary retention of 5 million per incident and also retention between 85 million and 90 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted motor carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

in north america as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international or domestic air shipments although we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers cargo from time to time claims may be asserted against us for cargo losses we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 155 million umbrella where we carry retentions between 2 million and 5 million and 85 million and 90 million per incident 

buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 155 million for product liability claims subject to a 500000 per incident deductible settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as associated consequential damages we carry product recall and contamination insurance coverage of 30 million this policy has a retention of 35 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

table of content 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the dot to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the fmc as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified iac providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the iata and federal regulations issued by the tsa we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the us customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the usda as required by paca we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate owned or leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

our contracted motor carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services 

changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could increase our borrowing costs we are also subject to risks related to uncertainty regarding libor a portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at variable interest rates primarily based on libor as of december 31 2020 we had no liborbased borrowings outstanding libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and the use of libor is expected to be discontinued after 2021 while we expect that reasonable alternatives to libor will be implemented prior to its discontinuation or that the target date for discontinuation may be extended we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments and they could include an increase in our interest expense 

general risk factors 

we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including 

• changes in political conditions and in governmental policies 

• changes in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations and 

• wars civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflicts 

table of content 

we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

in addition the company is monitoring the ongoing covid19 pandemic which has already caused a significant disruption to global financial markets and supply chains and has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses across the globe we have already experienced changes in demand including declines in certain industries and regions along with volatile pricing the significance of the operational and financial impact to our business will likely depend on how long and widespread this outbreak proves to be the extent to which covid19 impacts our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and the international actions that are being taken to contain and treat it while we currently expect this business disruption to be temporary there is uncertainty around the duration and its broader impact on the economy and therefore the effects it will have on our operations and financial results if economic or market conditions in key global markets deteriorate further we expect to continue experiencing material adverse effects on our business and results of operations and may experience material adverse effects on our financial positions

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations for some legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses however based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

market trends 

the north american surface transportation market experienced significant volatility in freight volumes and costs over the duration of 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic the impact on the market varied significantly depending on the severity of the restrictions in place to control the outbreak industry and customer size certain industries such as retail saw periods of elevated demand while other industries especially smaller customers in those industries experienced extended periods of demand and production well below historical levels industry freight volumes as measured by the cass freight index declined approximately eight percent in 2020 compared to 2019 which reflects the volatility resulting from the covid19 pandemic industry freight volumes compared to 2019 bottomed out in the second quarter of 2020 declining approximately 21 percent before showing growth of approximately four percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year 

the impact of reduced consumer demand and production in addition to driver shortages resulted in reduced carrier capacity most notably in truckload as many carriers either reduced lanes or exited the market entirely this reduced carrier capacity caused routing guides to rapidly degrade and more loads moved to the spot market driving sharp increases in transportation costs most significantly in the second half of 2020 one of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our managed services business routing guide depth is calculated as a simple average of all accepted shipments over all tender instances for any shipment facilitated by our managed services business the average routing guide depth was 14 in 2020 and increased steadily during the second half of 2020 to 18 in the fourth quarter of 2020 this compared to an average depth of tender of 12 during 2019 which is among the lowest levels we have experienced this decade 

the global forwarding market also experienced significant volatility resulting from the covid19 pandemic the air freight market experienced a significant decline in capacity due to a reduction in commercial flights from covid19 restrictions which resulted in sharp pricing increases the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the ocean freight market varied significantly over the course of 2020 depending on the severity of the outbreak in regions in which we operate many industries experienced temporary volume reductions and factory closures due to efforts to contain the spread of the virus which initially resulted in excess capacity and decreased pricing early in 2020 in the second half of 2020 most industries had resumed production and companies began to replenish low inventory levels amidst continued market uncertainty from the ongoing covid19 pandemic as demand accelerated it outpaced carrier capacity returning to the market which resulted in significant pricing increases for the cost of ocean freight 

business trends 

our 2020 surface transportation results were largely consistent with the overall market trends summarized above although we did experience volume increases in excess of the industry trends as measured by the cass freight index despite industry freight volumes declining approximately eight percent in 2020 our combined north american surface transportation “nast” truckload and ltl volumes increased approximately 55 percent the covid19 pandemic had a significant impact on our small business customers as our customer count decreased nearly 12 percent driven almost entirely by small and emerging market customers similarly the number of active contracted transportation companies we utilized declined approximately six percent solely with those carriers having a fleet under 100 trucks we continued to work with our customers to meet our contractual commitments while adapting our pricing to reflect the volatile cost of transportation pricing seen since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic while also serving customers needs in the spot market this resulted in an increase in average truckload linehaul rates per mile excluding fuel costs charged to customers although our truckload transportation costs excluding fuel prices increased at a faster rate resulting in adjusted gross profit margin compression 

our global forwarding results were largely consistent with the overall market trends summarized above throughout 2020 we augmented our air freight capacity with charter flights due to the significant capacity shortages in the market which resulted in larger than normal shipment sizes the increase in air freight pricing more than offset an 180 percent decline in air freight volumes ocean volumes increased a modest 05 percent in 2020 as volume reductions in the first half of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic were more than offset by increases in the second half of 2020 as industries resumed production and demand increased our ocean business experienced significant increases in the cost of ocean freight beginning in the second quarter as many ocean carriers idled capacity due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and this capacity was slow to return to the market in comparison to the demand and production increases experienced in the second half of 2020 these factors resulted in a rapidly increasing price and cost environment 

on march 2 2020 we acquired prime distribution services “prime distribution” or prime a leading provider of retail consolidation services in north america for 2227 million in cash the acquisition was effective as of february 29 2020 and therefore the results of operations of prime distribution have been included as part of the nast segment in our consolidated financial statements since march 1 2020 on february 28 2019 we acquired the space cargo group “space cargo” for the purpose of expanding our presence and capabilities in spain and colombia our consolidated results include the results of

significant developments 

our 2020 financial results and operations were impacted by the covid19 pandemic described above and discussed throughout item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in addition see part i—“item 1a risk factors” included within this annual report on form 10k for discussion of the impacts and potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our financial results and operations in 2021 and going forward will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including fluctuations in the severity of the outbreak and the actions being taken to contain and treat it 

during 2020 we have taken a variety of measures to ensure the availability continuity and security of our critical infrastructure ensure the health and safety of our employees around the globe and provide service and supply chain continuity to our customers and contracted carriers in order to deliver critical and essential goods and services we continue to follow public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of covid19 such as requiring social distancing wearing a mask and limiting the number of employees to less than 50 percent capacity when in the office in addition to the elimination of all nonessential travel we have also adopted workfromhome arrangements and near the end of 2020 approximately 84 percent of our employees were working remotely executing their duties and responsibilities in addition we took steps in 2020 to reduce costs including the elimination of all nonessential travel temporary salary reductions for company executive officers temporary reductions in cash retainers for board members temporary suspension of the company match to retirement plans for us and canadian employees accelerating the use of paid time off and furloughing approximately seven percent of our us and canadian employees in the second quarter of 2020 as we continued to harness the benefits of our technology investment and network transformation we eliminated certain positions during 2020 and therefore a portion of employees did not return from furlough we recognized 44 million in severance in 2020 as a result of these reductions 

due to the ongoing uncertainty around the severity and duration of the outbreak we are not able at this time to estimate the impact the covid19 pandemic may have on our financial results and operations in 2021 and going forward however the impact could be material in all business segments and could be material during any future period affected either directly or indirectly by this pandemic many businesses in particular small businesses continue to experience reduced production and output which could result in a decrease in freight volumes across a number of industries which may reduce our contractual and spot market opportunities in addition a significant number of our contracted carriers may reduce their capacity or charge higher prices in light of the volatile market conditions which may reduce our adjusted gross profit margins as we honor our contractual freight rates 

selected operating performance and other significant items 

the following summarizes select 2020 yearoveryear operating comparisons to 2019 

• total revenues increased 59 percent to 162 billion driven primarily by higher pricing in ocean and air freight services and contributions from the prime acquisition 

• gross profits decreased 70 percent to 24 billion adjusted gross profits decreased 67 percent to 24 billion primarily driven by lower adjusted gross profit margins in truckload services partially offset by contributions from the prime acquisition and higher adjusted gross profits in air freight and ocean services 

• personnel expenses decreased 43 percent to 12 billion driven primarily by cost savings initiatives including a 28 percent decrease in average headcount and a decline in benefits expenses and incentive compensation 

• selling general and administrative “sga” expenses decreased 03 percent to 4961 million primarily due to significantly lower travel expenses partially offset by the ongoing expenses from the prime acquisition 

• income from operations totaled 6733 million down 148 percent from last year due to a decline in adjusted gross profits adjusted operating margin of 279 percent decreased 260 basis points 

• interest and other expenses totaled 449 million which primarily consisted of 491 million of interest expense and was partially offset by a 33 million favorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses 

table of content 

• the effective tax rate for 2020 was 194 percent compared to 223 percent in 2019 the lower effective tax rate was due primarily to the tax benefit related to stockbased compensation including delivery of a onetime deferred stock award that was granted to the companys prior chief executive officer in 2000 and excess foreign tax credits 

• net income totaled 5064 million down 122 percent from a year ago diluted earnings per share eps decreased 112 percent to 372 

• cash flow from operations decreased 402 percent to 4992 million

consolidated results of operations—twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2019 

total revenues and related costs total transportation revenues increased driven by significant pricing increases in our ocean and air freight service lines and increased ltl volumes ocean pricing increased significantly in the second half of 2020 as improving demand outpaced carrier capacity returning to the market in addition a significant decline in capacity due to a reduction in commercial flights from covid19 restrictions resulted in sharp increases in air freight pricing these increases were partially offset by lower pricing in ltl and truckload services total purchased transportation and related services increased due to increased cost of transportation in most of our transportation services resulting from the factors discussed above 

our sourcing total revenues and purchased products sourced for resale increased due to higher pricing and costs per case which was partially offset by lower case volume most notably in the foodservice industry which has been significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

gross profits and adjusted gross profits our transportation adjusted gross profit decreased driven by adjusted gross profit margin declines in truckload services due to tight carrier capacity in the marketplace and the significant transportation cost volatility resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic relative to our contractual customer pricing we continued to meet our customer commitments despite increases for the cost of capacity which has resulted in adjusted gross profit margin compression partially offsetting these declines was an increase in air freight pricing resulting in adjusted gross profit margin expansion as we were able to leverage our contractual air freight capacity despite significant shortages in the air freight market sourcing adjusted gross profits declined driven by the costs of purchased products sourced for resale increasing at a faster rate than our sourcing total revenues in addition to lower case volumes 

operating exp enses personnel expenses decreased primarily due to cost savings initiatives including the temporary suspension of the company match to retirement plans for us and canadian employees declines in healthcare costs lower variable compensation and a decrease in average headcount other sga expenses decreased driven by the elimination of all nonessential travel partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in occupancy expenses including those attributable to acquisitions and an 115 million loss on the saleleaseback of a companyowned data center 

interest and other expense interest and other expense primarily consisted of 491 million of interest expense partially offset by a 33 million favorable impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses in 2020 this compared to a 42 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses in 2019 interest expense decreased from 2019 due to lower average borrowings and interest rates 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 194 percent in 2020 and 223 percent in 2019 the effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of sharebased payment awards including the tax benefit from the delivery of a onetime deferred stock award that was granted to the companys prior chief executive officer in 2000 and excess foreign tax credits these impacts were partially offset by state income taxes net of federal benefits and foreign income taxes the effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due to state income taxes net of federal benefit and foreign income taxes but was partially offset by the tax impact of excess foreign tax credits and sharebased payment awards

twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2019 

total revenues and related costs nast total revenues increased due to the acquisition of prime which added one percentage point to nast total revenues this increase was partially offset by declines in truckload total revenues driven by lower pricing in the first half of 2020 and significantly lower fuel prices in 2020 nast cost of transportation and related services increased driven by increased cost per mile in truckload services and was partially offset by significantly lower fuel prices 

gross profits and adjusted gross profits nast adjusted gross profits decreased driven primarily by lower adjusted gross profit per shipment in truckload and ltl services the lower adjusted gross profit per shipment in truckload was driven by the tight carrier capacity in the marketplace and the significant transportation cost volatility resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic relative to our contractual customer pricing we continued to meet our customer commitments despite increases for the cost of capacity which has resulted in adjusted gross profit margin compression our average truckload linehaul rate per mile charged to our customers which excludes fuel surcharges increased approximately 55 percent resulting from the market and business trends discussed above our truckload transportation costs excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 110 percent 

nast ltl adjusted gross profits decreased primarily due to reduced adjusted gross profit margins driven by the tight carrier capacity in the marketplace partially offset by increased volume the acquisition of prime distribution contributed five percentage points of ltl adjusted gross profit growth

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our organic growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock in addition we maintain the following debt facilities as described in note 4 financing arrangements dollars in thousands 



 

1 net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs 

we expect to use our current debt facilities and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 2438 million as of december 31 2020 and 4479 million as of december 31 2019 cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 2309 million as of december 31 2020 and 4051 million as of december 31 2019 working capital increased from 108 billion at december 31 2019 to 110 billion at december 31 2020 

table of content 

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities 

the following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents dollars in thousands 



cash flow from operating activities the decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital the unfavorable changes in working capital were primarily related to a sequential increase in accounts receivable associated with increasing pricing in a number of service lines during 2020 given the covid19 pandemic we are closely monitoring credit and collections activities to minimize risk as well as working with our customers to facilitate the movement of goods across their supply chains while also ensuring timely payment 

cash used for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures consisted primarily of investments in information technology which are intended to increase employee productivity automate interactions with our customers and contracted carriers and improve our internal workflows to help expand our adjusted operating margins and grow the business during 2019 we sold a facility we owned in chicago illinois for approximately 170 million 

in 2020 we used 2227 million for the acquisition of prime in 2019 we used 450 million for the acquisition of space cargo and 142 million for the acquisition of dema service 

we anticipate capital expenditures in 2021 to be approximately 55 million to 65 million 

cash used for financing activities we had net repayments on debt of 1430 million in 2020 and 1120 million in 2019 the 2020 and 2019 net repayments were primarily to reduce the outstanding balance of the receivables securitization facility the facility this facility expired in december 2020 and was not renewed there was no outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit agreement as of december 31 2020 and 2019 as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit agreement note purchase agreement and senior unsecured notes 

the decrease in cash dividends paid was the result of our fourth quarter dividend being paid on january 4 2021 the decrease in share repurchases in 2020 was due to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase activity near the end of the first quarter of 2020 as we assessed the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we resumed our repurchase activity in the fourth quarter of 2020 in may 2018 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2020 there were 7789752 shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential alternative uses of our cash and market conditions we may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes through open market cash purchases privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 

table of content 

although there is uncertainty related to the anticipated impact of the covid19 pandemic on our future results we believe that assuming no change in our current business plan our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facilities and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed 

recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note 14 recently issued accounting pronouncements  of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k we consider the following items in our consolidated financial statements to require significant estimation or judgment 

revenue recognition at contract inception we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify our performance obligations to provide distinct goods and services to our customers our transportation and logistics service arrangements often require management to use judgment and make estimates that impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 

transportation and logistics services  as a global logistics provider our primary performance obligation under our customer contracts is to utilize our relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies to efficiently and costeffectively transport our customers’ freight revenue is recognized for these performance obligations as they are satisfied over the contract term which generally represents the transit period the transit period can vary based upon the method of transport generally a number of days for over the road rail and air transportation or several weeks in the case of an ocean shipment 

recognizing revenue for contracts where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end requires management to make judgments that affect the amounts and timing of revenue recognized at period end at december 31 2020 we recorded revenue of 1972 million for services we have provided while a shipment was still intransit but for which we had not yet completed our performance obligation or had not yet invoiced our customer compared to 1329 million at december 31 2019 we utilize our historical knowledge of shipping lanes and estimated transit times to determine the transit period in cases where our customers’ freight has not reached its intended destination in addition we analyze contract data for the first few days following the reporting date combined with our historical experience of trends related to partially completed contracts as of the reporting date to determine our right to consideration for the services we have provided where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end differences in contract data for the first few days following the reporting date compared with our historical experience or disruptions such as weather events or other delays could cause the actual amount of revenue earned at period end to differ from these estimates 

total revenues represent the total dollar value of revenue recognized from contracts with customers for the goods and services we provide substantially all of our revenue is attributable to contracts with our customers most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to our customer and we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service additionally in our sourcing business in some cases we take inventory risk before the specified good has been transferred to our customer customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing managed procurement transactions are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present see also note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  for further information regarding our revenue recognition policies 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually on november 30 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value “step zero analysis” if the step zero analysis 

table of content 

indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value an additional impairment assessment is performed “step one analysis” as part of our step zero analysis we considered the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on financial markets and our business operations and determined that the more likely than not criteria had not been met and therefore a step one analysis was not required 

when we perform a step one analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

in the step one analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations when a step one analysis is performed 

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2020 dollars in thousands 



 

1 amounts payable relate to the semiannual interest due on the senior and longterm notes and the principal amount at maturity 

2 we maintain operating leases for office space warehouses office equipment and a small number of intermodal containers see note 11 leases  for further information 

3 purchase obligations include agreements for services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms as of december 31 2020 such obligations primarily include ocean and air freight capacity telecommunications services maintenance contracts and information technology related capacity in some instances our contractual commitments may be usage based or require estimates as to the timing of cash settlement 

we have no financing lease obligations longterm liabilities consist primarily of noncurrent taxes payable and longterm notes payable due to the uncertainty with respect to the amounts or timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2020 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 423 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes as of december 31 2020 we do not have significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we had 2438 million of cash and cash equivalents on december 31 2020 substantially all of the cash equivalents are in demand accounts with financial institutions the primary market risks associated with these investments are liquidity risks 

we are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a 1 billion revolving loan facility interest accrues on the revolving loan at a variable rate determined by a pricing schedule or the base rate which is the highest of a the administrative agents prime rate b the federal funds rate plus 050 percent or c the sum of onemonth libor plus a specified margin at december 31 2020 there was no outstanding balance on the revolving loan 

we are a party to the note purchase agreement as amended with various institutional investors with fixed rates consisting of i 175 million of the company’s 397 percent senior notes series a due august 27 2023 ii 150 million of the company’s 426 percent senior notes series b due august 27 2028 and iii 175 million of the company’s 46 percent senior notes series c due august 27 2033 at december 31 2020 there was 500 million outstanding on the notes 

we issued senior notes through a public offering on april 9 2018 the senior notes bear an annual interest rate of 42 percent payable semiannually on april 15 and october 15 until maturity on april 15 2028 taking into effect the amortization of the original issue discount and all underwriting and issuance expenses the senior notes have an effective yield to maturity of approximately 439 percent per annum the fair value of the senior notes excluding debt discounts and issuance costs approximated 7102 million as of december 31 2020 based primarily on the market prices quoted from external sources the carrying value of the senior notes was 5933 million at december 31 2020 

a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our debt facilities 

foreign exchange risk 

we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia oceania and south america as a result we frequently transact using currencies other than the us dollar primarily the chinese yuan euro canadian dollar and mexican peso this often results in assets and liabilities including intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency in these instances most commonly we have balances denominated in us dollars in regions where the us dollar is not the functional currency this results in foreign exchange risk 

foreign exchange risk can be quantified by performing a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact our primary foreign exchange risk is associated with balances denominated in us dollars held in china where the functional currency is the chinese yuan all other things being equal a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar against the chinese yuan on december 31 2020 would have decreased our net income by approximately 119 million and a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar against the chinese yuan on december 31 2020 would have increased our net income by approximately 97 million our use of derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risk is insignificant

overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with consolidated total revenues of 153 billion in 2019 we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2019 we handled approximately 18 million shipments and worked with more than 119000 customers we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia oceania and south america we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers we have two reportable segments north american surface transportation “nast” and global forwarding with our remaining operating segments reported under all other and corporate for financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions refer to note 9 segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 

as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and costeffectively arrange the transport of our customers’ freight we utilized approximately 78000 contracted transportation companies including contracted motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air and ocean carriers in 2019 depending on the needs of our customers and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate mode of transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible and provide solutions that optimize service for our customers as an integral part of our transportation services we may also provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation customs brokerage supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting 

in addition to transportation and logistics services we provide sourcing services under the trade name robinson fresh ® “robinson fresh” our sourcing services consist primarily of the buying selling andor marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other valueadded perishable items this was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through a network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and managed procurement services we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh and valueadded produce under recognized consumer brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers 

our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and we believe it has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our network of offices our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on profitability and their contributions to the success of the company we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing team productivity 

our network of offices work together to meet our customers’ needs and crosssell our services for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in global account centers or in one office and rely on multiple offices to deliver specific geographic or modal needs most of our global network operates on a single global technology platform called navisphere ® that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other offices and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally hiring additional employees and leveraging our technology we continually look to grow through selective acquisitions in february 2019 we acquired the space cargo group “space cargo” a provider of international freight forwarding customs brokerage and other logistics services to expand our offerings in spain and colombia space cargo operates in our global forwarding operating segment 

in january 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire prime distribution services a leading provider of retail consolidation services in north america for approximately 225 million in cash the agreement is subject to certain customary closing conditions including regulatory approval 

in may 2019 we acquired dema service spa “dema service” a provider of european road transportation to expand our offerings primarily in italy dema service operates in our european surface transportation operating segment 

in august 2017 we acquired milgram  company ltd “milgram” a provider of freight forwarding customs brokerage and surface transportation to strengthen our freight forwarding and customs brokerage offerings in canada milgram operates primarily in our global forwarding operating segment 

transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by investing in and retaining talented employees developing innovative proprietary systems and processes and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contracted motor carriers railroads and air and ocean carriers we make a profit driven by the value we provide our customers and the resulting difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics company 

we provide the following transportation and logistics services 

• truckload through our contracts with motor carriers we have access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity we connect our customers with contracted motor carriers who specialize in their transportation lanes and product types and we help contracted motor carriers optimize the usage of their equipment 

• less than truckload “ltl” ltl transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight we primarily focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger although we handle any size shipment through our contracts with motor carriers and use of navisphere we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight in many instances we will consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads 

• intermodal our intermodal transportation service is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers by a combination of truck and rail we have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america and we arrange local pickup and delivery known as drayage through local contracted motor carriers in addition we own approximately 1500 and lease approximately 1100 intermodal containers 

• ocean as a nonvessel ocean common carrier “nvocc” and freight forwarder we consolidate shipments determine routing select ocean carriers contract for ocean shipments andor provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments 

• air as a certified indirect air carrier “iac” and freight forwarder we organize air shipments and provide doortodoor service 

• customs our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by us customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies to assist importers and exporters in meeting legal requirements governing imports and exports 

• other logistics services we provide feebased managed services warehousing services small parcel and other services 

customers communicate their freight needs typically on an orderbyorder basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account the team ensures that all necessary information regarding each shipment is available in navisphere this information is received electronically by navisphere from the customers system entered by our employees into navisphere or by the customer through our web tools we utilize the information from navisphere and other available sources to select the best contracted carrier based upon factors such as their service score equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors 

once the contracted carrier is selected we receive the contracted carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation during the time when a shipment is executed we connect frequently either electronically or manually with the contracted carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer our services to the customer may be priced on a spot market or transactional basis or prearranged contractual rates most of our contractual rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements which allow for fuel to primarily act as a passthrough cost in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase most of our truckload services from our contracted truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contracted motor carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contracted motor carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

while providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a global basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we analyze customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

we have broadened our relationship with many of our customers through an emphasis on integrated logistics solutions resulting in us managing a greater portion of their supply chains we often serve our customers through specially created teams and through multiple locations our transportation and logistics services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network 

transportation services accounted for approximately 96 percent of net revenues in 2019 and 2018 respectively and 95 percent in 2017 net revenues are a nongaap financial measure calculated as total revenues less the total of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale for additional information see item 7 of part ii management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the years ended december 31 in thousands 



sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by our customers in many instances we consolidate an individual customer’s produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers 

our sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and nationally licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of high quality fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately four percent of our net revenues in 2019 and 2018 respectively and five percent in 2017   

organization 

segment information we have two reportable segments nast and global forwarding with our remaining operating segments reported as all other and corporate the all other and corporate segment includes robinson fresh managed services other surface transportation outside of north america and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses see additional disclosure in note 9 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements

other surface transportation revenues are primarily earned by our europe surface transportation operating segment europe surface transportation provides services similar to nast across europe 

office network to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia oceania and south america 

our employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs we have developed complex proprietary pricing algorithms that guide our employees regarding establishing competitive pricing with our customers and contracted motor carriers based on the unique characteristics of each customers shipment employees typically rely on expertise in other offices when contracting and executing truckload ltl intermodal ocean and air shipments multiple network offices often also work together to service larger global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” office on the account 

network employees employees are generally specialized into roles on new customer sales opportunities account managing existing customer relationships managing contracted carriersupplier relationships for procuring capacity or ongoing service and operations of shipments customer sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets company marketing efforts and 

access to transportation industry shipment databases employees who are responsible for recruiting new motor carriers refer them to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration “fmcsa” issued safety ratings and will enter into a contract for transportation services with ch robinson 

working with their regional or divisional leaders each team makes hiring and staffing decisions based on balancing business needs with personnel investment and meeting targeted productivity and profitability goals because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate talent acquisition team that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and may have some business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

our employees go through centralized onboarding that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive employees including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training 

compensation programs include performancebased metrics and cash incentives directly tied to productivity and performance a significant portion of network management compensation is dependent on the growth and profitability of their team they are paid a performancebased bonus which is measured based on balanced growth in top and bottom line performance of the team they represent for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their role and the overall success of the team 

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and may also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees 

employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of their team and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including management corporate sales and customer and carrier account management 

shared services our network offices are supported by our shared and centralized services approximately 12 percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers over 55 percent of these shared services employees are technology personnel who enhance and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our technology infrastructure 

customer relationships 

we work to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2019 we served over 119000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries 

during 2019 our largest customer accounted for approximately two percent of total revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines expertise and technology enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive and shared services teams offices are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet both ours and our customers’ service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and available capacity during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight so these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2019 we worked with approximately 78000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with contracted motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with contracted motor carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their 

empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contracted motor carriers to work with us we have a policy of contracted motor carrier invoice payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in accordance with our standard payment terms for those contracted motor carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer expedited payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity these contracted motor carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contracted motor carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2019 contracted motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 81 percent of our truckload shipments in 2019 every united states and canadian motor carrier with which we do business with is required to execute a contract that establishes that the motor carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and thereafter through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each united states contracted motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and can provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the contracted motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and typically the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a contracted motor carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1500 53foot containers and lease approximately 1100 containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

in our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional iac in the united states and internationally we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against many logistics companies including technologybased service companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services nvoccs iacs and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

• people smart dedicated empowered people act as an extension of our customers’ teams to innovate and execute their supply chain strategies 

• process proven processes and solutions combine strategy with practical experience for customized action plans that succeed in the real world 

• technology navisphere our proprietary technology provides flexibility global visibility customized solutions easy integration broad connectivity and advanced security

• scale our customers leverage our industryleading capacity broad procurement options and substantial shipment volumes for better efficiency service and marketplace advantages and 

• stability our financial strength discipline and consistent track record of success for strategic support of our customers’ supply chains 

seasonality 

our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends as a result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

proprietary information technology and intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of cyber security trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the united states and international locations 

our software systems are essential to service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2019 we executed approximately 18 million shipments for more than 119000 customers with more than 78000 contracted carriers 

our operational systems help our employees service customer orders select the optimal mode of transportation build and consolidate shipments identify appropriate carriers and manage exceptions all based on customerspecific service parameters our data estate provides our organization with the necessary business intelligence to allow for the necessary decision support in all areas of our business

the navisphere vision product allows our customers to see their freight across all modes and services globally in a single view details of shipment contents status of shipments based on milestones disruptions to shipments and resulting estimated time of arrival adjustment using artificial intelligence are provided for the customer to manage their supply chain exceptions collaboration intelligent notifications and performance score carding allow customers to manage their supply chain and identify inefficiencies

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we contractually require and rely on the motor carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted motor carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all contracted motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law most contracted motor carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier cargo loss or damage liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

in north america as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international or domestic air shipments with regards to international freight forwarding certain ocean transportation international domestic air freight shipments and nast ltl shipments we offer our customers the option to purchase shippers’ interest insurance coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations currency fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

• decrease in volumes a reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth a significant portion of our freight are transactional or “spot” market opportunities the transactional market may be more impacted than the contractual freight market by overall economic conditions in addition if a downturn in our customers’ business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage retail manufacturing paper ecommerce or printing industries our operating results could be adversely affected 

• credit risk and working capital some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us and some may go out of business in addition some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past causing our working capital needs to increase 

• transportation provider failures a significant number of our contracted transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers 

• expense management we may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in addition we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand 

higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for overtheroad transportation services and changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase motor carrier pricing in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a net revenue loss 

changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted motor carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our net revenue margin may also fluctuate 

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including but not limited to shipment status information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

• equipment shortages in the transportation industry particularly among contracted motor carriers 

• changes in regulations impacting transportation 

• disruption in the supply or cost of fuel 

• reduction or deterioration in rail service and 

• unanticipated changes in freight markets 

we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including 

• changes in political conditions and in governmental policies 

• changes in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations and 

• wars civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflicts 

we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

in addition the ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from china at the beginning of 2020 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region these or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in china or other countries in which we operate could adversely impact our operating results but at this point the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

• changes in tariffs trade restrictions trade agreements and taxations 

• difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents 

• limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls 

• different liability standards and 

• intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property including but not limited to our proprietary information systems to the same extent as the laws of the united states 

the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against traditional and nontraditional logistics companies including transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers technology matching services internet freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and ondemand transportation service providers we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a net revenue loss 

we rely on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain protect and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers 

as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our operating systems in the past and may occur on our operating systems in the future previous attacks on our operating systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks 

though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our operating systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business through a network of offices throughout north america europe asia oceania and south america supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations personnel decisions and adherence to applicable local laws inconsistent management practices could materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season historically income from operations and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the motor carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted motor carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for motor carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a primary retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to 

purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted motor carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions including but not limited to flood drought freeze insects disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers’ ability to grow and harvest marketable crops 

buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 200 million for product liability claims subject to a 500000 per incident deductible settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as associated consequential damages we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the dot to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the fmc as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified iac providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the iata and federal regulations issued by the tsa we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the us customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the usda as required by paca we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate owned or leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

our contracted motor carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers our top 100 customers comprise approximately 32 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 24 percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues the sudden loss of major customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent annually longterm growth targets represent an over time perspective and do not necessarily represent an expected annual growth rate there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price 

changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could increase our borrowing costs a substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on libor in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority “fca” a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the united kingdom stated that they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor interest rates indices the fca has indicated they will support the libor indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its recommended alternative to libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 sofr is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities 

we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate including the possibility of sofr as the dominant replacement introduction of an alternative rate also may introduce additional basis risk for market participants as an alternative index is utilized along with libor there can be no guarantee that sofr will become widely used and that alternatives may or may not be developed with additional complications we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021 whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations for some legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses however based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

our net revenues are a nongaap financial measure calculated as total revenues less the cost of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale we believe net revenues are a useful measure of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider net revenues to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations often focuses on the changes in our net revenues the reconciliation of total revenues to net revenues is presented below in thousands 



market trends 

the north america truckload market has faced significant cyclical changes in the last year attributable to weakening demand and excess capacity resulting in pricing and volume declines during the second half of 2019 one of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our managed services business routing guide depth represents the number of carriers contacted prior to an acceptance when procuring a transportation provider routing guide depth is calculated as a simple average of all accepted shipments over all tender instances for any shipment facilitated by our managed services business the average routing guide depth of tender was 12 during 2019 representing that on average the first carrier in a shippers routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases this compared to an average depth of tender of 17 during 2018 the 2019 routing guide penetration is among the lowest levels we have experienced this decade and is a reflection of both softening demand and reduced pricing and costs over the course of 2019 the global forwarding market was negatively impacted for much of 2019 by excess capacity and reduced demand due to tariff activity and macroeconomic uncertainty especially in trade lanes between china and the united states in addition growth rates were negatively impacted by comparisons to 2018 which included shipments to build inventory ahead of tariffs enacted in early 2019 this reduced demand has also significantly reduced air freight volumes as there is inherently less demand for expedited and more expensive air freight 

business trends 

our 2019 results are largely consistent with the overall market trends summarized above as a result of the softening freight environment over the course of 2019 our volumes shifted from spotmarket pricing towards contractual business in the first half of 2019 this shift resulted in margin expansion as contractual pricing decreased at a slower rate than spotmarket driven carrier costs in the second half of 2019 the continued shift to contractual business began to lead to margin compression as spotmarket driven carrier pricing declines began to decelerate as compared to our contractual pricing declines given the soft freight environment we continued to see competitive levels of pricing activity to reflect current market conditions which resulted in significant pricing declines in most of our transportation service lines compared to 2018 our pricing strategies continue to reflect the current market conditions and our intention to be near the top of our customers routing guide in 

addition the reduced pricing in truckload has resulted in a volume shift from intermodal to truckload while our sourcing revenues declined in 2019 driven by case volume declines with large retailers 

on february 28 2019 we acquired the space cargo group “space cargo” for the purpose of expanding our presence and capabilities in spain and colombia our consolidated results include the results of space cargo since march 1 2019 on may 22 2019 we acquired dema service spa “dema service” to strengthen our existing footprint in italy our consolidated results include the results of dema service since may 23 2019 

selected operating performance and other significant items

consolidated results of operations—twelve months ended december 31 2019 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2018 

total revenues and direct costs total transportation revenues decreased driven by lower pricing and volumes in truckload and to a lesser extent decreased intermodal volumes and decreased pricing in our ocean and air service lines total purchased transportation and related services decreased due to decreased cost of transportation in most of our transportation services resulting from softening market demand over the course of 2019 and excess carrier capacity our sourcing total revenues and purchased products sourced for resale decreased due to lower pricing and costs per case in addition to lower case volume 

net revenues our transportation net revenue margin increased driven by margin expansion in truckload services as we benefited from a shift to contractual volume in a falling cost market for the first half of 2019 the margin expansion in the first half of 2019 was largely offset by margin compression in the second half of 2019 as discussed above sourcing net revenue margin increased driven by the strategic decision to exit unprofitable business 

operating expenses personnel expenses decreased primarily due to declines in performancebased compensation partially offset by an increase in average headcount other sga expenses increased driven primarily by increases in purchased services particularly commercial offtheshelf software and occupancy partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 

interest and other expense interest and other expense increased driven by a 42 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses in 2019 compared to a 169 million favorable impact in 2018 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 223 percent and 245 percent the effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due to state income taxes net of federal benefit and foreign income taxes but was partially offset by the tax impact of excess foreign tax credits and sharebased payment awards the effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due to state income taxes net of federal benefit and foreign income taxes but was partially offset by the tax impact of sharebased payment awards 

consolidated results of operations—twelve months ended december 31 2018 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2017 

total revenues and direct costs total transportation revenues increased driven by increased pricing in most of our transportation services most notably truckload and ltl total purchased transportation and related services increased due to increased truckload and ltl purchased transportation costs and higher ocean volumes which were partially offset by the impact of decreased truckload volumes our sourcing total revenue and purchased products sourced for resale decreased 1205 million as a result of our adoption of asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  

net revenues our transportation net revenues increased primarily due to increases in customer pricing including fuel sourcing net revenues decreased due to decreases in net revenue per case and a case volume decrease across a variety of commodities and services most notably in our restaurant and food service customers sourcing net revenue margin increased 10 percentage point as a result of our adoption of asu 201409 

operating expenses personnel expenses increased primarily due to an increase in performancebased compensation due to our strong earnings growth and growth in our average headcount other sga expenses increased driven primarily by increases in occupancy and other professional services expenses claims and the provision for bad debt 

interest and other expense interest and other expense decreased driven by a 169 million favorable impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses in 2018 compared to a 94 million unfavorable impact in 2017 the impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains was partially offset by increased interest expense due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates in 2018 compared to 2017 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 245 percent in 2018 and 307 percent in 2017 driven primarily by an 831 million benefit from the tax act

global forwarding segment results of operations 



twelve months ended december 31 2019 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2018 

total revenues and direct costs total revenues and direct costs decreased driven by reduced pricing in our ocean and air service lines and a decline in air freight volumes these declines were driven by the tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty discussed above in addition to the comparisons to 2018 which included shipments to build inventory ahead of tariffs enacted in early 2019 the reduced demand due to tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty has also significantly impacted air freight volumes as there is inherently less demand for expedited and more expensive air freight 

net revenues ocean and air transportation net revenues decreased driven by reduced pricing and air freight volumes discussed above these declines were partially offset by the acquisition of space cargo which contributed two percentage points of ocean net revenue growth and five percentage points of air net revenue growth for the twelvemonth period of 2019 customs net revenues increased driven by increased volumes including a modest impact from space cargo 

operating expenses personnel expenses decreased driven by reduced performancebased compensation but was partially offset by an increase in average headcount driven by the space cargo acquisition sga expenses increased driven by increased investments in technology partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 

twelve months ended december 31 2018 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2017

robinson fresh net revenues decreased driven by reduced case volumes due to strategic decisions to exit unprofitable business managed services net revenues increased driven by a combination of new customer wins and selling additional services to existing customers other surface transportation net revenues increased primarily driven by the acquisition of dema service which contributed six percentage points of growth in other surface transportation 

twelve months ended december 31 2018 compared to twelve months ended december 31 2017 

total revenues decreased primarily due to a 1205 million decrease in sourcing total revenue and purchased products sourced for resale as a result of our adoption of asu 201409

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our organic growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock in addition we maintain the following debt facilities as described in note 4 financing arrangements dollars in thousands 



 

1 net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs 

we expect to use our current debt facilities and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 4479 million as of december 31 2019 and 3786 million as of december 31 2018 cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 4051 million as of december 31 2019 and 3200 million as of december 31 2018 working capital decreased from 13 billion at december 31 2018 to 11 billion at december 31 2019 

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities on january 28 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire prime distribution services a leading provider of retail consolidation services in north america for approximately 225 million in cash the agreement is subject to certain customary closing conditions including regulatory approval we anticipate financing the acquisition using cash and existing financing arrangements 

the following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents dollars in thousands 



cash flow from operating activities the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2019 from 2018 was primarily driven by improved working capital performance and the impact of decreasing total transportation revenues and purchased transportation on our accounts receivable and accounts payable balances the increase in cash flow from operations in 2018 from 2017 was primarily the result of increased earnings and improved working capital performance including improved collections of accounts receivable 

cash used for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures consisted primarily of investments in information technology which are intended to increase employee productivity automate interactions with our customers and contracted carriers and improve our internal workflows to help expand our operating margins and grow the business during 2019 we sold a facility we owned in chicago illinois for approximately 170 million 

in 2019 we used 450 million for the acquisition of space cargo and 142 million for the acquisition of dema service in 2017 we used 473 million for the acquisition of milgram 

we anticipate capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately 60 million to 70 million 

cash used for financing activities we had net repayments on debt of 1120 million in 2019 1190 million in 2018 and net borrowings of 2250 million in 2017 the 2019 net repayments were primarily to reduce the outstanding amount on the receivables securitization facility while the 2018 net repayments primarily related to the revolving credit facility partially offset by longterm borrowings on the senior notes the 2017 net borrowings were primarily related to the receivables securitization facility there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019 as of december 31 2018 the outstanding balance on the facility was 50 million as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with or have secured waivers of all of the covenants under the credit agreement note purchase agreement receivables securitization facility and senior notes 

the increases in cash dividends paid were the result of higher dividend rates partially offset by fewer outstanding shares the increase in share repurchases in 2019 was due to an increase in the number of shares repurchased partially offset by a decrease in the average price paid per share compared to 2018 in 2018 the increase in shares repurchased was due to an increase in the number of shares repurchased and an increase in the average price paid per share compared to 2017 in may 2018 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2019 there were 9993683 shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential alternative uses of our cash and market conditions 

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facilities and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed 

recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note 13 recently issued accounting pronouncements  of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k we consider the following items in our consolidated financial statements to require significant estimation or judgment 

revenue recognition at contract inception we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify our performance obligations to provide distinct goods and services to our customers our transportation and logistics service arrangements often require management to use judgment and make estimates that impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 

transportation and logistics services  as a third party logistics provider our primary performance obligation under our customer contracts is to utilize our relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies to efficiently and costeffectively transport our customers’ freight revenue is recognized for these performance obligations as they are satisfied over the contract term which generally represents the transit period the transit period can vary based upon the method of transport generally a number of days for over the road rail and air transportation or several weeks in the case of an ocean shipment 

recognizing revenue for contracts where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end requires management to make judgments that affect the amounts and timing of revenue recognized at december 31 2019 we recorded revenue of 1329 million for services we have provided while a shipment was still intransit but for which we had not yet completed our performance obligation or had not yet invoiced our customer we utilize our historical knowledge of shipping lanes and estimated transit times to determine the transit period in cases where our customers’ freight has not reached its intended destination in addition we analyze contract data for the first few days following the reporting date combined with our historical experience of trends related to partially completed contracts as of the reporting date to determine our right to consideration for the services we have provided where the transit period is partially complete or completed and not yet invoiced at period end disruptions such as weather events or other delays could cause the actual transit period to differ from these estimates 

total revenues represent the total dollar value of revenue recognized from contracts with customers for the goods and services we provide substantially all of our revenue is attributable to contracts with our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to our customer and we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service additionally in our sourcing business in some cases we take inventory risk before the specified good has been transferred to our customer customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing managed procurement transactions are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present see also note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  for further information regarding our revenue recognition policies 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually on november 30 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value “step zero analysis” if the step zero analysis indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value an additional impairment assessment is performed “step one analysis” based on our step zero analysis we determined that the more likely than not criteria had not been met and therefore a step one analysis was not required 

when we perform a step one analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

in the step one analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations when a step one analysis is performed 

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2019 dollars in thousands 



 

1 amounts payable relate to the semiannual interest due on the senior and longterm notes and the principal amount at maturity 

2 we maintain operating leases for office space warehouses office equipment and a small number of intermodal containers see note 11 leases  for further information 

3 purchase obligations include agreements for services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms as of december 31 2019 such obligations primarily include ocean and air freight capacity telecommunications services maintenance contracts and information technology related capacity in some instances our contractual commitments may be usage based or require estimates as to the timing of cash settlement 

we have no financing lease obligations longterm liabilities consist primarily of noncurrent income taxes payable and longterm notes payable due to the uncertainty with respect to the amounts or timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2019 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 399 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes as of december 31 2019 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we had 4479 million of cash and cash equivalents on december 31 2019 substantially all of the cash equivalents are in demand accounts with financial institutions the primary market risks associated with these investments are liquidity risks 

we are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a 1 billion revolving loan facility interest accrues on the revolving loan at a variable rate determined by a pricing schedule or the base rate which is the highest of a the administrative agents prime rate b the federal funds rate plus 050 percent or c the sum of onemonth libor plus a specified margin at december 31 2019 there was no outstanding balance on the revolving loan 

we are a party to the note purchase agreement as amended with various institutional investors with fixed rates consisting of i 175 million of the company’s 397 percent senior notes series a due august 27 2023 ii 150 million of the company’s 426 percent senior notes series b due august 27 2028 and iii 175 million of the company’s 46 percent senior notes series c due august 27 2033 at december 31 2019 there was 500 million outstanding on the notes 

we are a party to a receivables securitization facility as amended with various lenders that provides funding of up to 250 million interest accrues on the facility at variable rates based on 30day libor plus a margin at december 31 2019 there was 1429 million outstanding net of unamortized issuance costs on the securitization facility 

we issued senior notes through a public offering on april 9 2018 the senior notes bear an annual interest rate of 42 percent payable semiannually on april 15 and october 15 until maturity on april 15 2028 taking into effect the amortization of the original issue discount and all underwriting and issuance expenses the senior notes have an effective yield to maturity of approximately 439 percent per annum the fair value of the senior notes excluding debt discounts and issuance costs approximated 6599 million as of december 31 2019 based primarily on the market prices quoted from external sources the carrying value of the senior notes was 5924 million at december 31 2019 

a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our debt facilities 

foreign exchange risk 

we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia oceania and south america as a result we frequently transact using currencies other than the us dollar primarily the chinese yuan euro canadian dollar and mexican peso this often results in assets and liabilities including intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the functional currency in these instances most commonly we have balances denominated in us dollars in regions where the us dollar is not the functional currency this results in foreign exchange risk 

foreign exchange risk can be quantified by performing a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact our primary foreign exchange risk is associated with balances denominated in us dollars held in china where the functional currency is the chinese yuan all other things being equal a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar against the chinese yuan during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 would have decreased our income from operations by approximately 179 million and a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar against the chinese yuan during the twelve months ended december 31 2019 would have increased our income from operations by approximately 146 million our use of derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risk is insignificant

overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with consolidated total revenues of 166 billion  in 2018  we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2018  we handled approximately 18 million shipments and worked with more than 124000  customers we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia oceania and south america we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers we have three reportable segments north american surface transportation “nast” global forwarding and robinson fresh with our remaining operating segments reported as all other and corporate for financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions refer to note 9 segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 

as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and costeffectively arrange the transport of our customers’ freight we utilized approximately 76000  contracted transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air and ocean carriers in 2018 depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate mode of transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible and provide solutions that optimize service for our customers as an integral part of our transportation services we may also provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting 

in addition to transportation and logistics services we provide sourcing services under the trade name robinson fresh ®  “robinson fresh” our sourcing services consist primarily of the buying selling andor marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other valueadded perishable items this was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through a network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and managed procurement services we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh and valueadded produce under recognized consumer brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers 

our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our network of offices our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on profitability and their contributions to the success of the company we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity 

our network of offices work together to meet our customers’ needs and crosssell our services for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in global account centers or in one office and rely on multiple offices to deliver specific geographic or modal needs most of our global network operates on a single global technology platform called navisphere ®  that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other offices and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional employees we continually look to grow through selective acquisitions in august 2017 we acquired milgram  company ltd “milgram” a provider of freight forwarding customs brokerage and surface transportation primarily in canada the acquisition strengthens our freight forwarding and customs brokerage offerings in canada milgram operates primarily in our global forwarding segment 

  

in september 2016 we completed the acquisition of apc logistics “apc” a privately held company based in australia to expand our global presence and bring additional capabilities and expertise to our portfolio apc provides international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services in australia and new zealand apc operates in our global forwarding segment 

transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by investing in and retaining talented employees developing cutting edge proprietary systems and processes and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads and air and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics company 

we provide the following transportation and logistics services 

 customers communicate their freight needs typically on an orderbyorder basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account the team ensures that all necessary information about each shipment is available in navisphere this information is entered by our employees into navisphere by the customer through our web tools or received electronically by navisphere from the customers’ systems we utilize the information from navisphere and other available sources to select the best contracted carrier based upon factors such as their service score equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors 

once the contracted carrier is selected we receive the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation during the time when a shipment is executed we connect frequently with the contract carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the 

  

contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer our services to the customer may be priced on a spot market or transactional basis or prearranged contractual rates most of our contractual rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase most of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

while providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

we have broadened our relationship with many of our customers through an emphasis on integrated logistics solutions resulting in us managing a greater portion of their supply chains we often serve our customers through specially created teams and through multiple locations our transportation and logistics services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network 

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the years ended december 31 in thousands 

transportation services accounted for approximately 96 percent of net revenues in 2018  and 95 percent in 2017  and 2016  respectively net revenues are a nongaap financial measure calculated as total revenues less the total of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale for additional information see item 7 of part ii management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by our customers in many instances we consolidate an individual customer’s produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers 

  

our sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and nationally licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of high quality fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately four percent of our net revenues in 2018  and five percent in 2017  and 2016  respectively   

organization 

segment information we have three reportable segments nast global forwarding and robinson fresh with our remaining operating segments reported as all other and corporate the all other and corporate segment includes managed services other surface transportation outside of north america and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses see additional disclosure in note 9 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements 

nast provides freight transportation services across north america through a network of offices in the united states canada and mexico the primary services provided by nast include truckload ltl and intermodal 

global forwarding provides global logistics services through an international network of offices in north america europe asia oceania and south america and also contracts with independent agents worldwide the primary services provided by global forwarding include ocean freight services air freight services and customs brokerage 

robinson fresh provides sourcing services which primarily include the buying selling and marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other perishable items robinson fresh sources products from around the world this segment often provides the logistics and transportation of the products they buy sell or market in addition to temperature controlled transportation services for its customers 

all other and corporate primarily consists of managed services and other surface transportation outside of north america managed services is primarily comprised of our division tmc which offers managed tms ®  managed tms combines the use of navisphere logistics process expertise and consulting services in relation to the use of motor carriers chosen by our customers customers can access navisphere logistics experts and supply chain engineers to manage their daytoday operations and optimize supply chain performance 

other surface transportation revenues are primarily earned by our europe surface transportation operating segment europe surface transportation provides services like nast across europe 

office network  to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia oceania and south america 

each office is responsible for its own growth and profitability our employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs we have developed proprietary and complex pricing algorithms that guide our employees to establish competitive pricing to our customers and carriers based on the unique characteristics of each customers’ shipment employees typically rely on expertise in other offices when contracting and executing truckload ltl intermodal ocean and air shipments multiple network offices often also work together to service larger global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” office on the account 

network employees  employees are generally specialized into roles on new customer sales opportunities account managing existing customer relationships managing carriersupplier relationships for procuring capacity or ongoing service and operations of shipments sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets company marketing efforts and access to transportation industry shipment databases employees are also responsible for recruiting new motor carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration “fmcsa” issued safety ratings and will enter into a contract for transportation services with ch robinson 

each office is responsible for its hiring and staffing decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements subject to the office maintaining targeted productivity levels because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate talent acquisition team that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our 

  

applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

our employees go through centralized onboarding that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive employees including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training 

compensation programs are largely performancebased and cash incentives are directly tied to productivity and performance most network management compensation is dependent on the profitability of their office they are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the office’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the office 

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and may also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees 

employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual offices and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including management corporate sales and customer and carrier account management 

shared services our network offices are supported by our shared and centralized services approximately ten percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers over 50 percent of these shared services employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network 

customer relationships 

we work to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2018  we served over 124000  customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries 

during 2018  our largest customer accounted for approximately two  percent of total revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive and shared services teams offices are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our and our customers’ service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2018  we worked with approximately 76000  transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of contract carrier invoice payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than two  percent of our total cost of transportation in 2018  motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83  percent of our truckload shipments in 2018  every united states and canadian motor carrier with which we 

  

do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and thereafter through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each united states motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and can provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and typically the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1500 53foot containers and lease approximately 1100 containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

in our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional iac in the united states and internationally we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against many logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services nvoccs iacs and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 



  

 seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with income from operations and earnings lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

proprietary information technology and intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the united states and international locations 

our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2018  we executed approximately 18  million shipments for more than 124000  customers with more than 76000  contract carriers 

our systems help our employees service customer orders select the optimal mode of transportation build and consolidate shipments and identify appropriate carriers all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems provide our organization with the necessary business intelligence to allow for near real time scorecards and necessary decision support in all areas of our business 

our operations primarily use navisphere a single global platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with parties in their supply chain across languages currencies and continents navisphere offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands 

the navisphere vision webbased product allows our customers to see all of their freight across all modes and services globally in a single view details of shipment contents status of shipments based on milestones disruptions to shipments and resulting estimated time of arrival adjustment using artificial intelligence are provided for the customer to manage their supply chain exceptions collaboration intelligent notifications and performance scorecarding allow customers to manage their supply chain and identify inefficiencies 

the navisphere carrier webbased platform provides contracted carriers additional access to our systems contract carriers can access available freight perform online check calls keep track of receivables and upload scanned documentation many of our carriers’ favorite features from navisphere carrier are also available through our navisphere carrier mobile application available for android and ios mobile operating systems 

the navisphere driver mobile application provides contract carriers’ drivers with load status automation capabilities drivers can elect to allow the application to complete all stop updates and intransit calls drivers can also capture and upload bill of lading documentation to initiate payment processes the track and trace capabilities give our systems and customers frequent load status information 

government regulation 

our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission “fmc” as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified iac providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association “iata” and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration “tsa” we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

  

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we contractually require and rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture “usda” as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of other us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and other similar antibribery and anticorruption statutes 

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law most contracted carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier cargo loss or damage liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

in north america as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international or domestic air shipments with regards to international freight forwarding ocean transportation international domestic air freight shipments and shipments transacted by freightquote we offer our customers the option to purchase shippers’ interest coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 200 million  umbrella our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident 

as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims the deductible on our general liability coverage is 500000  per incident in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which were generally not insured we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million  this policy has a retention of 5 million  per incident 

we maintain a cyber liability insurance policy with coverage of 10 million  to help protect us against losses that may result from a cyberrelated security breach or similar event this policy has a retention of 10 million  per incident

risk factors 

tableend

the following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this 10k we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations currency fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin  carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a net revenue loss 

changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins  in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our net revenue margin may also fluctuate 

  

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services  we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions  our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including 

 we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks  we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 

the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

  

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model  our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition  competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against traditional and nontraditional logistics companies including transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers technology matching services internet freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and ondemand transportation service providers we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a net revenue loss 

we rely on technology to operate our business  we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers 

as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks 

though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices  we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout north america europe asia oceania and south america supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our offices operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry  results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season historically income from operations and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

  

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations  we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought freeze insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers’ ability to grow and harvest marketable crops 

buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 200 million  for product liability claims subject to a 500000  per incident deductible settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million  this policy has a retention of 5 million  per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the dot to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the fmc as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified iac providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the iata and federal regulations issued by the tsa we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection and other authoritative governmental agencies we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the usda as required by paca we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

  

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

our contract carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers  our top 100 customers comprise approximately 33  percent of our consolidated total revenues and 23  percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately two  percent of our consolidated total revenues the sudden loss of many of our major customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent longterm growth targets represent an over time perspective and do not necessarily represent an expected annual growth rate there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price 

  

changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could increase our borrowing costs a substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on libor in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority “fca” a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the united kingdom stated that they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor interest rates indices the fca has indicated they will support the libor indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as its recommended alternative to libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 sofr is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities 

we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate including the possibility of sofr as the dominant replacement the market transition away from libor and towards sofr is expected to be gradual and complicated including the development of term and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between libor and sofr introduction of an alternative rate also may introduce additional basis risk for market participants as an alternative index is utilized along with libor there can be no guarantee that sofr will become widely used and that alternatives may or may not be developed with additional complications we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021 whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations for some legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses however based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

overview 

our consolidated total revenues increased   118 percent  to 166 billion  in 2018  from 149 billion  in 2017  due to an increase  in transportation revenues driven by increased pricing in most of our transportation services most notably truckload and ltl this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sourcing total revenues of 1205 million  as a result of our adoption of asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  we achieved record levels of net revenues and income from operations driven by the strong performance of our nast reportable segment net revenues is a nongaap financial measure defined below net revenues increased 142 percent  to 27 billion  in 2018  from 24 billion  in 2017  income from operations increased   177 percent  to 9121 million  in 2018  from 7751 million  in 2017  our cash flow from operations increased 1065 percent  to 7929 million  in 2018  from 3840 million  in 2017  driven by the growth in income from operations and improved working capital performance the effective tax rate for 2018  was 245 percent  compared to 307 percent  in 2017  driven primarily by an 831 million  benefit from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” diluted net income per share increased   325 percent  to 473  in 2018  from 357  in 2017

our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers the following table summarizes our total revenues dollars in thousands 



net revenues are a nongaap financial measure calculated as total revenues less the total of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale we believe net revenues are a useful measure of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider net revenues to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations often focuses on the change in our net revenues the reconciliation of total revenues to net revenues is presented below in thousands

net revenues total transportation net revenues increased   155 percent  in 2018  to 26 billion  from 22 billion  in 2017  our transportation net revenue margin increased  slightly to 167 percent  in 2018  from 166 percent  in 2017  this slight increase  was driven by increases in customer pricing including fuel total sourcing net revenues decreased   89 percent  to 1115 million  in 2018  from 1224 million  in 2017  this decrease  was primarily due to decreases in net revenue per case and a case volume decrease across a variety of commodities and services most notably in our restaurant and foodservice customers sourcing net revenue margin increased  to 100 percent  in 2018  from 90 percent  in 2017  driven by the impact of our adoption of asu 201409 

operating expenses  operating expenses consist of personnel and selling general and administrative expenses operating expenses increased   126 percent  to 18 billion  in 2018  from 16 billion  in 2017  this was due to an increase  of 139 percent  in personnel expenses and an increase  of 88 percent  in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses decreased  to 663 percent  in 2018  from 673 percent  in 2017  

our personnel expenses are driven primarily by earnings growth and headcount in 2018  personnel expenses increased   139 percent  to 13 billion  from 12 billion  in 2017  personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased in 2018  to 497 percent  from 498 percent  in 2017  the increase  in personnel expense was due primarily to an increase in variable compensation due to our strong earnings growth and growth in our average headcount of 35 percent  in 2018  compared to 2017  

other selling general and administrative expenses increased   88 percent  to 4496 million  in 2018  from 4134 million  in 2017  this increase  in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in occupancy and other professional services expenses claims and the provision for bad debt

interest and other expenses  interest and other expenses were 318 million  in 2018  compared to 467 million  in 2017  the decrease was primarily due to a 169 million  favorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains in 2018  compared to a 94 million  unfavorable impact in 2017  the impact of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains was partially offset by increased interest expense due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates in 2018  compared to 2017  

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 245 percent  for 2018  and 307 percent  for 2017  driven primarily by an 831 million  benefit from the tax act

other selling general and administrative expenses increased 102 percent to 4134 million in 2017 from 3751 million in 2016 this increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in acquisition amortization warehousing and occupancy expenses and the provision for bad debt partially offset by a decrease in travel expenses and claims

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 307 percent for 2017 and 368 percent for 2016 during the fourth quarter of 2017 the provision for income taxes decreased by 197 million due to the benefit of deductions under section 199 of the internal revenue code and 121 million due to the impact of the tax act which was signed into law on december 22 2017 the 121 million benefit resulting from the tax act was primarily the result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and was partially offset by the impact of certain transition taxes and other impacts of the tax act 

during the first quarter of 2017 we adopted asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 the adoption of asu 201609 prospectively impacts the recording of income taxes related to sharebased payment awards in our consolidated financial position and results of operations as well as the operating and financing cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows this adoption resulted in a net tax benefit of 137 million during the year

liquidity and capital resources

1 net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs 

we also expect to use the revolving credit facility and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 3786 million  and 3339 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 3200 million  and 2753 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  working capital at december 31 2018  was 13 billion  working capital at december 31 2017  was 5235 million  

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities 

cash flow from operating activities  we generated 7929 million  3840 million  and 5294 million  of cash flow from operations in 2018  2017  and 2016  the increase of 4089 million  in cash flow from operations in 2018  from 2017  is primarily the result of increased earnings and improved working capital performance including improved collections of accounts receivable the decrease of 1454 million  in cash flow from operations in 2017  from 2016  is primarily the result of increased working capital driven by the impact of increased volumes and an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable balance

we anticipate capital expenditures in 2019 to be approximately 80 to 90 million

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed 

recently issued accounting pronouncements  refer to note 12 recently issued accounting pronouncements  of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k we consider the following items in our consolidated financial statements to require significant estimation or judgment 

  

revenue recognition at contract inception we assess the goods and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify our performance obligations to provide distinct goods and services to our customers our transportation and logistics service arrangements often require management to use judgment and make estimates that impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 

transportation and logistics services  as a third party logistics provider our primary performance obligation under our customer contracts is to utilize our relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies to efficiently and costeffectively transport our customers’ freight revenue is recognized for these performance obligations as they are satisfied over the contract term which generally represents the transit period the transit period can vary based upon the method of transport generally a couple days for over the road rail and air transportation or several weeks in the case of an ocean shipment determining the transit period and how much of it has been completed as of the reporting date may require management to make judgments that affect the timing of revenue recognized we utilize our historical knowledge of shipping lanes and estimated transit times to determine the transit period in cases where our customers’ freight has not reached its intended destination as of the reporting date disruptions such as weather events or other delays could cause the actual transit period to differ from these estimates 

total revenues represent the total dollar value of revenue recognized from contracts with customers for the goods and services we provide substantially all of our revenue is attributable to contracts with our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service to our customer and we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service additionally in our sourcing business in some cases we take inventory risk before the specified good has been transferred to our customer customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing managed procurement transactions are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present see also note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  for further information regarding our revenue recognition policies 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually on november 30 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value “step zero analysis” if the step zero analysis indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value an additional impairment assessment is performed “step 1 analysis” based on our step zero analysis we determined that the more likely than not criteria had not been met and therefore a step 1 analysis was not required 

  

when we perform a step 1 analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

  

in the step 1 analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations when a step 1 analysis is performed

a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments

we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia oceania and south america as a result we frequently transact using currencies other than the us dollar primarily the chinese yuan euro canadian dollar and mexican peso this often results in assets and liabilities including intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the local functional currency in these instances most commonly we have balances denominated in us dollars in regions where the us dollar is not the functional currency this results in foreign exchange risk 

foreign exchange risk can be quantified by performing a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar compared to other currencies in which we transact all other things being equal a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the us dollar during the twelve months ended december 31 2018  would have a decrease to income from operations of approximately 32 million  and a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the us dollar during the twelve months ended december 31 2018  would have an increase to income from operations of approximately 26 million  our use of derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risk is insignificant

overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with consolidated total revenues of 149 billion  in 2017  we are a service company we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2017  we handled approximately 19 million shipments and worked with more than 120000  customers we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers we have three reportable segments north american surface transportation “nast” global forwarding and robinson fresh with our remaining operating segments reported as all other and corporate for financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements 

as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and costeffectively arrange the transport of our customers’ freight we utilized approximately 73000  contracted transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air and ocean carriers in 2017 depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible and provide solutions that optimize service for our customers as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting 

in addition to transportation we provide sourcing services under the trade name robinson fresh ®  “robinson fresh” our sourcing services consist primarily of the buying selling andor marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other valueadded perishable items it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through a network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and managed procurement services we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh and valueadded produce under recognized consumer brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers 

our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our network of offices our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on profitability and their contributions to the success of the company we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity 

our network of offices work together to meet our customers’ needs and crosssell our services for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in global account centers or in one office and rely on multiple offices to deliver specific geographic or modal needs the majority of our global network operates on a single global technology platform called navisphere ®  that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other offices and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional employees we continually look to grow through selective acquisitions in august 2017 we acquired milgram  company ltd “milgram” a provider of freight forwarding customs brokerage and surface transportation primarily in canada the acquisition strengthens our freight forwarding and customs brokerage offerings in canada milgram operates primarily in our global forwarding segment 

in september 2016 we completed the acquisition of apc logistics “apc” a privately held company based in australia for the purpose of expanding our global presence and bringing additional capabilities and expertise to our portfolio apc provides international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services in australia and new zealand apc operates in our global forwarding segment 

on january 1 2015 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of freightquotecom inc “freightquote” for the purpose of enhancing our less than truckload “ltl” and truckload businesses and expanding our ecommerce capabilities freightquote operates in our nast segment 

net revenues are a nongaap financial measure calculated as total revenues less the cost of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale we believe net revenues are a useful measure of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider net revenues to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues the reconciliation of total revenues to net revenues is presented below in thousands 



transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and processes and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads and air and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics company 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 



 customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account the team ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system this information is entered by our employees by the customer through our web tools or received electronically from the customers’ systems we utilize the information from our operating system and other available sources to select the best available carrier based upon factors such as their service score equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors 

once the contracted carrier is selected we receive the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation during the time when a shipment is executed we connect frequently with the contract carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several locations our transportation services are provided to numerous international 

customers through our worldwide network see note 9 to our 2017  consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for disclosure of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  and our longlived assets as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the years ended december 31 in thousands 

transportation services accounted for approximately 95 percent of net revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 for additional information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of part ii of this report 

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by our customers in many instances we consolidate individual customer’s produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers 

our sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of high quality fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately five percent of our net revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015   

organization 

segment information we have continued to expand our services and diversify our business and have also made changes to align executive oversight to the business we have three reportable segments nast global forwarding and robinson fresh with our remaining operating segments reported as all other and corporate the all other and corporate segment includes managed services other surface transportation outside of north america and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses see additional disclosure in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements 

nast provides freight transportation services across north america through a network of offices in the united states canada and mexico the primary services provided by nast include truckload ltl and intermodal 

global forwarding provides global logistics services through an international network of offices in north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america and also contracts with independent agents worldwide the primary services provided by global forwarding include ocean freight services air freight services and customs brokerage 

robinson fresh provides sourcing under the trade name robinson fresh our sourcing services primarily include the buying selling and marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other perishable items robinson fresh sources products from around the world this segment often provides the logistics and transportation of the products they sell in addition to temperature controlled transportation services for its customers 

all other and corporate primarily consists of managed services and other surface transportation outside of north america managed services is primarily comprised of our division tmc which offers managed tms ®  managed tms combines a global transportation management system “tms” logistics process expertise and consulting services customers can access navisphere technology logistics experts and supply chain engineers to manage their daytoday operations and optimize supply chain performance 

other surface transportation revenues are primarily earned by our europe surface transportation operating segment europe surface transportation provides services similar to nast across europe 

office network  to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america 

each office is responsible for its own growth and profitability our employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the local level and offices cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation employees often rely on expertise in other offices when contracting ltl intermodal ocean and air shipments multiple network offices often also work together to service larger global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” office on the account 

network employees  employees both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts employees are also responsible for recruiting new motor carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration “fmcsa” issued safety ratings and will enter into a contract for transportation services with ch robinson 

each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate talent acquisition team that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

our employees go through centralized onboarding that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive employees including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training we expect most new employees to start contributing in a matter of weeks 

compensation programs are performancebased and cash incentives are directly tied to productivity and performance most network management compensation is dependent on the profitability of their particular office they are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the office’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the office 

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and may also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees 

employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual offices and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including management corporate sales and customer and carrier account management 

shared services our network offices are supported by our shared and centralized services approximately ten percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers approximately 50 percent of these shared services employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network

as of december 31 2017  we had a total of 15074  employees approximately 13700 of whom were located in our network offices our remaining employees centrally serve our network of offices in areas such as finance information technology legal marketing and human resources 

customer relationships 

we work to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2017  we served over 120000  customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries 

during 2017  our largest customer accounted for approximately two  percent of total revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive and shared services teams offices are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2017  we worked with approximately 73000  transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with 

carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than two  percent of our total cost of transportation in 2017  motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82  percent of our truckload shipments in 2017  every united states and canadian motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and thereafter through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each united states motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1500 53foot containers and lease approximately 1700 containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

in our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional iac in the united states and internationally we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services nvoccs iacs and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 



 seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with operating income and earnings lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future our results did not follow this pattern in 2017 due primarily to changing transportation costs and customer pricing during the second half of the year 

proprietary information technology and intellectual property 

we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the united states and international locations 

our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2017  we executed approximately 19  million shipments for more than 120000  customers with more than 73000  contract carriers 

our systems help our employees service customer orders select the optimal mode of transportation build and consolidate shipments and identify appropriate carriers all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems provide our organization with the necessary business intelligence to allow for near real time scorecards and necessary decision support in all areas of our business 

our operations primarily use navisphere a single global platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with parties in their supply chain across languages currencies and continents navisphere offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international or domestic air shipments with regards to international freight forwarding ocean transportation international domestic air freight shipments and shipments transacted by freightquote we offer our customers the option to purchase shippers’ interest coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage

risk factors 

tableend

the following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this 10k we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin  carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a revenue loss 

changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins  in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our net revenue margin may also fluctuate 

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services  we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions  our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including 

 we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks  we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 

the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model  our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition  competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against traditional and nontraditional logistics companies including transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers technology matching services internet freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and ondemand transportation service providers we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a revenue loss 

we rely on technology to operate our business  we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers 

as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks 

though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices  we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our offices operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry  results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season historically operating income and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future our results did not follow this pattern in 2017 due primarily to changing transportation costs and customer pricing in the second half of the year 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations  we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers’ ability to grow and harvest marketable crops 

buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims subject to a 250000 per incident deductible settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the dot to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified iac providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

our contract carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers  our top 100 customers comprise approximately 35  percent of our consolidated total revenues and 23  percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately two  percent of our consolidated total revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent longterm growth targets represent an over time perspective and do not necessarily represent an expected annual growth rate there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

we are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations for some legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses however based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview 

our company  we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of offices in north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 73000  active transportation companies in 2017 including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible and provide solutions that optimize service for our customers 

in addition to transportation and logistics services we also provide sourcing services our sourcing business consists of buying selling and marketing fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies transportation revenues generated by robinson fresh are included in our transportation service line in the first two tables below but are included in robinson fresh in the segment revenue table below 

our reportable segments are north american surface transportation “nast” global forwarding robinson fresh and all other and corporate the all other and corporate segment includes managed services other surface transportation outside of north america and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses we group offices primarily by services they provide for financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements 

our business model  we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply 

in 2017 changing market conditions continued to impact our results we had volume increases in all of our service lines and experienced pricing and cost increases in nearly all of our service lines which negatively impacted our margins truckload margin compression was a challenge to our earnings per share during much of the year in august 2017 we acquired milgram  company ltd “milgram” a provider of freight forwarding customs brokerage and surface transportation primarily in canada milgram operates primarily in our global forwarding segment 

in 2016 changing market conditions impacted our results we had volume increases in nearly all of our service lines but also experienced pricing declines which impacted our net revenue margins truckload margin compression was a challenge to our earnings per share during the second half of the year in september 2016 we completed the acquisition of apc logistics “apc” a privately held company based in australia for the purpose of expanding our global presence and bringing additional capabilities and expertise to our portfolio apc provides international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services in australia and new zealand apc operates in our global forwarding segment 

fuel prices declined throughout 2015 which contributed to slower growth of our total revenues and an increase in our transportation net revenue margins in 2015 we completed the acquisition of freightquotecom inc “freightquote” a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our ltl and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities freightquote operates in our nast segment 

we keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is tied to productivity and performance each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business 

our office network our office network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our network of offices helps us penetrate local markets provides facetoface service when needed and enables us to recruit contract carriers our network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic 

our people  because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount increased by 949 employees during 2017  which includes approximately 325 employees added as a result of the milgram acquisition compensation programs are performancebased and cash incentives are directly tied to productivity and performance most network management compensation is dependent on the profitability of their particular office we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders 

our customers  in 2017  we worked with more than 120000  customers we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated in 2017  our top 100 customers represented approximately 35  percent of our total revenues and approximately 23  percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately two  percent of our total revenues 

our contracted carriers  our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2017  we worked with approximately 73000  transportation providers worldwide up from approximately 71000 in 2016  motor carriers with fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82  percent of our truckload shipments in 2017  in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two  percent of our contracted carrier capacity

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition  total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable  our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 424 million  as of december 31 2017  increased compared to the allowance of 395 million  as of december 31 2016  this increase was primarily due to growth in the balance and deterioration of the aging of our accounts receivable portfolio we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested for impairment annually on november 30 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value “step zero analysis” if the step zero analysis indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying value an additional impairment assessment is performed “step 1 analysis” based on our step zero analysis we determined that the more likely than not criteria had not been met and therefore a step 1 analysis was not required 

  

when we perform a step 1 analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we have early adopted accounting standards update 201704 intangibles–goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which eliminates the need for further testing after the step 1 analysis 

  

in the step 1 analysis the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations when a step 1 analysis is performed 

  

stockbased compensation  we issue stock awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units to key employees and outside directors in general the awards vest over five years either based on the company’s earnings growth or the passage of time the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 15 percent  to 21 percent  and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2017  dollars in thousands 



 

 we have no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable longterm notes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2017  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 386 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2017  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2016  consolidated total revenues of  131 billion  we are a service company we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2016  we handled approximately 180 million shipments and worked with more than 113000  active customers we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers we have three reportable segments north american surface transportation “nast” global forwarding and robinson fresh with our remaining operating segments reported as all other and corporate for financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions refer to note 10 of our consolidated financial statements 

as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and costeffectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 107000  transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting our transportation services are primarily provided through our nast and global forwarding reportable segments 

in addition to transportation we provide sourcing services under the trade name robinson fresh ®  “robinson fresh” our sourcing services consist primarily of the buying selling andor marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other valueadded perishable items it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through our network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and managed procurement services we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh and valueadded produce under recognized consumer brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through our preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers 

our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our network of offices our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability and their contributions to the success of the company we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity 

our network offices work together to meet our customers’ needs and crosssell our services for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in global account centers or in one office and rely on multiple offices to deliver specific geographic or modal needs the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other offices and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional employees we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in september 2016 we completed the acquisition of apc logistics “apc” a privately held company based in australia for the purpose of expanding our global presence and bringing additional capabilities and expertise to our portfolio apc provides international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services in australia and new zealand apc operates in our global forwarding segment 

our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we sell our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and processes and utilizing our network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads air freight and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics company 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 

 customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account the team ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system this information is entered by our employees by the customer through our web tools or received electronically from the customers’ systems we utilize the information from our operating system and other available sources to select the best available carrier based upon factors such as their service score equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors 

once the contracted carrier is selected we receive the contract carriers’ commitment to provide the transportation during the time when a shipment is executed we connect continuously with the contract carrier to track the status of the shipment and assure that the unique needs of each of our customers is satisfied 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either 

contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several locations our transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network see note 10 to our 2016  consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for disclosure of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  and our longlived assets as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the years ended december 31 in thousands 

  

1 prior to 2015 we reported revenues from the fees we earn from our cash advance option offered to our contract carriers separately from transportation revenues starting in the first quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis we are reporting these payment services revenues as a part of transportation total and net revenues 

transportation services accounted for approximately 95 percent of net revenues in 2016 and 2015 and 94 percent of our net revenues in 2014 the increase in ltl in 2015 was primarily due to the acquisition of freightquotecom inc “freightquote” on january 1 2015 the increases in ocean air and customs revenues in 2013 were primarily related to our acquisition of 

phoenix international freight services ltd “phoenix” on november 1 2012 for additional information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of part ii of this report 

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers 

our sourcing services include forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of high quality fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately five percent of our net revenues in 2016 and 2015 and six percent of our net revenues in 2014   

organization 

segment information  we have continued to expand our services and diversify our business and have also made changes to align executive oversight to the business in late 2016 we made changes to our internal financial information that we use to make decisions including the allocation of all shared costs to the business segments beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016 based on these changes and to align with our current management reporting structure we concluded that we had three reportable segments nast global forwarding and robinson fresh with our remaining operating segments reported as all other and corporate the all other and corporate segment includes managed services other surface transportation outside of north america and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses we group offices primarily by services they provide see additional disclosure in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

the nast segment provides freight transportation services across north america through a network offices in the united states canada and mexico the primary services provided by nast include truckload ltl and intermodal 

the global forwarding segment provides global logistics services through an international network of offices in north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america and also contracts with independent agents worldwide the primary services provided by global forwarding include ocean freight services air freight services and customs brokerage 

the robinson fresh segment provides sourcing under the trade name robinson fresh our sourcing services primarily include the buying selling and marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other perishable items robinson fresh sources products from around the world and has a physical presence in north america europe asia and south america this segment often provides the logistics and transportation of the products they sell in addition to temperature controlled transportation services for its customers 

our all other and corporate segment primarily consists of managed services and other surface transportation outside of north america managed services is primarily comprised of our division tmc which offers managed tms ®  managed tms combines a global transportation management system “tms” logistics process expertise and consulting services customers can access cloudbased technology logistics experts and supply chain engineers to manage their daytoday operations and optimize supply chain performance 

other surface transportation revenues are primarily earned by our europe surface transportation operating segment europe surface transportation provides services similar to nast across europe 

office network  to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america 

each office is responsible for its own growth and profitability our employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the local level and offices cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation employees often rely on expertise in other offices when contracting ltl intermodal ocean and air shipments multiple network offices often also work together to service larger global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” office on the account 

network employees  employees both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts employees are also responsible for recruiting new motor carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration “fmcsa” issued safety ratings and will enter into a contract for transportation services with ch robinson 

each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate talent acquisition team that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

our employees go through centralized onboarding that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive employees including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training we expect most new employees to start contributing in a matter of weeks 

compensation programs are performancebased and cash incentives are directly tied to productivity and performance most network management compensation is dependent on the profitability of their particular office they are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the office’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the office within our 401k plan employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors 

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and may also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees 

employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual offices and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including management corporate sales and customer and carrier account management 

shared services our network offices are supported by our shared and centralized services approximately ten percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers approximately 50 percent of these shared services employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network

in 2016 we continued to expand our corporate sales account management and marketing support to enhance sales capabilities our executives and our corporate sales staff support our offices in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2016  we worked with approximately 71000  transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than 16  percent of our total cost of transportation in 2016  motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 81  percent of our truckload shipments in 2016  every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and thereafter through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1000 53foot containers and lease approximately 800 containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

in our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional indirect air carrier “iac” internationally and in north america we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services nvoccs iacs and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with operating income and earnings lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future our results did not follow this pattern in 2016 as we experienced pricing declines throughout the year 

proprietary information technology and intellectual property 

our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2016  we executed approximately 180  million shipments for more than 113000  active customers with more than 71000  contract carriers 

we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the united states and international locations 

our operations use navisphere a single platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with every party in their supply chain across languages currencies and continents navisphere offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands 

the navisphere carrier webbased platform provides contracted carriers additional access to our systems contract carriers can access available freight perform online check calls keep track of receivables and upload scanned documentation many of our carriers’ favorite features from navisphere carrier are also available through our navisphere carrier mobile application available for android and ios mobile operating systems 

our systems help our employees service customer orders select the optimal mode of transportation build and consolidate shipments and identify appropriate carriers all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems provide our vast organization the necessary business intelligence to allow for near real time scorecards and necessary decision support in all areas of our business 

government regulation 

our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified indirect air carrier providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of other us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and other similar antibribery and anticorruption statutes 

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international shipments and domestic air shipments with regards to international freight forwarding ocean transportation international and domestic air freight shipments and shipments transacted by freightquote we offer our customers the option to purchase shippers interest coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 200 million umbrella our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident 

as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims the deductible on our general liability coverage is 250000 per incident in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which were generally not insured we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident

risk factors 

tableend

the following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this 10k we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin  carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a revenue loss 

changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins  in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our net revenue margin may also fluctuate 

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services  we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions  our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including 

 we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks  we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model  our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition  competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against traditional and nontraditional logistics companies including transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and ondemand transportation service providers we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations in some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a revenue loss 

we rely on technology to operate our business  we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers 

as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks 

though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices  we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout north america europe asia australia new zealand and south america supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our offices operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry  results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season historically operating income and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future our results did not follow this pattern in 2016 as we experienced pricing declines throughout the year 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations  we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers’ ability to grow and harvest marketable crops 

buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims subject to a 250000 deductible is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the dot to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified indirect air carrier providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be 

able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

our contract carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers  our top 100 customers comprise approximately 30  percent of our consolidated total revenues and 26  percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately two  percent of our consolidated total revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply 

in 2016 changing market conditions impacted our results we had volume increases in nearly all of our service lines but also experienced pricing declines which impacted our net revenue margins truckload margin compression was a challenge to our earnings per share during the second half of the year in september 2016 we completed the acquisition of apc logistics “apc” a privately held company based in australia for the purpose of expanding our global presence and bringing additional capabilities and expertise to the our portfolio apc provides international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services in australia and new zealand apc operates in our global forwarding segment 

fuel prices declined throughout 2015 which contributed to slower growth of our total revenues and an increase in our transportation net revenue margins in 2015 we completed the acquisition of freightquotecom inc “freightquote” a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our ltl and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities freightquote operates in our nast segment the acquisition of freightquote contributed approximately 65 percentage points to our consolidated net revenue growth in 2015 primarily in our ltl service line 

we keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is tied to productivity and performance each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business 

our office network our office network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our network offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic 

our people  because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount increased by 966 employees during 2016 which includes approximately 300 employees added as a result of the apc acquisition compensation programs are performancebased and cash incentive is directly tied to productivity and performance most network management compensation is dependent on the profitability of their particular office we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders 

our customers  in 2016  we worked with more than 113000  active customers we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated in 2016  our top 100 customers represented approximately 30  percent of our total revenues and approximately 26  percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately two  percent of our total revenues 

our contracted carriers  our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2016  we worked with approximately 71000  transportation providers worldwide up from approximately 68000 in 2015  motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 81  percent of our truckload shipments in 2016  in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately 16  percent of our contracted carrier capacity

2016 compared to 2015 

total revenues and direct costs  total transportation revenues decreased 24 percent  to 117 billion  in 2016  from 120 billion  in 2015  this decrease in transportation revenues was driven by lower customer pricing in truckload partially offset by volume increases in nearly all of our transportation modes total purchased transportation and related services decreased 30 percent  in 2016  to 95 billion  from 98 billion  in 2015  this decrease was due to decreased transportation costs partially offset by higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes total sourcing revenues decreased 31 percent  to 14 billion  in 2016  from 15 billion  in 2015  purchased products sourced for resale decreased 35 percent  in 2016  to 13 billion  from 14 billion  in 2015  these decreases were primarily due to lower market pricing and change in service mix

we used 914 million  446 million  and 295 million  of cash for capital expenditures in 2016  2015  and 2014  we spent 250 million 260 million and 240 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems including the purchase and development of software these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business additionally in 2016 we completed construction of a second data recovery center the cost of this data recovery center was 200 million 193 million of which was spent in 2016 in 2014 we completed a new office building on our corporate campus in eden prairie minnesota this building was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and it replaced space we previously leased in eden prairie the cost of the building was approximately 185 million and the majority was funded in 2013 

we anticipate capital expenditures in 2017 to be approximately 60 million to 70 million 

cash used for financing activities  we used 1273 million  6077 million  and 1436 million  of cash flow for financing activities in 2016  2015  and 2014  

we had net shortterm borrowings of 2900 million  in 2016  and net shortterm repayments of 1550 million  in 2015  on october 29 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature in december of 2014 we amended this facility to increase the amount available from 500 million to 900 million extended the expiration of the facility from october 2017 to december 2019 and revised a covenant ratio this facility had 7400 million  outstanding as of december 31 2016  the original purpose of this facility was to partially fund an acquisition and will assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed leverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all of the credit facility’s debt covenants as of december 31 2016  

on august 23 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for 5000 million of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the accelerated share repurchase agreements that were entered into on august 24 2013 the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio an interest coverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31 2016  

we used 2454 million  2356 million  and 2150 million  to pay cash dividends in 2016  2015  and 2014  the increases were primarily the result of higher dividend rates partially offset by fewer outstanding shares 

we used 367 million  114 million  and 126 million  for stock tendered for payment of withholding taxes in 2016  2015  and 2014  

we also used 1729 million  2299 million  and 1640 million  on share repurchases in 2016  2015  and 2014  as part of our board approved repurchase program in august 2013 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2016  there were 4418564  shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditions 

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends for the foreseeable future we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition  total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable  our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 395 million  as of december 31 2016  decreased compared to the allowance of 435 million  as of december 31 2015  this decrease was primarily due to changes in the risk level of our accounts receivable portfolio we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

prior to the quarter ended december 31 2016 we managed and reported our operations as one operating segment and also concluded we had one reporting unit consisting of our network of offices and we evaluated goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis on december 31 we continually evaluate our reporting units and during the quarter ended december 31 2016 we concluded that we had seven reporting units as a result of this change in reporting units we allocated goodwill to our reporting units based on each reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach additionally at this time we changed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from december 31 to november 30 of each year the change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of our longterm planning process which is a significant input to the testing we performed a goodwill impairment assessment both prior to and after the change in reporting units at november 30 this change in testing date did not delay accelerate or avoid a goodwill impairment charge 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

based on our step one goodwill impairment analysis no impairments of goodwill were deemed to have occurred and the fair value of all of reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying value no events occurred from november 30 2016 to december 31 2016 to indicate any changes to our impairment conclusions at november 30 2016 

stockbased compensation  we issue stock awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units to key employees and outside directors in general the awards vest over five years either based on the company’s earnings growth or the passage of time the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 15 percent  to 22 percent  and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2016  dollars in thousands 



 

 we have no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable longterm notes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2016  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 189 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2016  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

we had 2477 million  of cash and cash equivalents on december 31 2016  substantially all of the cash equivalents are in demand accounts with financial institutions the primary market risks associated with these investments are liquidity risks 

we are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a 900 million revolving loan facility interest accrues on the revolving loan at variable rates based on libor or “prime” plus the applicable addon percentage as defined at december 31 2016  there was 7400 million  outstanding on the revolving loan 

we are a party to the note purchase agreement as amended with various institutional investors with fixed rates consisting of i 175000000 of the company’s 397 percent senior notes series a due august 27 2023 ii 150000000 of the company’s 426 percent senior notes series b due august 27 2028 and iii 175000000 of the company’s 460 percent senior notes series c due august 27 2033 at december 31 2016  there was 5000 million outstanding on the notes 

a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations

overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2015  consolidated total revenues of  135 billion  we are a service company we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2015  we handled approximately 169 million shipments and worked with more than 110000  active customers we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia and south america we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and costeffectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 68000  transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting 

in addition to transportation we provide sourcing services “sourcing” under the brand name robinson fresh “robinson fresh” our sourcing business is primarily the buying selling andor marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other valueadded perishable items it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through our network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and managed procurement services we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh valueadded produce under recognized consumer brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through our preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers 

our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our network of offices our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability and their contributions to the success of the company we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity 

our network offices work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in global account centers or in one office and rely on multiple locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 49 percent  of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between offices the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other offices and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional employees we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in january 2015 we completed our acquisition of freightquotecom inc “freightquote” a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our lessthantruckload and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities 

  

our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we sell our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and processes and utilizing our network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads air freight and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics company 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 

 customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account the team ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system this information is entered by our employees by the customer through our web tools or received electronically from the customers’ systems with the help of information provided by our operating system employees then select a contracted carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the employee may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different offices within our network collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customers’ freight and the offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the contracted carrier is selected the employee communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the cost for the transportation and the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication to meet our customers’ requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery 

  

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutually agreedupon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however if requested by the contract carrier we will estimate and report fuel separately in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several locations our transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network see note 1 to our 2015  consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for an allocation of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  and our longlived assets as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in the united states and in foreign locations 

  

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the periods indicated 



1 we previously reported revenues from the fees we earn from our cash advance option offered to our contract carriers separately from transportation revenues starting in the first quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis we are reporting these payment services revenues as a part of transportation total and net revenues 

transportation services accounted for approximately 95 percent of net revenues in 2015 94 percent of our net revenues in 2014 and 93 percent in 2013 the increase in ltl in 2015 was primarily due to the acquisition of freightquote on january 1 2015 the increases in ocean air and customs revenues in 2012 and 2013 were primarily related to our acquisition of phoenix international freight services ltd “phoenix” on november 1 2012 for additional information see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of part ii of this report 

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors 

our sourcing services have expanded to include forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of high quality fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately five percent of our net revenues in 2015 six percent of our net revenues in 2014 and seven percent of our net revenues in 2013   

organization 

office network  to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices in north america europe asia and south america in 2015 we derived approximately 90 percent  of our total revenues from customers in the united states 

each office is responsible for its own growth and profitability our employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the local level and offices cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation employees often rely on expertise in other offices when contracting ltl intermodal ocean and air shipments multiple network offices often also work together to service larger global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” office on the account 

  

employees both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts employees are also responsible for recruiting new over the road contract carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration “fmcsa” issued safety ratings 

network employees  each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate recruiting group that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

early in their tenure most newlyhired employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive members of a team including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training we expect most new employees to start contributing in a matter of weeks 

employees operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most network office managers and many other employees is dependent on the profitability of their particular office they are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the office’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the office within our 401k plan employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors 

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and may also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees 

employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual offices and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including management corporate sales and customer and carrier account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all management positions with current employees 

shared services our network offices are supported by our shared and centralized services approximately ten percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers approximately 44 percent of these shared services employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had a total of 13159  employees 11800 of whom were located in our network offices our remaining employees centrally serve our network of offices in areas such as finance information technology legal marketing and human resources 

customer relationships 

we work to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2015  we served over 110000  active customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries 

during 2015  our largest customer accounted for approximately two  percent of total revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive and shared services teams offices are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

in 2015 we continued to expand our corporate sales account management and marketing support to enhance sales capabilities the network also calls on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2015  we worked with approximately 68000  transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans and flatbeds these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than two  percent of our total cost of transportation in 2015  motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83  percent of our truckload shipments in 2015  every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and daily through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured 

  

has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1000 53foot containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

in our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional indirect air carrier “iac” internationally and in north america we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services nvoccs iacs and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 

  

seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends in recent years including 2015 and 2014 operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters however this was not our experience in 2013 we believe this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

proprietary information technology and intellectual property 

our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2015  we executed approximately 169  million shipments for more than 110000  active customers with more than 68000  contract carriers 

we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the united states and international locations 

our operations use navisphere ®  a single platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with every party in their supply chain across languages currencies and continents navisphere ®  offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands 

the chrwtrucks ®  webbased platform provides contracted carriers additional access to our systems contract carriers can access available freight perform online check calls keep track of receivables and upload scanned documentation many of our carriers’ favorite features from chrwtrucks ®  are also available through our chrwtrucks ®  mobile application available for android and ios mobile operating systems 

our systems help our employees service customer orders select the optimal mode of transportation build and consolidate shipments and identify appropriate carriers all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems provide our vast organization the necessary business intelligence to allow for near real time scorecards and necessary decision support in all areas of our business 

government regulation 

our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified indirect air carrier providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations 

  

we are subject to a variety of other us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and other similar antibribery and anticorruption statutes 

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation air freight businesses on international shipments and domestic air shipments with regards to international freight forwarding ocean transportation international and domestic air freight shipments and shipments transacted by freightquote we offer our customers the option to purchase shippers interest coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 200 million umbrella our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident 

as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims the deductible on our general liability coverage is 250000 per incident in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which were generally not insured beginning in 2012 we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident

risk factors 

tableend

the following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this 10k we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin  carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing 

  

changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins  in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our net revenue margin may also fluctuate 

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services  we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions  our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including 

 we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks  we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

  

as we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model  our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition  competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against logistics companies as well as transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations 

we rely on technology to operate our business  we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers 

as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks 

though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices  we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout north america europe asia and south america supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our offices operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry  results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years including 2015 and 2014 our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters however this was not our experience in 2013 although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

  

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations  we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers’ ability to grow and harvest marketable crops 

buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims subject to a 250000 deductible is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance did not cover prior to 2012 since 2012 we have carried product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified indirect air carrier providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be 

  

able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

our freight carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers  our top 100 customers comprise approximately 29  percent of our consolidated total revenues and 25  percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately two  percent of our consolidated total revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

we are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations for some legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses however based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

2 less than truckload “ltl” 

  

the following table represents certain statements of operations data shown as percentages of our net revenues 



overview 

our company  we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of offices in north america europe asia and south america as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 68000  transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk 

in addition to transportation and logistics services we also buy and sell fresh produce our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues 

our business model  we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply 

in 2015 changing market conditions impacted our results fuel prices declined throughout 2015 which contributed to slower growth of our total revenues and an increase in our transportation net revenue margins in 2015 we completed the acquisition of freightquotecom inc “freightquote” this acquisition contributed approximately 65 percentage points to our consolidated net revenue growth in 2015 primarily in our ltl service line 

in 2014 market conditions were very different than in 2013 there were capacity constraints in nearly all of our transportation services additionally we experienced a decrease in the length of haul in our north american truckload business in 2014 compared to 2013 which contributed to increased net revenue margin in our truckload transportation business in general a shorter length of haul can result in higher customer rates and transportation costs per mile 

we keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the office network based on the profitability of their individual office 

  

our personnel decisions are decentralized our office managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business 

our office network our office network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our network offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic 

in january 2015 we completed our acquisition of freightquote a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our ltl and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities 

our people  because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount increased by 1638 employees during 2015 approximately 60 percent of this increase is a result of our acquisition of freightquote employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of many of our employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their office we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders 

our customers  in 2015  we worked with more than 110000  active customers we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated in 2015 our top 100 customers represented approximately 29  percent of our total revenues and approximately 25  percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately two  percent of our total revenues 

our contracted carriers  our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2015  our carrier base was approximately 68000  up from approximately 63000 in 2014  motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83  percent of our truckload shipments in 2015  in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two  percent of our contracted carrier capacity 

2015 compared to 2014 

total revenues and direct costs  total transportation revenues increased 04 percent  to 120 billion  in 2015  from 119 billion  in 2014  this increase in transportation revenues was driven by our acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes these increases were partially offset by decreased pricing to our customers primarily related to the declining cost of fuel total purchased transportation and related services decreased 20 percent  in 2015  to 98 billion  from 100 billion  in 2014  this decrease was due to decreased transportation costs primarily related to the declining cost of fuel partially offset by the acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes our sourcing revenue decreased 31 percent  to 149 billion  in 2015  from 153 billion  in 2014  purchased products sourced for resale decreased 37 percent  in 2015  to 137 billion  from 142 billion  in 2014  these decreases were primarily due to decreased revenue and cost per case partially offset by increased case volumes 

net revenues  total transportation net revenues increased 135 percent  to 21 billion  in 2015  from 19 billion  in 2014  our transportation net revenue margin increased to 179 percent  in 2015  from 159 percent  in 2014  this increase in net revenue margin was driven by a decrease in transportation costs including fuel and a change in the mix of business due to growth in shorter length of haul freight and the addition of freightquote 

  

our truckload net revenues increased 106 percent  to 13 billion  in 2015  from 12 billion  in 2014  truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015  organic truckload net revenues increased approximately seven percent in 2015 our acquisition of freightquote contributed approximately 35 percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth in 2015 north american truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015 north american truckload volumes excluding freightquote increased approximately three percent in 2015 truckload net revenue margin increased in 2015  due the declining cost of fuel in our truckload business the cost of fuel is generally a pass through to our customers therefore in periods of declining fuel prices we tend to experience higher net revenue margin excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel on average our truckload rates increased approximately one percent in 2015  our truckload transportation costs were relatively unchanged excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel 

ltl net revenues increased 393 percent  to 3607 million  in 2015  from 2589 million  in 2014  freightquote contributed approximately 33 percentage points to our ltl net revenue growth in 2015 net revenue margin increased in 2015 as the result of a change in our freight mix with more small customers from the higher margin freightquote business ltl volumes increased approximately 32 percent in 2015 

our intermodal net revenue increased 10 percent  to 411 million  in 2015  from 406 million  in 2014  freightquote contributed approximately 34 million to our intermodal net revenues in 2015 conversion to truckload from intermodal negatively impacted intermodal volumes and net revenues throughout 2015 our intermodal net revenues declined throughout 2015 and that trend has continued into 2016 

our ocean transportation net revenues increased 73 percent  to 2236 million  in 2015  from 2084 million  in 2014  the increase in net revenues was primarily due to increased net revenue margin and volumes 

our air transportation net revenues were unchanged at 791 million  in 2015  from 791 million  in 2014  this was the result of higher volumes offset by pricing declines 

our customs net revenues increased 57 percent  to 439 million  in 2015  from 416 million  in 2014  the increase was due to increased transaction volumes 

other logistics services net revenues which include managed services warehousing and small parcel increased 129 percent  to 825 million  in 2015  from 731 million  in 2014  the increase in 2015  was primarily due to growth in managed services as a result of adding new customers freightquote contributed approximately two percentage points to our other logistics services net revenue growth in 2015 

sourcing net revenues increased 47 percent  to 1210 million  in 2015  from 1155 million  in 2014  this increase was primarily due to an increase in case volumes slightly offset by a decrease in net revenue per case our net revenue margin increased to 81 percent  in 2015  compared to 75 percent  in 2014  

operating expenses  operating expenses increased 120 percent  to 14 billion  in 2015  from 13 billion  in 2014  this was due to an increase of 120 percent  in personnel expenses and an increase of 120 percent  in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses decreased to 622 percent  in 2015  from 627 percent  in 2014  

our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth in 2015  personnel expenses increased to 11 billion  from 09 billion  in 2014  our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased in 2015  to 463 percent  from 468 percent  in 2014  the increase in personnel expense was due primarily to an increase in average headcount growth of approximately 14 percent in 2015 freightquote contributed approximately eight percentage points of the growth in average headcount during 2015 in addition we experienced growth in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability 

other selling general and administrative expenses increased 120 percent  to 3588 million  in 2015  from 3202 million  in 2014  the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily due to our acquisition of freightquote including amortization expense of 76 million and an increase in travel expenses

interest and other expense  interest and other expense was 355 million  in 2015  compared to 250 million  in 2014  during the fourth quarter we wrote off an indemnification asset of 72 million related to the acquisition of phoenix as the indemnification obligations of the sellers expired the impact of this write off was partially offset within the provision for income taxes by related tax liabilities that expired under applicable statute of limitations in addition we had a higher average outstanding balance on our shortterm borrowings throughout 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of freightquote 

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 381 percent  for 2015  and 378 percent  for 2014  the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal benefit

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock in december 2014 we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the amount available from 500 million to 900 million to extend the expiration date from october 2017 to december 2019 and to revise a covenant ratio in 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement to fund the accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase 500 million worth of our common stock the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility we also expect to use the revolving credit facility and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases cash and cash equivalents totaled 1682 million  and 1289 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 1143 million  and 806 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  working capital at december 31 2015  was 2821 million  working capital at december 31 2014  was 5296 million  

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities 

cash flow from operating activities  we generated 7183 million  5134 million  and 3478 million  of cash flow from operations in 2015  2014  and 2013  the increase of 2049 million  in cash flow from operations in 2015  is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in net income partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable the decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily the result of declining fuel prices 

cash used for investing activities  we used 544 million  of cash in 2015  3889 million  of cash in 2014  and 289 million  of cash in 2013  for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions on december 31 2014 we funded 3594 million  of the purchase price for the acquisition of freightquote into escrow accounts pursuant to the purchase agreement and for completion of the acquisition in january 2015 

  

we used 446 million  295 million  and 482 million  of cash for capital expenditures in 2015  2014  and 2013  we spent 260 million 240 millionand 359 million in 2015  2014  and 2013  primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems including the purchase and development of software these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business additionally in 2014 we completed a new office building on our corporate campus in eden prairie minnesota this building was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and it replaced space we previously leased in eden prairie the cost of the building was approximately 185 million and the majority was funded in 2013 

we anticipate capital expenditures in 2016 to be approximately 70 million to 80 million the increase is primarily the result of the planned construction of an additional data center which is expected to be completed in 2016 

cash used for financing activities  we used 6077 million  1436 million  and 3649 million  of cash flow for financing activities in 2015  2014  and 2013  

we had net shortterm repayments of 1550 million  in 2015  and net shortterm borrowings of 2300 million  in 2014  on october 29 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature in december of 2014 we amended this facility to increase the amount available from 500 million to 900 million extended the expiration of the facility from october 2017 to december 2019 and revise a covenant ratio this facility had 4500 million  outstanding as of december 31 2015  the original purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and will assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed leverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all of the credit facility’s debt covenants as of december 31 2015  

on august 23 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for 5000 million of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24 2013 the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio an interest coverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31 2015  the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility 

we used 2356 million  2150 million  and 2203 million  to pay cash dividends in 2015  2014  and 2013  the increase in 2015  was primarily the result of higher dividends paid compared to 2014  the decrease in 2014 was due to a decrease in the number of shares outstanding compared to 2013 primarily as a result of the accelerated share repurchases made in 2013 

we also used 2299 million  1640 million  and 7573 million  on share repurchases in 2015  2014  and 2013  in august 2013 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2015  there were 6885661  shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditions 

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed

revenue recognition  total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage managed services freight forwarding and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable  our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 435 million  as of december 31 2015  increased compared to the allowance of 411 million  as of december 31 2014  this increase was primarily due to changes in the risk level of our accounts receivable portfolio we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill  we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our network of offices represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2015  

stockbased compensation  we issue stock awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units to key employees and outside directors in general the awards vest over five years either based on the company’s earnings growth or the passage of time the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 17 percent  to 22 percent  and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2015  dollars in thousands

we have no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable longterm notes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 196 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2015  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we had 1682 million  of cash and cash equivalents on december 31 2015  substantially all of the cash equivalents are in demand accounts with financial institutions the primary market risks associated with these investments are liquidity risks 

we are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a 900 million revolving loan facility interest accrues on the revolving loan at variable rates based on libor or “prime” plus the applicable addon percentage as defined at december 31 2015  there was 4500 million  outstanding on the revolving loan 

we are a party to the note purchase agreement as amended with various institutional investors with fixed rates consisting of i 175000000 of the company’s 397 percent senior notes series a due august 27 2023 ii 150000000 of the company’s 426 percent senior notes series b due august 27 2028 and iii 175000000 of the company’s 460 percent senior notes series c due august 27 2033 at december 31 2015  there was 5000 million outstanding on the notes 

a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations

overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2014  consolidated total revenues of  135 billion  we are a service company we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2014  we handled approximately 143 million shipments and worked with more than 46000  active customers we operate through a network of 281  offices in north america europe asia and south america we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and costeffectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 66000  transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting 

in addition to transportation we provide sourcing services “sourcing” through robinson fresh robinson fresh our sourcing business is primarily the buying selling and marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other perishable items it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through our network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and merchandising we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh produce under recognized consumer brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through our preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers 

historically we provided feebased payment services payment services primarily through our subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek tchek provided a variety of payment management and business intelligence services primarily to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors those services included funds transfer fuel purchasing and online expense management for most of these services tchek charged a fee per transaction on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of tchek to electronic funds source llc efs we continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance option we offer our contracted carriers through continued agreements with efs 

our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our network of 281  offices our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability and their contributions to the success of the company we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity 

our offices work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one office and rely on multiple locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 48 percent  of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between offices our methodology of providing services is very similar across all locations the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other offices and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional employees we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in january 2015 we completed our acquisition of freightquotecom inc freightquote a privately held freight broker based in kansas city missouri freightquote provides services throughout north america the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our lessthantruckload and truckload businesses and expands our ecommerce capabilities 

our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we sell our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and technology processes and utilizing our network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads air freight carriers and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics company 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 

 customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson team responsible for their account the team ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system this information is entered by our employees by the customer through our web tools or received electronically from the customers systems with the help of information provided by our operating system the salesperson then selects a contracted carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly 

before setting a price in many cases employees from different offices collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customers’ freight and the offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the contracted carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the cost for the transportation and the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication to meet our customers’ requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our managed services business we are acting as the shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutually agreedupon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however if requested by the contract carrier we will estimate and report fuel separately in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customers’ warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several locations our transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network see note 1 to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for an allocation of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation net revenues   



transportation services accounted for approximately 94 percent of our net revenues in 2014 93 percent in 2013 and 89 percent of our net revenues in 2012 the increases in ocean air and customs revenues in 2012 and 2013 are primarily related to our acquisition of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix on november 1 2012 

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors 

our sourcing services have expanded to include forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately six percent of our net revenues in 2014 seven percent of our net revenues in 2013 and eight percent of our net revenues in 2012   

payment services 

on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the operations of tchek which represented a majority of our payment services however we still earn payment services revenues when we advance money to our contract carriers 

payment services accounted for less than one percent of our net revenues in 2014 and 2013 and three percent of our net revenues in 2012 

organization 

branch office network  to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices we currently have 281  branches in the following areas of the world   



each is responsible for its own growth and profitability our employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the local level and locations cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation employees may rely on expertise in other offices when contracting ltl intermodal ocean and air shipments multiple offices may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” office on the account 

employees both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts employees are also responsible for recruiting new over the road contract carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa issued safety ratings 

network employees  each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate recruiting group that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

early in their tenure most newlyhired employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive members of a team including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training we expect most new employees to start contributing in a matter of weeks 

employees operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and employees is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch they are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the office within our 401k plan employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the manager and key employees for a short period of time  

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees 

employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual offices and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including management corporate sales and customer and carrier account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all management positions with current employees 

shared services our offices are supported by our shared and centralized services approximately ten percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers approximately 45 percent of these shared services employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had a total of 11521  employees 10300 of whom were located in our branch offices services such as finance information technology legal marketing and human resource support are supported centrally 

customer relationships 

we work to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2014  we served over 46000  active customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries 

during 2014  our largest customer accounted for approximately two  percent of total revenues and approximately one  percent of net revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive and shared services teams offices are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

in 2014 we continued to expand our corporate sales account management and marketing support to enhance sales capabilities the network also calls on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2014  we worked with approximately 66000  transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans and flatbeds these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was approximately two  percent of our total cost of transportation in 2014  motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83  percent of our truckload shipments in 2014  every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and daily through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1000 53foot containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

in our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional indirect air carrier iac internationally and in north america we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services nvoccs iacs and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are

seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends in recent years including 2014 operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters however this was not our experience in 2013 or 2012 2012 would have followed this pattern but our fourth quarter results were impacted by certain significant eventspecific charges and credits related to our acquisitions and divestitures we believe this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

proprietary information technology and intellectual property 

our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2014  we executed approximately 143  million shipments for more than 46000  active customers and 66000  contract carriers 

we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the united states and international locations 

in october 2012 we launched navisphere ®  a single platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with every party in their supply chain across languages currencies and continents navisphere ®  offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands 

the chrwtrucks ®  webbased platform provides contracted carriers additional access to our systems contract carriers can access available freight perform online check calls keep track of receivables and upload scanned documentation many of our carriers favorite features from chrwtrucks ®  are also available through our chrwtrucks ®  mobile application available for android and ios mobile operating systems 

our systems help our employees service customer orders select the optimal mode of transportation build and consolidate shipments and identify appropriate carriers all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems provide our vast organization the necessary business intelligence to allow for real time scorecards and necessary decision support in all areas of our business 

government regulation 

our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and an nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified indirect air carrier providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of other us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and other similar antibribery and anticorruption statutes 

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation air freight businesses on international shipments and domestic air shipments we do offer our customers the option to purchase shippers interest coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 200 million umbrella our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident 

as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims the deductible on our general liability coverage is 250000 per incident in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which were generally not insured beginning in 2012 we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident

risk factors 

tableend

the following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this 10k we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 13 

higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin  carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing 

changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins  in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of fluctuating fuel prices our net revenue margin declines 

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services  we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions  our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including 

 we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks  we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model  our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition  competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against logistics companies as well as transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations 

we rely on technology to operate our business  we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner if we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers 

as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks 

though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices  we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout north america europe asia and south america supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our offices operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry  results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years including 2014 our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters however this was not our experience in 2013 or 2012 2012 would have followed this pattern but our fourth quarter results were impacted by certain significant eventspecific charges and credits related to our acquisitions and divestitures although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations  we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers ability to grow and harvest marketable crops 

buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims subject to a 250000 deductible is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance did not cover prior to 2012 since 2012 we have carried product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and an nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified indirect air carrier providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be 

able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and or prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

our freight carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers  our top 100 customers comprise approximately 37  percent of our consolidated total revenues and 26  percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately two  percent of our consolidated total revenues and approximately one  percent of our consolidated net revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

overview 

our company  we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of offices in north america europe asia and south america as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 66000  transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk 

in addition to transportation and logistics services we also buy and sell fresh produce and offer feebased payment services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues historically our payment services business consisted primarily of our former subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of our payment services business to electronic funds source we continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance options we offer our contracted carriers 

our business model  we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply 

in 2014 changing market conditions impacted our results there were capacity constraints in nearly all of our transportation services additionally we experienced a decrease in the length of haul in our north american truckload business in 2014 compared to 2013 which contributed to increased net revenue margin in our truckload transportation business in general a shorter length of haul can result in higher customer rates and transportation costs per mile 

we keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the office network based on the profitability of their individual office in 2014 we were able to leverage our past investments of talent and adapt to changing market conditions and drive efficiencies in our network we experienced

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock in 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix in december 2014 we amended the revolving credit facility to increase the amount available from 500 million to 900 million and to extend the expiration date from october 2017 to december 2019 in 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement to fund the accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase 500 million worth of our common stock the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility we also expect to use the revolving credit facility and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures possible acquisitions dividends and share repurchases cash and cash equivalents totaled 1289 million  and 1620 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 806 million  and 802 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  working capital at december 31 2014  was 5296 million  which included 3594 million  of restricted cash working capital at december 31 2013  was 3945 million  

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities 

cash flow from operating activities  we generated 5134 million  3478 million  and 4603 million  of cash flow from operations in 2014  2013  and 2012  the increase of 1656 million in cash flow from operations in 2014 is primarily the result of a 1015 million decrease in accrued income taxes and increases in stockbased compensation and accrued compensation and profitsharing during the first quarter of 2013 we used 1118 million to fund the payment of income taxes primarily related to the gain recognized on the divestiture of tchek 

cash used for investing activities  we used 3889 million  of cash in 2014  289 million  of cash in 2013  and 3591 million  of cash in 2012  for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions on december 31 2014 we funded 3594 million  of the purchase price for the acquisition of freightquote into escrow accounts pursuant to the purchase agreement and completion of the acquisition in january 2015 in 2012 cash received for the divestiture of tchek net of the cash we sold was 2748 million

on august 23 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for 5000 million of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24 2013 the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio an interest coverage ratio and minimum liquidity we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31 2014  the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility 

we used 2150 million  2203 million  and 2754 million  to pay cash dividends in 2014  2013  and 2012  the decrease in 2014 was due to a decrease in the number of shares outstanding compared to 2013 the decrease in 2013 was due to a fifth quarterly dividend paid in 2012 and a lower number of shares outstanding in 2013 partially offset by an increase in the dividend rate in 2013 to 035 per share from 033 per share in 2012 

we also used 1640 million  7573 million  and 2451 million  on share repurchases in 2014  2013  and 2012  the increase in 2013 was due to the 5000 million of shares repurchased as part of the asr agreements entered into during the third quarter of 2013 we received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements in december 2013 one of the banks terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement in august 2013 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2014  there were 10306342  shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditions 

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition  total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable  our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 411 million  as of december 31 2014  increased compared to the allowance of 393 million  as of december 31 2013  this increase was primarily due to growth in our accounts receivable balance we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill  we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2014  

stockbased compensation  we issue stock awards including stock options performance shares and restricted stock units to key employees and outside directors in general the awards vest over five years either based on the companys earnings growth or the passage of time the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 17 percent  to 22 percent  and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2014  dollars in thousands 

  



 

 we have no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable longterm notes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2014  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 240 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2014  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk

we had 1289 million  of cash and investments on december 31 2014  consisting entirely of cash and cash equivalents although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks 

we are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a 900 million revolving loan facility interest accrues on the revolving loan at variable rates based on libor or prime plus the applicable addon percentage as defined at december 31 2014  there was 6050 million  outstanding on the revolving loan

a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations

overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2013 consolidated total revenues of  128 billion  we are a service company we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2013  we handled approximately 127 million shipments and worked with more than 46000  active customers we operate through a network of 285  offices which we call branches in north america europe asia south america and australia we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 63000  transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting 

in addition to transportation we provide sourcing services “sourcing” our sourcing business is primarily the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through our network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and merchandising we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh produce under consumer recognized brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through our preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers 

historically we provided feebased payment services payment services primarily through our subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek tchek provided a variety of payment management and business intelligence services primarily to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors those services included funds transfer fuel purchasing and online expense management for most of these services tchek charged a fee per transaction on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of tchek to electronic funds source llc efs we expect to continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance option we offer our contracted carriers through continued agreements with efs 

our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our branch network of 285  offices our branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity 

our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 46 percent  of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional branch employees we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in october 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of the operating subsidiaries of apreo logistics sa apreo a leading freight forwarder based in warsaw poland this acquisition enhances our truckload capabilities in europe in november 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix an international freight forwarder based in chicago illinois phoenix has a strong track record and diverse customer base in the international freight forwarding industry this acquisition expanded our global forwarding network and market presence 

our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and technology processes and utilizing our network of subcontracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads air freight carriers and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive subcontracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics company 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 

 customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson branch responsible for their account the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system this information is entered by our employees by the customer through our web tools or received electronically from the customers systems with the help of information provided by our operating system the salesperson then selects a contracted carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and 

rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different branches collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customers’ freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the contracted carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the cost for the transportation and the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication to meet our customers’ requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our management services business we are acting as the shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutually agreed upon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however if requested by the contract carrier we will estimate and report fuel separately in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customers’ warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for an allocation of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation net revenues   



transportation services accounted for approximately 93 percent of our net revenues in 2013 89 percent of our net revenues in 2012 and 88 percent of our net revenues in 2011 the increases in ocean air and customs revenues in 2012 and 2013 are primarily related to our acquisition of phoenix on november 1 2012 

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors 

our sourcing services have expanded to include forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately seven percent of our net revenues in 2013 and eight percent of our net revenues in 2012 and 2011   

payment services 

on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the operations of tchek which represented a majority of our payment services however we still earn payment services revenues when we advance money to our contract carriers 

payment services accounted for less than one percent of our net revenues in 2013 three percent of our net revenues in 2012 and four percent of our net revenues in 2011 

organization 

branch network  to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices which we call branches we currently have 285  branches in the following areas of the world   



each branch is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation branch employees are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

employees in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts branch employees are also responsible for recruiting new over the road contract carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to assure they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa issued safety ratings 

branch employees  branch offices are responsible for their hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their branch and balancing personnel resources with their business requirements because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate recruiting group that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

early in their tenure most newlyhired branch employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive members of a branch team including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training at the branch level we expect most new branch employees to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks 

employees at a branch operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and branch employees is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch branch managers and most branch employees are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the branch within our 401k plan employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key branch employees for a short period of time  

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees 

individual branch employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management corporate sales and account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

shared services 

our branches are supported by our shared and centralized services approximately ten percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers approximately 44 percent of these shared services employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we had a total of 11676  employees 10508 of whom were located in our branch offices services such as finance information technology legal marketing and human resource support are supported centrally 

customer relationships 

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2013 we served over 46000  active customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries 

during 2013  our largest customer accounted for approximately three  percent of total revenues and approximately two  percent of net revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our branch employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive team branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

we have also expanded our corporate sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities branches also call on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to assure dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2013  we worked with approximately 63000  transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our branch employees regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans and flatbeds these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was approximately two  percent of our total cost of transportation in 2013  motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83  percent of our truckload shipments in 2013  every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and daily through subscriptions with a third party service we assure that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we own approximately 1000 53foot containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

in our nvocc ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional air freight forwarder internationally and in north america we select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 

seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends in recent years operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although this was not our experience in 2013 or 2012 2012 would have followed this pattern but our fourth quarter results were impacted by certain significant eventspecific charges and credits related to our acquisitions and divestitures we believe this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

proprietary information technology and intellectual property 

our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2013  we executed approximately 127  million shipments for more than 46000  active customers and 63000  contract carriers 

we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the united states and international locations 

in october 2012 we launched navisphere ®  a single platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with every party in their supply chain across languages currencies and continents navisphere ®  offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands 

the chrwtrucks ®  webbased platform provides contracted carriers additional access to our systems contract carriers can access available freight perform online check calls keep track of receivables and upload scanned documentation many of our carriers favorite features from chrwtrucks ®  are also available through our chrwtrucks ®  mobile application available for android and ios mobile operating systems 

our systems help our branch employees service customer orders select the optimal mode of transportation build and consolidate shipments and identify appropriate carriers all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems provide our vast organization the necessary business intelligence to allow for real time scorecards and necessary decision support in all areas of our business 

government regulation 

our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as a department of homeland security certified indirect air carrier providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we source fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of other us and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and other similar antibribery and anticorruption statutes 

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we do offer our customers the option to purchase shippers interest coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 200 million umbrella our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident 

as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which were generally not insured beginning in 2012 we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident

risk factors

you should consider carefully the following cautionary statements if you own our common stock or are planning to buy our common stock we intend to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” by providing this discussion 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 13 

to our business needs in addition we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand 

higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin  carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing 

changing fuel costs may have an impact on our net revenue margins  in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues rising fuel prices may result in a decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage declines 

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services  we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political conditions  all of our business operations are subject to the influences of significant political changes and our ability to respond to them including 

 we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks  we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model  our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition  competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against logistics companies as well as transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations 

we are reliant on technology to operate our business  we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users we are reliant on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner 

as demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks 

though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices  we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america europe asia south america and australia supported by executives and shared and centralized services with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business in their branch and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry  results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although this was not our experience in 2013 or 2012 2012 would have followed this pattern but our fourth quarter results were impacted by certain significant eventspecific charges and credits related to our acquisitions and divestitures although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations  we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident in 2011 2012 and 2013 a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently to assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make advances to growers to finance their operations repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers ability to grow and harvest marketable crops 

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination this risk is mitigated in the majority of cases where we source produce as we do not handle or package the product product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance did not cover prior to 2012 beginning in 2012 we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations  our business operations are regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a property freight broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nvocc bond and by the transportation security administration as an independent air carrier we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and or prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

a significant increase in fraud or theft could adversely affect our results  we have exposure to both internal and external fraud and theft unauthorized or fraudulent requests for advances or payment can occur a significant increase in fraudulent activity could adversely affect our results 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers  our top 100 customers comprise approximately 32  percent of our consolidated total revenues and 28  percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately three  percent of our consolidated total revenues and approximately two  percent of our consolidated net revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by ten percent there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

we are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations for such legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses however based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

overview 

our company  we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of branch offices in north america europe asia south america and australia as a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 63000  transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk 

in addition to transportation and logistics services we also offer fresh produce sourcing and feebased payment services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues historically our payment services business consisted primarily of our former subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek which provided a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of tchek to electronic funds source efs we continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance options we offer our contracted carriers 

our business model  we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply we also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the branch network based on the profitability of their individual branch office 

in addition we do not have precommitted targets for headcount our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their branchs volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business 

our branch network  our branch network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our branch offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic 

in october 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of the operating subsidiaries of apreo logistics sa apreo a leading freight forwarder based in warsaw poland this acquisition enhances our truckload capabilities in europe in november 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix an international freight forwarder based in chicago illinois phoenix has a strong track record and diverse customer base in the international freight forwarding industry this acquisition expanded our global forwarding network 

our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 46  percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

our people  because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount grew by 747 employees during 2013 branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of many of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees in 2012 and 2013 we also issued restricted equity awards that vest evenly over five years starting on december 31 2013 and december 31 2014 

our customers  in 2013  we worked with more than 46000  active customers up from approximately 42000 in 2012  we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated our top 100 customers represented approximately 32   percent of our total revenues and approximately 28  percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately three  percent of our total revenues and approximately two  percent of our total net revenues 

our contracted carriers  our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2013  our carrier base was approximately 63000  up from approximately 56000 in 2012  motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83  percent of our truckload shipments in 2013 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two  percent of our contracted carrier capacity 

2013 compared to 2012 

total revenues and direct costs  our consolidated total revenues increased 123 percent  in 2013  compared to 2012  total transportation revenues increased 143 percent  to 111 billion  in 2013  from 97 billion  in 2012  this increase was driven by higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes the phoenix acquisition and increased pricing to our customers including the impacts of higher fuel costs total purchased transportation and related services increased 149 percent  in 2013  to 94 billion  from 82 billion  in 2012  this increase was due to higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes the phoenix acquisition and higher transportation costs our sourcing revenue increased 30 percent  to 17 billion  in 2013  from 16 billion  in 2012  this increase was primarily due to higher case volumes purchased products sourced for resale increased 39 percent  in 2013  to 154 billion  from 148 billion  in 2012  this increase was primarily due to higher case volumes and higher cost per case our payment services revenue decreased 753 percent  to 132 million  in 2013  from 535 million  in 2012  the decrease was due to the sale of substantially all of our payment services business tchek to efs on october 16 2012 

net revenues  total transportation net revenues increased 111 percent  to 170 billion  in 2013  from 153 billion  in 2012  our transportation net revenue margin decreased to 153 percent  in 2013  from 158 percent  in 2012  largely driven by higher transportation costs partially offset by an increase in transportation rates charged to our customers 

our truckload net revenues decreased 05 percent  to 105 billion  in 2013  from 106 billion  in 2012  truckload volumes increased approximately ten percent in 2013  truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2013  due to increased cost of capacity partially offset by increased rates charged to our customers excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel on average our truckload rates increased approximately two percent in 2013  our truckload transportation costs increased approximately three percent excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel 

ltl net revenues increased 68 percent  to 2395 million  in 2013  from 2242 million  in 2012  the increase in net revenues was driven by an increase in total shipments of seven percent partially offset by decreased net revenue margin our ltl transportation costs are increasing while customer pricing has not kept up with increases in carrier costs 

our intermodal net revenue increase of 07 percent  to 391 million  in 2013  from 388 million  in 2012  was driven largely by a change in the mix of business and improved customer pricing partially offset by volume declines 

our ocean transportation net revenues increased 1210 percent  to 1877 million  in 2013  from 849 million  in 2012  our air transportation net revenues increased 645 percent  to 731 million  in 2013  from 444 million  in 2012 our customs net revenues increased 1007 percent  to 366 million  in 2013  from 182 million  in 2012 these increases were primarily driven by our acquisition of phoenix 

other logistics services net revenues which include transportation management services warehousing and small parcel increased 182 percent  to 679 million  in 2013  from 574 million  in 2012  this increase was primarily due to an increase in warehouse services 

sourcing net revenues decreased 70 percent  to 1270 million  in 2013  from 1364 million  in 2012  this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in business with a large customer and a decrease in net revenue per case partially offset by increased volumes we expect the revenue declines with this large customer to continue in 2014 our net revenue margin decreased to 76 percent  in 2013  compared to 84 percent  in 2012  

historically payment services was comprised primarily of revenue related to our former subsidiary tchek payment services net revenues decreased 797 percent  to 108 million  in 2013  from 530 million  in 2012  the decrease was due to the tchek divestiture on october 16 2012 we continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance options we offer our contracted carriers 

operating expenses  operating expenses increased 107 percent  to 12 billion  in 2013  from 10 billion  in 2012  this was due to an increase of 79 percent  in personnel expenses and an increase of 183 percent  in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses increased to 628 percent  in 2013  from 607 percent  in 2012  this increase was primarily due to increased personnel and other selling general and administrative expenses as a result of our acquisitions in 2012 

our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth in 2013  personnel expenses increased to 8267 million  from 7660 million  in 2012  our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2013  to 450 percent  from 446 percent  in 2012  in 2013  our average headcount increased approximately 25 percent related primarily to the acquisitions of apreo and phoenix the increase in personnel expense from headcount growth was partially offset by declines in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability 

other selling general and administrative expenses increased 183 percent  to 3268 million  in 2013  from 2762 million  in 2012  the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in amortization of intangible assets acquired occupancy and travel partially offset by a reduction in purchased professional services 

income from operations  income from operations increased 11 percent  to 6827 million  in 2013  from 6753 million  in 2012  income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 372 percent  in 2013  from 393 percent  in 2012  this decrease was due to our expenses growing faster than our net revenues additionally phoenix has a higher operating expense to net revenue ratio than ch robinson has historically experienced 

investment and other expense income  investment and other expense income was an expense of 93 million  in 2013  compared to income of 2831 million  in 2012  in 2013 we recorded interest expense on borrowings of 111 million in 2012 we recorded a gain of 2816 million on the divestiture of substantially all of our tchek business 

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 382 percent  for 2013  and 380 percent  for 2012  the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal benefit 

net income  net income decreased 300 percent  to 4159 million  in 2013  from 5938 million  in 2012  basic net income per share decreased 280 percent  to 265  diluted net income per share decreased 278 percent  to 265  

2012 compared to 2011 

total revenues and direct costs  our consolidated total revenues increased 99 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 total transportation revenues increased 108 percent to 969 billion in 2012 from 874 billion in 2011 this increase was driven by higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and increased pricing to our customers including the impacts of higher fuel costs total purchased transportation and related services increased 118 percent in 2012 to 816 billion from 730 billion in 2011 this increase was due to higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and higher transportation costs including the impacts of higher fuel costs our sourcing revenue increased 55 percent to 162 billion in 2012 from 154 billion in 2011 purchased products sourced for resale increased 54 percent in 2012 to 148 billion from 141 billion in 2011 these increases were primarily due to higher case volumes our payment services revenue decreased 112 percent to 535 million in 2012 from 603 million in 2011 the decrease was due to the sale of substantially all of our payment services business tchek to electronic funds source llc on october 16 2012 

net revenues  total transportation net revenues increased 58 percent to 153 billion in 2012 from 144 billion in 2011 our transportation net revenue margin decreased to 158 percent in 2012 from 165 percent in 2011 largely driven by higher transportation costs and higher fuel costs partially offset by an increase in transportation rates charged to our customers while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough in our truckload business therefore in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage decreases as it did in 2012 

our truckload net revenues increased 21 percent  to 106 billion  in 2012 from 104 billion  in 2011 truckload volumes increased approximately ten percent in 2012 truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2012 due to increased cost of capacity and an increase in fuel prices partially offset by increased rates charged to our customers excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel on average our truckload rates increased approximately one percent in 2012 our truckload transportation costs increased approximately two percent excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel 

during 2012 our ltl net revenues increased approximately 13 percent to 2242 million from 1987 million in 2011 the increase was driven primarily by an increase in shipment volumes and increased pricing to our customers partially offset by increased cost of capacity our ltl volumes increased approximately 16 percent compared to 2011 

our intermodal net revenue decrease of 58 percent to 388 million in 2012 from 412 million in 2011 was driven largely by increased cost of capacity 

our ocean transportation net revenues increased 270 percent to 849 million in 2012 from 669 million in 2011 our air transportation net revenues increased 129 percent to 444 million in 2012 from 394 million in 2011 our customs net revenues increased 391 percent  to 182 million  in 2012 from 131 million  in 2011 these increases were primarily due to our acquisition of phoenix on november 1 2012 

other logistics services net revenues which include transportation management services warehousing and small parcel increased 228 percent  to 574 million  in 2012 from 468 million  in 2011 this increase was primarily due to transaction increases in our transportation management services 

sourcing net revenues increased 62 percent to 1364 million in 2012 from 1284 million in 2011 this increase was primarily due to increased volumes and a slight increase in net revenue per case our net revenue margin remained at 84 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 

historically payment services was comprised primarily of revenue related to our former subsidiary tchek payment services net revenues decreased 121 percent to 530 million in 2012 from 603 million in 2011 the decrease was due to the tchek divestiture on october 16 2012 we recorded a gain of 2816 million related to this divestiture in 2012 we continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance options we offer our contracted carriers 

operating expenses  operating expenses increased 109 percent to 104 billion in 2012 from 9399 million in 2011 this was due to an increase of 100 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 134 percent in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses increased to 607 percent in 2012 from 576 percent in 2011 this increase was primarily due to increased personnel and other selling general and administrative expenses incurred because of our acquisitions and divestitures in 2012 

our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth in 2012 personnel expenses increased to 7660 million from 6962 million in 2011 our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2012 to 446 percent from 426 percent in 2011 these increases were primarily due to an increase in vesting expense of 330 million of our equity awards triggered by the gain on the divestiture of tchek in 2012 our average headcount increased approximately 136 percent due primarily to the acquisitions of apreo and phoenix personnel expenses related to our various incentive plans are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability 

other selling general and administrative expenses increased 134 percent to 2762 million in 2012 from 2437 million in 2011 approximately 106 million of this increase is related to investment banking and other external legal and accounting fees paid for the acquisitions and divestitures in 2012 the remaining increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in travel amortization of intangible assets acquired temporary services and warehouse expenses partially offset by a reduction in claims 

income from operations  income from operations decreased 25 percent to 6753 million in 2012 from 6927 million in 2011 income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 393 percent in 2012 from 424 percent in 2011 these decreases were primarily related to the increases in operating expenses offset partially by an increase in net revenues 

investment and other income  investment and other income increased to 2831 million in 2012 compared to 20 million in 2011 in 2012 we recorded a gain of 2816 million on the divestiture of substantially all of our tchek business 

provision for income taxes  our effective income tax rate was 380 percent for 2012 and 379 percent for 2011 the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal benefit 

net income  net income increased 376 percent to 5938 million in 2012 from 4316 million in 2011 basic net income per share increased 399 percent to 368 diluted net income per share increased 401 percent to 367 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock in 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix in 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement to fund the accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase 5000 million worth of our common stock we also expect to use the revolving credit facility and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future to assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases cash and cash equivalents totaled 1620 million  and 2100 million  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 802 million  and 1033 million as of december 31 2013  and 2012  working capital at december 31 2013  and 2012  was 3945 million  and 4401 million  

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities 

cash flow from operating activities  we generated 3478 million  4603 million  and 4297 million  of cash flow from operations in 2013  2012  and 2011  during 2013 our cash flow from operations decreased 245 percent  compared to a 300 percent  decrease in net income during the first quarter of 2013 we used 1118 million to fund the payment of income taxes primarily related to the gain recognized on the divestiture of tchek 

cash used for investing activities  we used 289 million  of cash in 2013  3591 million  of cash in 2012  and 383 million  of cash in 2011  for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions in 2012 cash received for the divestiture of tchek net of the cash we sold was 2748 million  

we used 482 million  507 million  and 528 million  of cash for capital expenditures in 2013  2012  and 2011  we spent 359 million 420 million and 398 million in 2013  2012  and 2011  primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems including the purchase and development of software these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business additionally we built a new office building on our corporate campus in eden prairie minnesota this building was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and it replaced space we previously leased in eden prairie this building cost approximately 185 million we have spent 140 million on the building through december 31 2013 we expect to fund the balance of costs to complete the building in the first quarter of 2014 

in 2012 we purchased 500 intermodal containers for 52 million and funded the balance of the 2011 container purchases in 2011 we also purchased a new corporate aircraft for 73 million and 500 intermodal containers for 48 million 

we anticipate capital expenditures in 2014 to be approximately 40 million to 50 million 

during the second quarter of 2013 we received 191 million in cash from the settlement of postclosing and working capital adjustments in accordance with the phoenix purchase agreement we used cash of 5836 million  for acquisitions in 2012 on october 1 2012 we acquired apreo for 228 million net of cash acquired on november 1 2012 we paid 5608 million in cash for phoenix net of cash acquired 

in 2011 we sold our remaining availableforsale securities which generated 93 million  of cash from investing activities 

cash used for financing activities  we used 3649 million  2643 million  and 4151 million  of cash flow for financing activities in 2013  2012  and 2011  

in 2013  and 2012  we had net shortterm borrowings of 1214 million  and 2484 million  respectively on october 29 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature of which 3750 million  was outstanding as of december 31 2013  the purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and will assist us in continuing to fund working capital capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys debt covenants as of december 31 2013  

in 2013 we had longterm borrowings of 5000 million  on august 23 2013 we entered into a note purchase agreement for 5000 million of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31 2013  the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24 2013 we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31 2013  

we used 2203 million  2754 million  and 1947 million  to pay cash dividends in 2013  2012  and 2011  the decrease in 2013 was due to a fifth quarterly dividend paid in 2012 and a lower number of shares outstanding in 2013 partially offset by an increase in the dividend rate in 2013 to 035 per share from 033 per share in 2012 the increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to a fifth quarterly dividend paid at 035 per share in december 2012 the board of directors modified the dividend payment date to be the last day of the quarter in which it is declared this is a change from the previous policy which was to pay the cash dividend on the first day of the following quarter from which the cash dividend was declared we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on the last day of the quarter for which they were declared by the board of directors additionally the rate for our first four quarterly dividends increased to 033 per share in 2012 from 029 per share in 2011 

we also used 7573 million  2451 million  and 2409 million  on share repurchases in 2013  2012  and 2011  the increase in 2013 was due to the 5000 million of shares repurchased as part of the asr agreements entered into during the third quarter of 2013 we received 61 million shares of common stock with a fair value of 3500 million during the third quarter of 2013 which represented approximately 70 percent of the total shares expected to be repurchased under the agreements in december 2013 one of the banks terminated their asr agreement and delivered 12 million shares in february 2014 the remaining asr agreement was terminated approximately 12 million shares were delivered as final settlement of the remaining agreement in august 2013 the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15000000 shares as of december 31 2013  there were 14069925  shares remaining for future repurchases the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditions 

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations the amount available under our credit facility and credit available in the market will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition  total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable  our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 393 million  as of december 31 2013  increased compared to the allowance of 346 million as of december 31 2012 this increase was primarily due to growth in our accounts receivable balance we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill  we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31 2013  

stockbased compensation  the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 18 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2013  dollars in thousands 

  



 

 we have no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable longterm notes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2013  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 215 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2013  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we had 1620 million  of cash and investments on december 31 2013  consisting entirely of cash and cash equivalents although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks 

we are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a 500 million revolving loan facility interest accrues on the revolving loan at variable rates based on libor or prime plus the applicable addon percentage as defined at december 31 2013  there was 3750 million  outstanding on the revolving loan 

we are a party to the note purchase agreement with various institutional investors with fixed rates consisting of i 175000000 of the company’s 397 percent senior notes series a due august 27 2023 ii 150000000 of the company’s 426 percent senior notes series b due august 27 2028 and iii 175000000 of the company’s 460 percent senior notes series c due august 27 2033 at december 31 2013  there was 5000 million outstanding on the notes 

a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations

overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2012 consolidated total revenues of 114 billion we are a service company we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2012 we handled approximately 115 million shipments and worked with more than 42000 active customers we operate through a network of 276 offices which we call branches in north america europe asia south america and australia we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

as a third party logistics provider we cultivate contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 56000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting 

in addition to transportation we provide sourcing services “sourcing” our sourcing business is primarily the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through our network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and merchandising we have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh produce under consumer recognized brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through our preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers 

historically we provided feebased payment services payment services primarily through our subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek tchek provided a variety of payment management and business intelligence services primarily to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors those services included funds transfer fuel purchasing and online expense management for most of these services tchek charged a fee per transaction on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of tchek to electronic funds source llc efs we expect to continue to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance option we offer our contracted carriers through continued agreements with tchek 

our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our branch network of 276 offices our branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of most branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity 

our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 43 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by growing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional salespeople we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in october 2012 we 

acquired all of the outstanding stock of the operating subsidiaries of apreo logistics sa apreo a leading freight forwarder based in warsaw poland this acquisition enhances our truckload capabilities in europe in november 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix an international freight forwarder based in chicago illinois phoenix has a strong track record and diverse customer base in the international freight forwarding industry this acquisition expanded our global forwarding network 

our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and technology processes and utilizing our network of subcontracted transportation providers including contract motor carriers railroads air freight carriers and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive subcontracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a thirdparty logistics company 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 

 

customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson branch responsible for their account the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is entered into our proprietary operating system with the help of information provided by our operating system the salesperson then selects a contracted carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different branch offices collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customers’ freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the contracted carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the cost for the transportation and the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication to meet our customers’ requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our transportation management business we are acting as a shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutually agreed upon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however if requested by the contract carrier we will estimate and report fuel separately in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customers’ warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for an allocation of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation net revenues 

  



  

 transportation services accounted for approximately 89 percent of our net revenues in 2012 88 percent of our net revenues in 2011 and 87 percent of our net revenues in 2010 

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors 

our sourcing services have expanded to include forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately eight percent of our net revenues in 2012 and 2011 and nine percent in 2010 

  

payment services 

on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the operations of tchek which represented a majority of our payment services to efs however we expect to generate payment services revenues from the cash advance option we offer our contracted carriers at a rate of approximately 3 million per quarter 

payment services accounted for approximately three percent of our net revenues in 2012 and four percent of our net revenues in 2011 and 2010 

organization 

branch network  to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices which we call “branches” we currently have 276 branches in the following areas of the world 

  



each branch is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new overtheroad contract carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa issued safety ratings 

branch employees  branch offices are responsible for their hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their branch and balancing personnel resources with their business requirements because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate recruiting group that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

early in their tenure most newlyhired branch employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive members of a branch team including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training at the branch level we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks 

employees at a branch operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch branch managers and most salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the branch within our 401k plan employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespeople for a short period of time  

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders generally these awards vest over fiveyear periods and also include performancebased requirements 

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management corporate sales and account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

shared services 

our branches are supported by our shared and centralized services approximately 14 percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers approximately 33 percent of these shared services employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had a total of 10929 employees 9432 of whom were located in our branch offices services such as accounting information technology legal marketing human resource support credit and claims management and carrier services are supported centrally 

customer relationships 

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2012 we served over 42000 active customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries 

during 2012 our largest customer accounted for approximately three percent of total revenues and approximately two percent of net revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our salespeople to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive team branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

we have also expanded our corporate sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities branches also call on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to assure dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2012 we worked with approximately 56000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances 

contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans and flatbeds these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was approximately two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2012 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2012 every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and nightly through subscriptions with a third party service we verify that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis to support future growth we have purchased 1000 53foot containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

in our nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” ocean transportation and freight forwarding business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lane requirements these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional air freight forwarder internationally and in north america we select air carriers provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments and arrange for customs clearance of shipments including the payment of duties we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 seasonality 

historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends in recent years operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters we believe this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

proprietary information technology and intellectual property 

our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2012 we executed approximately 115 million shipments for more than 42000 active customers and 56000 contract carriers 

we rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the united states and international locations 

in october we launched navisphere® a single platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with every party in their supply chain across languages currencies and continents navisphere® offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands 

the chrw trucks web based platform provides contracted carriers additional access to our systems contract carriers can access available freight perform online check calls keep track of receivables and upload scanned documentation many of our carriers favorite features from chrw trucks are also available through our chrw trucks mobile application available for android and ios mobile operating systems 

our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal mode of transportation build and consolidate shipments and identify appropriate carriers all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems provide our vast organization the necessary business intelligence to allow for real time scorecards and necessary decision support in all areas of our business 

government regulation 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as an indirect air carrier of cargo subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we source fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations 

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses but offer our customers the option to purchase shippers interest coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 200 million umbrella our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident 

as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which were generally not insured beginning in 2012 we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident

risk factors 

tableend

you should consider carefully the following cautionary statements if you own our common stock or are planning to buy our common stock we intend to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” by providing this discussion 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 

higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin  carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing 

changing fuel costs may have an impact on our net revenue margins  in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues rising fuel prices may result in a decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage declines 

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services  we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political conditions  all of our business operations are subject to the influences of significant political changes and our ability to respond to them including 

 we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks  we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these 

risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model  our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition  competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against logistics companies as well as transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations 

we are reliant on technology to operate our business  we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers we are reliant on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future because of our significant presence in the industry we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack any failure to maintain performance reliability security and availability of our products and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices  we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america europe asia south america and australia supported by executives and services in a central corporate office with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business in their branch and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry  results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations  we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident in 2010 2011 and 2012 a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently 

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination this risk is mitigated in the majority of cases where we source produce as we do not handle or package the product product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance did not cover prior to 2012 beginning in 2012 we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations  we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a property freight broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nvocc bond and by the transportation security administration as an independent air carrier we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal and state environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and or prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

a significant increase in fraud or theft could adversely affect our results  we have exposure to both internal and external fraud and theft unauthorized or fraudulent requests for advances or payment can occur a significant increase in fraudulent activity could adversely affect our results 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers  our top 100 customers comprise approximately 34 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 29 percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately three percent of our consolidated total revenues and approximately two percent of our consolidated net revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue 

equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies for acquisitions including phoenix and apreo success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  historically our longterm growth objective has been 15 percent for net revenues operating income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

we are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations for such legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses however based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

the following table represents certain statements of operations data shown as percentages of our net revenues 



overview 

our company  we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of branch offices in north america europe asia south america and australia as a third party logistics provider we cultivate contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 56000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation 

for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk 

in addition to transportation and logistics services we also offer fresh produce sourcing and feebased payment services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues historically our payment services business consisted primarily of our subsidiary tchek which provided a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors on october 16 2012 we sold substantially all of the assets and transferred certain liabilities of tchek to efs we expect to continue to generate payment services revenues of approximately 3 million per quarter from the tchek cash advance option we offer our contracted carriers 

our business model  we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply we also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the branch network based on the profitability of their individual branch office 

in addition we do not have precommitted targets for headcount our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their branch’s volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business 

our branch network  our branch network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our branch offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic 

in october 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of the operating subsidiaries of apreo logistics sa apreo a leading freight forwarder based in warsaw poland this acquisition enhances our truckload capabilities in europe in november 2012 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of phoenix international freight services ltd phoenix an international freight forwarder based in chicago illinois phoenix has a strong track record and diverse customer base in the international freight forwarding industry this acquisition expanded our global forwarding network 

our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 43 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

our people  because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount grew by 2576 employees during 2012 this was primarily due to the acquisitions of phoenix and apreo during the fourth quarter of 2012 branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of many of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between 

employees and our shareholders generally these awards vest over fiveyear periods and also include performancebased requirements in 2012 we also issued restricted equity awards that vest evenly over five years starting on december 31 2013 

our customers  in 2012 we worked with more than 42000 active customers up from approximately 37000 in 2011 we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated our top 100 customers represented approximately 34 percent of our total revenues and approximately 29 percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately 34 percent of our total revenues and approximately 22 percent of our total net revenues 

our contracted carriers  our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2012 our carrier base was approximately 56000 up from approximately 53000 in 2011 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2012 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacity 

our goals  since we became a publiclytraded company in 1997 our longterm compounded annual growth goal has been 15 percent for net revenues income from operations and earnings per share although there have been periods where we have not achieved these goals over the period since 1997 we have exceeded this compounded growth goal in all three categories our expectation is that over time we will continue to achieve our longterm goal of 15 percent growth but that we will have periods in which we exceed that goal and periods in which we fall short we expect to reach our longterm growth primarily through internal growth but acquisitions that fit our growth criteria and culture may also augment our growth 

2012 compared to 2011 

total revenues and direct costs  our consolidated total revenues increased 99 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 total transportation revenues increased 108 percent to 969 billion in 2012 from 874 billion in 2011 this increase was driven by higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and increased pricing to our customers including the impacts of higher fuel costs total purchased transportation and related services increased 118 percent in 2012 to 816 billion from 730 billion in 2011 this increase was due to higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and higher transportation costs including the impacts of higher fuel costs our sourcing revenue increased 55 percent to 162 billion in 2012 from 154 billion in 2011 purchased products sourced for resale increased 54 percent in 2012 to 148 billion from 141 billion in 2011 these increases were primarily due to higher case volumes our payment services revenue decreased 112 percent to 535 million in 2012 from 603 million in 2011 the decrease was due to the sale of substantially all of our payment services business tchek to electronic funds source llc on october 16 2012 

net revenues  total transportation net revenues increased 58 percent to 153 billion in 2012 from 144 billion in 2011 our transportation net revenue margin decreased to 158 percent in 2012 from 165 percent in 2011 largely driven by higher transportation costs and higher fuel costs partially offset by an increase in transportation rates charged to our customers while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough in our truckload business therefore in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage decreases as it did in 2012 

truck net revenues which consist of truckload and ltl services comprise approximately 75 percent of our total net revenues our truck net revenues increased 39 percent to 128 billion in 2012 from 124 billion in 2011 truckload volumes increased approximately ten percent in 2012 truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2012 due to increased cost of capacity and an increase in fuel prices partially offset by increased rates charged to our customers excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel on average our truckload rates increased approximately one percent in 2012 our truckload transportation costs increased approximately two percent excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel 

during 2012 our ltl net revenues increased approximately 13 percent the increase was driven primarily by an increase in shipment volumes and increased pricing to our customers partially offset by increased cost of capacity our ltl volumes increased approximately 16 percent compared to 2011 

our intermodal net revenue decrease of 58 percent to 388 million in 2012 from 412 million in 2011 was driven largely by increased cost of capacity 

our ocean transportation net revenues increased 270 percent to 849 million in 2012 from 669 million in 2011 this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of phoenix on november 1 2012 

our air transportation net revenues increase of 129 percent in 2012 was driven by our acquisition of phoenix 

other logistics services net revenues which include transportation management services customs warehousing and small parcel increased 264 percent to 757 million in 2012 from 599 million in 2011 this increase was primarily due to transaction increases in our transportation management and customs services we estimate that phoenix contributed approximately 6 percent to the growth in other logistics services net revenues during 2012 

sourcing net revenues increased 62 percent to 1364 million in 2012 from 1284 million in 2011 this increase was primarily due to increased volumes and a slight increase in net revenue per case our net revenue margin remained at 84 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 

payment services was comprised primarily of revenue related to our subsidiary tchek payment services net revenues decreased 121 percent to 530 million in 2012 from 603 million in 2011 the decrease was due to the tchek divestiture on october 16 2012 we have recorded a gain of 2816 million related to this divestiture in 2012 we expect to continue to generate payment services revenues of approximately 3 million per quarter from the tchek cash advance option we offer our contracted carriers 

operating expenses  operating expenses increased 109 percent to 104 billion in 2012 from 9399 million in 2011 this was due to an increase of 100 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 134 percent in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses increased to 607 percent in 2012 from 576 percent in 2011 this increase was primarily due to increased personnel and other selling general and administrative expenses incurred because of our acquisitions and divestitures in 2012 

our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth in 2012 personnel expenses increased to 7660 million from 6962 million in 2011 our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2012 to 446 percent from 426 percent in 2011 these increases were primarily due to an increase in vesting expense of 330 million of our equity awards triggered by the gain on the divestiture of tchek in 2012 our average headcount increased approximately 136 percent due primarily to the acquisitions of apreo and phoenix personnel expenses related to our various incentive plans are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability 

other selling general and administrative expenses increased 134 percent to 2762 million in 2012 from 2437 million in 2011 approximately 106 million of this increase is related to investment banking and other external legal and accounting fees paid for the acquisitions and divestitures in 2012 the remaining increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in travel amortization of intangible assets acquired temporary services and warehouse expenses partially offset by a reduction in claims 

income from operations  income from operations decreased 25 percent to 6753 million in 2012 from 6927 million in 2011 income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 393 percent in 2012 from 424 percent in 2011 these decreases were primarily related to the increases in operating expenses offset partially by an increase in net revenues

during 2011 our ltl net revenues increased approximately 27 percent the increase was driven primarily by an increase in shipment volumes and increased pricing to our customers our ltl volumes increased approximately 15 percent compared to 2010 

our intermodal net revenue increase of 127 percent to 412 million in 2011 from 366 million in 2010 was driven largely by volume and pricing increases partially offset by lower margins our intermodal net revenue margin declined in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher transportation costs 

our ocean transportation net revenues increased 101 percent to 669 million in 2011 from 608 million in 2010 due primarily to volume increases we experienced a net revenue margin increase due to decreased cost of capacity 

our air transportation net revenues decrease of 70 percent in 2011 was driven by decreased volumes and decreased pricing our air net revenue margins decreased in 2011 due to increased cost of capacity partially offset by increased pricing to our customers

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock in 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and it will allow us to continue to fund working capital capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases cash and cash equivalents totaled 2100 million and 3737 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled 1033 million and 618 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 working capital at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 4401 million and 7349 million 

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions to redeploy our cash but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities we continue to invest our cash with a focus on principal preservation our current interestbearing cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash holdings and municipal money market funds our investment income related to cash and cash equivalents is down compared to last year due to the changes in the overall market yields of highquality shortterm investments 

cash flow from operating activities  we generated 4603 million 4297 million and 3448 million of cash flow from operations in 2012 2011 and 2010 during 2012 our cash flow from operations increased 71 percent compared to a 376 percent increase in net income the increase in our net income was primarily a result of the gain recognized net of tax on the divestiture of tchek

we used 507 million 528 million and 287 million of cash for capital expenditures in 2012 2011 and 2010 we spent 420 million 398 million and 287 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems including the purchase and development of software these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business 

in 2012 we purchased 500 intermodal containers for 52 million and funded the balance of the 2011 container purchases in 2011 we also purchased a new corporate aircraft for 73 million and 500 intermodal containers for 48 million 

we anticipate capital expenditures in 2013 to be approximately 55 million to 60 million 

we used cash of 5836 million for acquisitions in 2012 on october 1 2012 we acquired apreo for 228 million net of cash acquired on november 1 2012 we paid 5608 million in cash for phoenix net of cash acquired 

in 2011 we sold our remaining availableforsale securities which generated 93 million of cash from investing activities during 2010 we sold nearly all of our availableforsale securities and invested in cash and cash equivalents which generated 424 million of cash from investing activities 

cash used for financing activities  we used 2643 million 4151 million and 2891 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2012 2011 and 2010 

in 2012 we had net borrowings of 2536 million on october 29 2012 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to 500 million with a 500 million accordion feature which expires on october 29 2017 the purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and will allow us to continue to fund working capital capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization as measured at the end of each quarter and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances in addition there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys debt covenants as of december 31 2012 

we used 2754 million 1947 million and 1689 million to pay cash dividends in 2012 2011 and 2010 the increase in 2012 was due primarily to a fifth quarterly dividend paid at 035 per share in december 2012 the board of directors modified the dividend payment date to be the last day of the quarter in which it is declared this is a change from the previous policy which was to pay the cash dividend on the first day of the following quarter from which the cash dividend was declared going forward in 2013 we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on the last day of the quarter for which they were declared by the board of directors additionally the rate for our first four quarterly dividends increased to 033 per share in 2012 from 029 per share in 2011 

we also used 2451 million 2409 million and 1511 million on share repurchases in 2012 2011 and 2010 the increase in 2012 was due to a 20 percent increase from the number of shares repurchased in 2011 partially offset by a 13 percent decrease in the average price per share repurchased the increase in 2011 was due primarily to a 41 percent increase from the number of shares repurchased in 2010 we are currently purchasing shares under the 2009 authorization of 10000000 shares as of december 31 2012 there were 827443 shares remaining under this authorization during the third quarter of 2012 the board of directors authorized management to repurchase an additional 10000000 shares of our common stock the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditions 

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations and the amount available under our credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition  total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage and transportation management are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable  our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 346 million as of december 31 2012 increased compared to the allowance of 313 million as of december 31 2011  this increase was due to growth in our accounts receivable balance we  believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill  we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of december 31 2012 

stockbased compensation  the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts have varied from 12 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards the determination of the fair value of sharebased awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2012 dollars in thousands 

  



 

 we have no capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 206 million   of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2012 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we had 2100 million of cash and investments on december 31 2012 consisting entirely of cash and cash equivalents although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks 

we are a party to a credit agreement with various lenders consisting of a 500 million revolving loan facility interest accrues on the revolving loan at variable rates based on libor or prime plus the applicable addon percentage as defined at december 31 2012 there was 2530 million outstanding on the revolving loan 

a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations

 item 1 business tableend overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2011 consolidated total revenues of 103 billion we are a service company we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2011 we handled approximately 10 million shipments and worked with more than 37000 active customers we operate through a network of 235 offices which we call branches in north america europe asia south america australia and the middle east we have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

as a third party logistics provider we cultivate contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight we have contractual relationships with approximately 53000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting 

in addition to transportation and logistics services we provide sourcing services “sourcing” and feebased payment services “payment services” 

our sourcing business is primarily the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 the foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities we supply fresh produce through our network of independent produce growers and suppliers our customers include grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors in many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and merchandising we have developed proprietary brands of produce including the fresh 1 ®  tomorrow’s ® organics rosemont farms ®  and melon up ®  we also have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh produce under consumer recognized brand names such as tropicana ®  welch’s ®  mott’s ®  and glory ® foods the produce for these brands is sourced through our preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers 

payment services is comprised of a ch robinson subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek tchek provides a variety of payment management and business intelligence services primarily to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors those services include funds transfer fuel purchasing and online expense management 

our business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our branch network of 235 offices staffed by approximately 6300 salespeople these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity 

  

our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 40 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by growing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional salespeople we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions 

our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supplychain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and technology processes and utilizing our network of subcontracted transportation providers including contract motor carriers railroads air freight carriers and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive subcontracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a thirdparty logistics company 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the ch robinson branch responsible for their account customers communicate with us by means of telephone fax internet email or electronic data interchange edi the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is entered into our proprietary operating system with the help of information provided by our operating system the salesperson then selects a contracted carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different branch offices collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customers’ freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the contracted carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the cost for the transportation and the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication including edi our proprietary website chrwtrucks ® wwwchrwtruckscom email fax telephone and mobile applications to meet our customers’ requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our transportation management business we are acting as a shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and therefore allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutuallyagreed upon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however if requested by the contract carrier we will estimate and report fuel separately in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customers’ warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation 

  

services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 in item 8 for an allocation of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation net revenues 

 

  

 transportation services accounted for approximately 88 percent of our net revenues in 2011 87 percent of our net revenues in 2010 and 88 percent of our net revenues in 2009 

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors 

our sourcing services have expanded to include forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately eight percent of our net revenues in 2011 and nine percent in 2010 and 2009 

  

payment services 

tchek’s customers are primarily motor carriers and truck fuel distributors tchek provides its customers with fuel management services funds transfer spend management reporting driver payroll services permits and online access to customized business intelligence all through the use of its proprietary automated systems these systems enable customers to track and manage certain expenses including fuel and maintenance for several companies and fuel distributors tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

payment services accounted for approximately four percent of our net revenues in 2011 and 2010 and three percent of our net revenues in 2009 

organization 

branch network to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices which we call “branches” we currently have 235 branches 

we have branches in the following areas of the world 

 

 each branch is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new contract carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable safety ratings 

branch expansion we expect to continue to open new branch offices new branch offices are viewed as a longterm contributor to overall company growth in addition to market opportunity a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch a modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space communications and hardware and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time we have also augmented our branch office network through selective acquisitions 

branch employees branch offices are responsible for their hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their branch and balancing personnel resources with their business requirements because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring to support our hiring processes we have a corporate recruiting group that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

  

early in their tenure most newlyhired branch employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the skills including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy necessary to become productive members of a branch team centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training at the branch level we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks 

employees at a branch operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the branch within our 401k plan employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespeople for a short period of time  

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan this plan includes restricted stock and restricted stock units as our primary equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders in 2011 our restricted share recipients received a portion of their equity awards as performancebased stock options most restricted equity awards vest over a period of up to five calendar years based on the company’s earnings growth 

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management corporate sales and account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

shared services 

our branches are supported by our corporate executives and shared services approximately 15 percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers approximately 31 percent of these shared services employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had a total of 8353 employees 7092 of whom were located in our branch offices services such as accounting information technology legal marketing human resource support credit and claims management and carrier services are supported centrally 

customer relationships 

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2011 we served over 37000 active customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries 

  

during 2011 our largest customer accounted for approximately four percent of total revenues and approximately two percent of net revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of the marketplace and the range of value of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our salespeople to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive team branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

we have also expanded our corporate sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities branches also call on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to assure dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2011 we worked with approximately 53000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances through our tchek subsidiary 

contracted motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was approximately two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2011 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2011 every motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and periodically thereafter we verify that each motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we have entered into a two year lease for 348 containers through our relationship with a class 1 railroad to support future growth in 2011 we purchased 500 53foot containers we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

  

in our nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” ocean transportation and freight forwarding business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lane requirements these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional air freight forwarder internationally and in north america we select air carriers provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments and arrange for customs clearance of shipments including the payment of duties we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

the primary business of our payment services business is fuel card services the fuel card processing industry is very consolidated and a small number of companies represent the majority of the market 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

proprietary information technology 

our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2011 our proprietary information systems helped our employees efficiently handle approximately 10 million shipments more than 37000 active customer relationships and 53000 contract carrier relationships our employees are linked with each other and with our customers carriers and suppliers by telephone fax internet email andor edi to communicate shipment requirements and availability and to confirm and bill orders 

our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate shipments and identify appropriate carriers all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems also make shipment data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and contracted carriers enabling our salespeople to select contracted carriers and track shipments in progress our systems also provide performance and productivity reports that our managers and executives can use to more efficiently manage our business 

through our internet sites chrwonline ® wwwchrwonlinecom and chrwtrucks ®  customers and contracted carriers can contract for shipments or equipment as well as track and trace shipments including delivery confirmation customers contracted carriers and suppliers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the internet our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers and contracted carriers these reports provide them with information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and support analysis of their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute costs 

government regulation 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as an indirect air carrier of cargo subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we source fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations are subject to federal and state regulations including but not limited to the bank secrecy act of 1970 

  

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses but offer our customers the option to purchase shippers interest coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 200 million umbrella in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 

as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which were generally not insured beginning in 2012 we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary and licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following cautionary statements if you own our common stock or are planning to buy our common stock we intend to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” by providing this discussion we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results except to the extent required by law 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 

  

  

  

  

   

higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing 

changing fuel costs may have an impact on our net revenue margins in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues rising fuel prices may result in a decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage declines 

our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers’ freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims in addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

 we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political conditions all of our business operations are subject to the influences of significant political changes and our ability to respond to them including 

 

  

  

 we may be subject to negative impacts of natural disasters 

our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

  

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against logistics companies as well as transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations 

we are reliant on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers we are reliant on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner computer viruses could cause an interruption to the availability of our systems unauthorized access to our systems with malicious intent could result in the theft of proprietary information and in systems outages an unplanned systems outage or unauthorized access to our systems could materially and adversely affect our business 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america europe asia south america australia and the middle east supported by executives and services in a central corporate office with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business in their branch and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our 

  

automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident in 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently 

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million in 2010 2011 and 2012 for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance did not cover prior to 2012 beginning in 2012 we carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million this policy has a retention of 5 million per incident any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a property freight broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nvocc bond and by the transportation security administration as an independent air carrier we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal and state environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and or prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

  

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

a significant increase in fraud or theft could adversely affect our results we have exposure to both internal and external fraud and theft particularly with regard to our operations of tchek unauthorized or fraudulent requests for advances or payment can occur a significant increase in fraudulent activity could adversely affect our results 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers our top 100 customers comprise approximately 34 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 30 percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises 36 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 23 percent of our consolidated net revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all if we acquire a company we may have difficulty integrating its businesses products services technologies and personnel into our operations acquired companies or operations may have unexpected liabilities and we may face challenges in retaining significant customers of acquired companies these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price historically our longterm growth objective has been 15 percent for net revenues operating income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend results of operations 

the following table illustrates our net revenue margins by services and products 

 

 the following table summarizes our net revenues by service line 

 

 the following table represents certain statements of operations data shown as percentages of our net revenues 

 

 overview 

our company we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of branch offices in north america europe asia south america australia and the middle east as a third party logistics provider we cultivate contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers’ freight we 

  

have contractual relationships with approximately 53000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment our model enables us to be flexible provide solutions that optimize service for our customers and minimize our asset utilization risk 

in addition to transportation and logistics services we also offer fresh produce sourcing and feebased payment services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues our payment services business is our subsidiary tchek which provides a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors those services include funds transfer fuel purchasing and online expense management 

our business model we are primarily a service company we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spot market basis we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply we also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the branch network based on the profitability of their individual branch office 

in addition we do not have precommitted targets for headcount our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their branch’s volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business 

our branch network our branch network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our branch offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is marketdriven and very dynamic 

our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs as an example approximately 40 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches the majority of our global network operates on a common technology platform that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

  

during 2011 we increased the size of our branch network by four branches to 235 we are planning limited branch openings during 2012 because we usually open new offices with only two or three employees we do not expect them to make a material contribution to our financial results in the first few years of their operation 

our people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount grew by 725 employees during 2011 branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch we believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity in 2003 we implemented a restricted equity program to better align our key employees with the interests of our shareholders and to motivate and retain them for the long term these restricted equity awards vest over a period of up to five years based on the company’s earnings growth and have been awarded annually since 2003 

our customers in 2011 we worked with more than 37000 active customers up from approximately 36000 in 2010 we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated our top 100 customers represented approximately 34 percent of our total revenues and approximately 30 percent of our net revenues our largest customer was 36 percent of our total revenues and 23 percent of our total net revenues 

our contracted carriers our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2011 our carrier base was approximately 53000 up from approximately 49000 in 2010 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2011 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacity 

our goals since we became a publiclytraded company in 1997 our longterm compounded annual growth target has been 15 percent for net revenues income from operations and earnings per share although there have been periods where we have not achieved these goals over the period since 1997 we have exceeded this compounded growth goal in all three categories our expectation is that over time we will continue to achieve our longterm target of 15 percent growth but that we will have periods in which we exceed that goal and periods in which we fall short we expect to reach our longterm growth primarily through internal growth but acquisitions that fit our growth criteria and culture may also augment our growth 

during 2011 our consolidated total revenues increased 115 percent due primarily to volume increases in many of our modes of transportation and increasing transportation rates transportation rates increased primarily due to a rise in fuel prices and increased pricing to our customers our pricing exclusive of fuel increased due to an increase in overall transportation market demand 

we did not achieve our longterm growth goals of 15 percent during 2011 our net revenues grew 112 percent to 16 billion our income from operations increased 112 percent to 6927 million and our diluted earnings per share increased 124 percent to 262 during 2011 our net revenue margins net revenues as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 158 percent compared to 2010

total revenues and direct costs our consolidated total revenues increased 115 percent in 2011 compared to 2010 total transportation revenues increased 154 percent to 874 billion in 2011 from 758 billion in 2010 this increase was driven by higher volumes in many of our transportation modes and increased pricing to our customers including the impacts of higher fuel costs total purchased transportation services increased 158 percent in 2011 to 730 billion from 630 billion in 2010 this increase was due to higher volumes in many of

other selling general and administrative expenses increased 144 percent to 2437 million in 2011 from 2131 million in 2010 the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily related to an increase in claims travel temporary services and depreciation partially offset by a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts

our ocean transportation net revenues increased 121 percent to 608 million in 2010 from 542 million in 2009 due primarily to significant volume increases we experienced a net revenue margin decline due to increased cost of capacity which was partially offset by increased pricing to our customers excluding our previously disclosed acquisition of walker logistics overseas ltd “walker” on june 12 2009 our ocean transportation net revenues would have increased approximately nine percent

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock cash and cash equivalents totaled 3737 million and 3986 million as of december 31 2011 and 2010 as of december 31 2011 we did not have any availableforsale securities availableforsale securities consisting primarily of highly liquid investments totaled 93 million as of december 31 2010 working capital at december 31 2011 and 2010 was 7349 million and 7102 million 

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions to redeploy our cash but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities we continue to invest our cash with a focus on principal preservation our current interestbearing cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash holdings and municipal money market funds our investment income related to cash and cash equivalents is down compared to last year due to the changes in the overall market yields of highquality shortterm investments 

cash flow from operating activities we generated 4297 million 3448 million and 3726 million of cash flow from operations in 2011 2010 and 2009 during 2011 our cash flow from operations increased 246 percent compared to an 115 percent increase in net income 

cash used for investing activities we used 383 million of cash in 2011 generated 86 million of cash in 2010 and used 1239 million of cash in 2009 for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures cash paid for acquisitions and investing in securities 

we used 528 million 287 million and 345 million of cash for capital expenditures in 2011 2010 and 2009 we spent 398 million 287 million and 206 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems including the purchase and development of software these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business 

in 2011 we also purchased a new corporate aircraft for 73 million and 500 intermodal containers for 48 million we spent 139 million in 2009 on facilities on our new corporate campus in eden prairie mn 

we anticipate capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately 40 million to 45 million 

  

we used cash of 411 million for acquisitions in 2009 on june 12 2009 we acquired walker on july 7 2009 we acquired itc and on september 15 2009 we acquired rosemont 

in 2011 we exited the remaining availableforsale securities which generated 93 million of cash from investing activities during 2010 we exited nearly all of our availableforsale securities and invested in cash and cash equivalents which generated 424 million of cash from investing activities in 2009 we used 485 million in net purchases and salesmaturities of availableforsale securities 

cash used for financing activities we used 4151 million 2891 million and 4021 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2011 2010 and 2009 this was primarily quarterly dividends and share repurchases 

we used 1947 million 1689 million and 1629 million to pay cash dividends in 2011 2010 and 2009 the increase in 2011 was due to a 16 percent increase in our quarterly dividend rate to 029 per share from 025 per share in 2010 

we also used 2409 million 1511 million and 2669 million on share repurchases in 2011 2010 and 2009 the increase in 2011 was due primarily to a 41 percent increase from the number of shares repurchased in 2010 the decrease in 2010 was due to a 51 percent decrease from the number of shares repurchased in 2009 we are currently purchasing shares under the 2009 authorization of 10000000 shares as of december 31 2011 there were 5064998 shares remaining under this authorization the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditions 

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have credit risk we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

  

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management and all transactions in payment services are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 313 million as of december 31 2011 increased compared to the allowance of 309 million as of december 31 2010 we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis in the case where we have an acquisition that we feel has not yet become integrated into our branch network component we will evaluate the impairment of any goodwill related to that specific acquisition and its results the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of december 31 2011 

stockbased compensation the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts have varied from 12 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards the determination of the fair value of sharebased awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2011 dollars in thousands 

 

  

  we have no longterm debt or capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable contingent purchase price related to acquisitions and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2011 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 105 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes our obligations for payment of contingent purchase price 

  

related to acquisitions have been excluded from the table above as the timing and exact amount of cash payment is uncertain therefore 131 million of contingent purchase price related to acquisitions have been excluded from the table above the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2011 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we had 3737 million of cash and investments on december 31 2011 consisting entirely of cash and cash equivalents although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations

our business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our branch network of 231 offices staffed by approximately 5900 salespeople these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative 

  

approximately 37 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches our north american branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

we are a service company we act primarily to add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by growing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding our relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional salespeople we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions 

multimodal transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supplychain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and technology processes and utilizing our network of subcontracted transportation providers including contract motor carriers railroads air freight carriers and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive subcontracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a thirdparty logistics company 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the branch responsible for their account customers communicate with us by means of telephone fax internet email or electronic data interchange edi the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is entered into our proprietary operating system with the help of information provided by the operating system the salesperson then selects a contracted carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different branch offices collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customers’ freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the contracted carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the price for the transportation and the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication including edi our proprietary website chrwtrucks ® wwwchrwtruckscom email fax and telephone to meet our customers’ requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our transportation management business we are acting as a shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and therefore allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

we purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutuallyagreed upon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however if requested by the contract carrier we will estimate and report fuel separately in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the 

  

nuances of their supply chains we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customers’ current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customers’ warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting feebased transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become key providers to our customers responsible for helping them manage a greater portion of their supply chains we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 in item 8 for an allocation of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2010 and 2009 in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation net revenues 

 

  

 transportation services accounted for approximately 87 percent of our net revenues in 2010 and 88 percent of our net revenues in 2009 and 2008 

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

our sourcing customer base includes large multistore grocery retailers restaurant chains and foodservice providers and growers 

  

our sourcing services have expanded to include forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately nine percent of our net revenues in 2010 and 2009 and eight percent in 2008 

information services 

tchek’s customers are primarily motor carriers and truck stop chains tchek provides its customers with fuel management services funds transfer spend management reporting driver payroll services permits and online access to customized business intelligence all through the use of its proprietary automated systems these systems enable customers to track and manage certain expenses including fuel and maintenance for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

information services accounted for approximately four percent of our net revenues in 2010 three percent of our net revenues in 2009 and four percent in 2008 

organization 

branch network to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices which we call “branches” we currently have 231 branches 

we have branches in the following areas of the world 

 

 each branch is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and third party sources such as industry directories salespeople 

  

are also responsible for recruiting new contract carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable safety ratings 

branch expansion we expect to continue to open new branch offices new branch offices are viewed as a longterm contributor to overall company growth in addition to market opportunity a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch additional branches are sometimes opened within a geographic area previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch a modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space communications and hardware and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time we have also augmented our branch office network through selective acquisitions 

branch employees because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our hiring our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

early in their tenure most newlyhired branch employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the necessary skills including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training at the branch level we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks 

employees at a branch operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the branch employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our 401k plan in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespeople for a short period of time  

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan within that plan in 2003 we began regularly issuing restricted stock and restricted stock units as our primary equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders for most restricted equity awards restricted stock and units are available to vest over five calendar years based on the company’s earnings growth 

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management corporate sales and large account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

shared services 

our branches are supported by our corporate executives and shared services approximately 15 percent of our employees are corporate employees who provide shared services in centralized centers approximately 28 percent of these corporate employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network 

  

executive officers 

under our decentralized business structure branch managers while retaining autonomy for their branch performance receive guidance and support from the executives at our central corporate office these executives provide training and education develop new services and applications to be offered to customers analyze and monitor branch productivity and performance metrics share operations and management guidance and provide broad market analysis

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had a total of 7628 employees 6493 of whom were located in our branch offices services such as accounting information technology legal marketing human resource support credit and claims management and carrier services are supported centrally 

customer relationships 

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2010 we served over 36000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2010 our largest customer accounted for approximately five percent of total revenues and approximately three percent of net revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of the marketplace and the range of value of logistics services that we can provide we believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our salespeople to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of our executive team branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

we have also expanded our corporate sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities branches also call on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to assure dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we do not own any transportation equipment or employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

in 2010 we worked with approximately 49000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our salespeople 

  

regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of prompt payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances through our tchek subsidiary 

these contracted motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was less than one percent of our total cost of transportation in 2010 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2010 every carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and periodically thereafter we verify that each carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis we have entered into a two year lease for 300 containers through our relationships with one of the class 1 railroads we believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers 

in our nonvessel operating common carrier “nvocc” ocean transportation and freight forwarding business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers specific trade lane requirements and anticipated growth in the international shipping marketplace these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

we operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional air freight forwarder internationally and in north america we determine routing select air carriers provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments and arrange for customs clearance of shipments including the payment of duties we execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period the contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

  

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

the primary business of our information services business is fuel card services the fuel card processing industry is very consolidated and a small number of companies represent the majority of the market 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 proprietary information technology 

our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business in 2010 our proprietary information systems helped our employees efficiently handle more than 92 million shipments 36000 customer relationships and 49000 contract carrier relationships our employees are linked with each other and with our customers carriers and suppliers by telephone fax internet email andor edi to communicate shipment requirements and availability and to confirm and bill orders 

our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities communicate and coordinate activity with other branches and “crosscover” or find equipment for other branches’ freight our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate shipments and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems also make shipment data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and contracted carriers enabling our salespeople to select contracted carriers and track shipments in progress our systems automatically provide alerts to arising problems our systems also provide performance and productivity reports that our managers and executives can use to more efficiently manage our business 

through our internet sites chrwonline ® wwwchrwonlinecom and chrwtrucks ®  customers and contracted carriers can contract for shipments or equipment as well as track and trace shipments including delivery 

  

confirmation customers contracted carriers and suppliers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the internet our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers and contracted carriers these reports provide them with information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and support analysis of their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute costs 

government regulation 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as an indirect air carrier of cargo subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we source fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations are subject to federal and state regulations including but not limited to the bank secrecy act of 1970 

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including 

  

automobile and general liability with a 200 million umbrella in 2008 2009 and 2010 our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 3 million per incident for 2008 and 5 million per incident in 2009 2010 and 2011 

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which are generally not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary and licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following cautionary statements if you own our common stock or are planning to buy our common stock we intend to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” by providing this discussion we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results except to the extent required by law 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 

  

  

  

  

 higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing 

changing fuel costs may have an impact on our net revenue margins in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues rising fuel prices may result in a decreased net revenue margin while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our business in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage declines 

we depend upon others to provide equipment and services we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers’ freight and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the 

  

freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims this reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

 we have international operations we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against logistics companies as well as transportation providers that own their own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers and carriers offering 

  

logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces in addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations 

we are reliant on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers we are reliant on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner computer viruses could cause an interruption to the availability of our systems unauthorized access to our systems with malicious intent could result in the theft of proprietary information and in systems outages an unplanned systems outage or unauthorized access to our systems could materially and adversely affect our business 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america europe asia south america australia and the middle east supported by executives and services in a central corporate office with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business in their branch and adherence to applicable local laws our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition some of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 3 million per incident for 2008 and 5 million per incident in 2009 2010 and 2011 a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our 

  

operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently 

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million in 2009 2010 and 2011 for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance does not cover any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nvocc bond and by the transportation security administration as an independent air carrier we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal and state environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and or prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers our top 100 customers comprise approximately 33 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 28 percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately five percent of our consolidated total revenues and three percent of our consolidated net revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

  

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all if we acquire a company we may have difficulty integrating its businesses products services technologies and personnel into our operations acquired companies or operations may have unexpected liabilities and we may face challenges in retaining significant customers of acquired companies these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price historically our longterm growth objective has been 15 percent for net revenues operating income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on march 20 2009 at the conclusion of a trial in illinois state court twelfth judicial circuit circuit court of will county a jury entered a verdict of 2375 million against us a federally authorized motor carrier with which we contracted and the motor carrier’s driver the award was entered in favor of three named plaintiffs following a consolidated trial stemming from an accident that occurred on april 1 2004 the motor carrier and the driver both admitted that at the time of the accident the driver was acting as an agent for the motor carrier and that the load was being transported according to the terms of our contract with the motor carrier our contract clearly defined the motor carrier as an independent contractor the verdict has the effect of holding us vicariously liable for the damages caused by the admitted negligence of the motor carrier and its driver there were no claims that our selection or retention of the motor carrier was negligent 

given our prior experience with claims of this nature we believe the court erred in allowing these claims to be considered by a jury as a result we are vigorously pursuing all available legal avenues by which we may obtain relief from the verdict we have sought relief from the verdict in the appellate court of illinois third judicial district the appellate court heard oral arguments in this case on january 19 2011 and a decision is expected to be issued during 2011 

under the terms of the insurance program which we had in place in 2004 we would be responsible for the first 50 million of claims of this nature plus post judgment interest on that amount because there are multiple potential outcomes many of which are reasonably possible but none of which we believe is probable we have not recorded a liability for this claim at this time 

we are not subject to any other pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations none of which is currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

overview 

our company we are a global provider of multimodal transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of branch offices in north america europe asia south america australia and the middle east we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers’ freight we work with approximately 49000 transportation companies worldwide and through those relationships we select and hire the appropriate transportation providers to meet our customers’ needs as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of value added logistics services such as supply chain analysis freight consolidation core carrier program management and information reporting 

in addition to multimodal transportation services we also offer fresh produce sourcing and feebased information services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in some cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues our information services business is our subsidiary tchek which provides a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors those services include funds transfer fuel purchasing and online expense management 

our business model we are a service company we act primarily to add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spotmarket basis we buy most of our transportation capacity and produce on a spotmarket basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply we also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the branch network based on the profitability of their individual branch office 

in addition we do not have precommitted targets for headcount our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their branch’s volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business 

our branch network our branch network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our branch offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is so dynamic and marketdriven 

our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers approximately 37 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches for many of our significant customer relationships we coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations 

  

to deliver specific geographic or modal needs in addition our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches our north american branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

during 2010 we decreased the size of our branch network by four branches to 231 we combined four branches with existing branches we are planning limited branch openings during 2011 because we usually open new offices with only two or three employees we do not expect them to make a material contribution to our financial results in the first few years of their operation 

our people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business our headcount grew by 281 employees during 2010 branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative in 2003 we implemented a restricted stock program to better align our key employees with the interests of our shareholders and to motivate and retain them for the long term these restricted stock awards vest over a fiveyear period based on the company’s earnings growth and have been awarded annually since 2003 

our customers in 2010 we worked with more than 36000 customers up from approximately 35000 in 2009 we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse our top 100 customers represented approximately 33 percent of our total revenues and approximately 28 percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately five percent of our total revenues and approximately three percent of our total net revenues 

our contracted carriers our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2010 our carrier base was approximately 49000 up from approximately 47000 in 2009 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2010 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately one percent of our contracted carrier capacity 

our goals since we became a publiclytraded company in 1997 our longterm compounded annual growth target has been 15 percent for net revenues income from operations and earnings per share although there have been periods where we have not achieved these goals since 1997 we have exceeded this compounded growth goal in all three categories our expectation is that over time we will continue to achieve our longterm target of 15 percent growth but that we will have periods in which we exceed that goal and periods in which we fall short we expect to reach our longterm growth primarily through internal growth but acquisitions that fit our growth criteria and culture may also augment our growth 

during 2010 our consolidated total revenues increased 224 percent due primarily to volume increases in all of our modes of transportation and increasing transportation rates transportation rates increased primarily due to a rise in fuel prices and increased pricing to our customers our pricing exclusive of fuel increased due to an increase in overall transportation market demand historically our net revenue margins have typically expanded and contracted based on fuel prices and the balance between demand and overall supply of capacity 

due to net revenue margin compression we did not achieve our longterm growth goal of 15 percent during 2010 our net revenues grew 62 percent to 15 billion our income from operations increased 65 percent to 6229 million and our diluted earnings per share increased 94 percent to 233 during 2010 our net revenue margins net revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 158 percent from 182 percent in 2009 net revenue margins decreased largely due to higher transportation costs and higher fuel prices partially offset by 

  

increased pricing to our customers while supply and demand variables continue to be volatile in most of our services we have much better net revenue growth momentum going into 2011 than we had the last few years  

2010 compared to 2009 

total revenues and direct costs our consolidated total revenues increased 224 percent in 2010 compared to 2009 total transportation revenues increased 268 percent to 758 billion in 2010 from 598 billion in 2009 this increase was driven by higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and increased pricing to our customers including the impacts of higher fuel costs total purchased transportation services increased 322 percent in 2010 to 630 billion from 477 billion in 2009 this increase was due to higher volumes in all of our transportation modes and higher transportation costs including the impacts of higher fuel costs our sourcing revenue increased 57 percent to 164 billion in 2010 from 156 billion in 2009 purchased products sourced for resale increased 54 percent in 2010 to 150 billion from 143 billion in 2009 these increases were primarily due to volume growth including our previously announced acquisition of rosemont farms corporation inc “rosemont” our information services revenue increased 211 percent to 555 million in 2010 from 458 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to an increase in transactions and increases in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices 

net revenues total transportation net revenues increased 54 percent to 127 billion in 2010 from 121 billion in 2009 our transportation net revenue margin decreased to 168 percent in 2010 from 202 percent in 2009 largely driven by higher transportation costs and higher fuel costs partially offset by an increase in transportation pricing to our customers while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough in our business therefore in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage decreases as it did in 2010 

truck net revenues which consist of truckload and lessthantruckload “ltl” services comprise approximately 73 percent of our total net revenues our truck net revenues increased 34 percent to 108 billion in 2010 from 104 billion in 2009 truckload volumes increased 156 percent in 2010 truckload net revenue margin decreased in 2010 due to an increase in fuel prices and increased cost of capacity offset partially by increased pricing to our customers excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel on average our truckload rates increased approximately five percent in 2010 consistent with past periods of rising transportation demand our cost of capacity rose faster than our customer rates excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel our cost of truckload capacity increased approximately nine percent 

during 2010 our ltl net revenues increased approximately 18 percent the increase was driven primarily by an increase in shipment volumes partially offset by increased cost of capacity our revenue per transaction decreased slightly our ltl volumes increased approximately 22 percent compared to 2009 our ltl net revenue margin in 2010 was down slightly compared to 2009 

our intermodal net revenue increase of 37 percent to 366 million in 2010 from 352 million in 2009 was driven largely by volume and pricing increases partially offset by lower margins our intermodal net revenue margin declined in 2010 compared to 2009 due to higher transportation costs 

our ocean transportation net revenues increased 121 percent to 608 million in 2010 from 542 million in 2009 due primarily to significant volume increases we experienced a net revenue margin decline due to increased cost of capacity which was partially offset by increased pricing to our customers excluding our previously disclosed acquisition of walker logistics overseas ltd “walker” on june 12 2009 our ocean transportation net revenues would have increased approximately nine percent 

our air transportation net revenues increase of 296 percent in 2010 was driven by increased volumes our air net revenue margins decreased in 2010 due to higher transportation costs which was partially offset by increased 

  

pricing to our customers excluding our previously disclosed acquisition of walker our air transportation net revenues would have increased approximately 28 percent 

other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of custom brokerage fees and transportation management fees the increase of 278 percent to 573 million in 2010 was driven primarily by increases in the transportation management business 

sourcing net revenues increased 84 percent to 1394 million in 2010 this increase was driven primarily by volume growth and the acquisition of rosemont our net revenue margin increased to 85 percent in 2010 from 83 percent in 2009 excluding the acquisition of rosemont sourcing net revenues decreased approximately five percent in 2010 

information services is comprised entirely of revenue related to our subsidiary tchek for 2010 information systems net revenues increased 211 percent to 555 million the increase was driven by increases in transactions and higher fuel prices as some of our merchant fees are based on a percentage of the total sale amount 

operating expenses operating expenses increased 60 percent to 8451 million in 2010 from 7971 million in 2009 this was due to an increase of 58 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 68 percent in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses decreased to 576 percent in 2010 compared to 577 percent in 2009 

in 2010 our average headcount was nearly flat compared to 2009 personnel expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability the growth in personnel expenses is primarily related to these variable incentive plans stock based compensation expense increased 742 percent to 370 million in 2010 from 213 million in 2009 our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined slightly in 2010 to 431 percent from 432 percent in 2009 

in 2010 other selling general and administrative expenses increased 68 percent to 2131 million in 2010 from 1996 million in 2009 the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses is primarily related to the acquisitions we completed in 2009 

income from operations income from operations increased 65 percent to 6229 million in 2010 income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 424 percent in 2010 from 423 percent in 2009 

investment and other income investment and other income decreased 448 percent to 12 million in 2010 compared to 23 million in 2009 our investment income is down compared to 2009 primarily due to the changes in the overall market yields on highquality shortterm investments and the decrease in our average investible cash balance throughout 2010 compared to 2009 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 380 percent for 2010 and 385 percent for 2009 the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal benefit 

net income net income increased 73 percent to 3870 million in 2010 from 3608 million in 2009 basic net income per share increased 93 percent to 235 diluted net income per share increased 94 percent to 233 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

total revenues and direct costs our consolidated total revenues decreased 117 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 total transportation revenues declined 162 percent to 598 billion in 2009 from 713 billion in 2008 total purchased transportation services declined 194 percent in 2009 to 477 billion from 592 billion in 2008 these declines were driven by falling transportation rates due primarily to a reduction in fuel prices and underlying rates during 2009 a significant decline in overall transportation market demand due to the economic recession impacted our volumes our sourcing revenue increased 112 percent to 156 billion in 2009 from 140 billion in 2008 purchased products sourced for resale increased 109 percent in 2009 to 143 billion from 129 billion in 2008 these increases were primarily due to volume growth including our previously announced acquisition of rosemont our information services revenue decreased 98 percent to 458 million in 2009 from 508 million in 2008 the decrease was driven by declines in transactions and declines in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices 

net revenues total transportation net revenues decreased 04 percent to 1208 billion in 2009 from 1212 billion in 2008 our transportation net revenue margin increased to 202 percent from 170 percent in 2008 largely driven by a decline in fuel prices and a lower cost of capacity while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough in our business therefore in times of lower fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage increases as it did in 2009 while we cannot predict what our net revenue margins will be in the future during the first half of 2009 our net revenue margins were at the high end of our historical range 

truck net revenues which consist of truckload and ltl services comprise approximately 75 percent of our total net revenues our truck net revenues increased 10 percent to 104 billion in 2009 from 103 billion in 2008 truckload volumes decreased 08 percent in 2009 but yearoveryear growth improved as the year progressed our truckload rates decreased approximately 16 percent excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel on average our truckload rates decreased approximately 5 percent in 2009 truckload net revenue margin increased in 2009 due to a reduction in fuel prices and lower cost of capacity consistent with past periods of falling transportation demand our cost of capacity fell faster than our customer rates excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel our cost of truckload capacity decreased approximately 6 percent as carriers lowered their rates 

during 2009 our ltl net revenues decreased slightly the decrease was driven by price declines and lower revenue per transaction largely offset by an increase in shipment volumes prices declined significantly due to the lower cost of fuel and decreased underlying rates our revenue per transaction also declined due to lower weight per transaction our ltl volumes increased approximately 27 percent compared to 2008 our ltl net revenue margin in 2009 was relatively consistent with 2008 

our intermodal net revenue decrease of 192 percent to 352 million from 436 million in 2008 was driven largely by price declines and volume decreases net revenue margin was relatively consistent with 2008 

our ocean transportation net revenues decreased 127 percent to 542 million in 2009 due to price and volume declines excluding our previously disclosed acquisitions of transera international holdings ltd “transera” and walker our ocean transportation net revenues would have declined approximately 21 percent net revenue margin increased significantly in 2009 compared to 2008 

our air transportation net revenues decrease of 77 percent in 2009 was driven by volume declines and price declines excluding our previously disclosed acquisitions our air transportation net revenues would have decreased approximately 15 percent 

other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of custom brokerage fees and transportation management fees the increase of 82 percent to 448 million in 2009 was driven primarily by increases in the transportation 

  

management business and by the acquisition of international trade  commerce inc “itc” offset partially by a decrease in other customs brokerage activity excluding the acquisition of itc our other logistics services net revenues increased approximately four percent in 2009 

sourcing net revenues increased 152 percent to 1286 million in 2009 this increase was driven primarily by volume growth and the acquisition of rosemont our net revenue margin increased to 83 percent in 2009 from 80 percent in 2008 excluding the acquisition of rosemont sourcing net revenues increased approximately nine percent in 2009 

information services is comprised entirely of revenue generated by our subsidiary tchek for 2009 information systems net revenues declined 98 percent to 458 million the decrease was driven by declines in transactions and by declines in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices 

operating expenses operating expenses decreased 08 percent to 7971 million in 2009 from 8034 million in 2008 this was due to a decrease of 07 percent in personnel expenses and a decrease of 10 percent in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses decreased to 577 percent in 2009 compared to 584 percent in 2008 

our compensation plans are designed to keep personnel expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability in addition to our variable compensation plans our average headcount during 2009 declined approximately three percent over 2008 which contributed to the reduction in personnel expenses of 07 percent higher health insurance costs and severance pay lessened the expense reduction related to the headcount decline our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined slightly in 2009 to 432 percent from 438 percent in 2008 

in 2009 other selling general and administrative expenses decreased 10 percent to 1996 million in 2009 from 2016 million in 2008 we had increases in some expenses including provisions for doubtful accounts and occupancy our occupancy expense increase was due primarily to the completion of our data center in eden prairie minnesota and the locations we added through acquisition these increases were offset by reductions in travel entertainment and other discretionary expenses 

income from operations income from operations increased 23 percent to 5848 million in 2009 income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 423 percent in 2009 from 416 percent in 2008 

investment and other income investment and other income decreased 669 percent to 23 million in 2008 compared to 68 million in 2008 our investment income is down significantly compared to 2008 primarily due to the changes in the overall market yields on highquality shortterm investments 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 385 percent for 2009 and 379 percent for 2008 the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal benefit 

net income net income increased 05 percent to 3608 million in 2009 from 3592 million in 2008 basic net income per share increased 14 percent to 215 diluted net income per share increased 24 percent to 213 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock cash and cash equivalents totaled 3986 million and 3373 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 short and longterm availableforsale securities consisting primarily of highly liquid investments totaled 93 million and 513 million as of december 31 2010 and 2009 working capital at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 7102 million and 5755 million 

  

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions to redeploy our cash but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities we continue to invest our cash with a focus on principal preservation our current interestbearing cash and investments are split primarily between municipal money markets and municipal bonds our investment income is down compared to last year due to the changes in the overall market yields of highquality shortterm investments and a decline in our average investible cash balance in 2010 

cash flow from operating activities we generated 3448 million 3726 million and 4476 million of cash flow from operations in 2010 2009 and 2008 during 2010 our cash flow from operations decreased 75 percent compared to a 73 percent increase in net income the primary factor that caused this decrease in 2010 was the increase in our accounts receivables balance of 170 percent to 10 billion in 2010 from 8855 million in 2009 as a result of increased volumes in late 2010 compared with 2009 

cash used for investing activities we generated 86 million of cash in 2010 used 1239 million of cash in 2009 and generated 315 million cash in 2008 for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures and investing in securities 

we used 287 million 345 million and 237 million of net capital expenditures in 2010 2009 and 2008 we spent 287 million 206 million and 181 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems including the purchase and development of software we spent 139 million and 56 million in 2009 and 2008 on facilities on our new corporate campus in eden prairie mn 

we used cash of 411 million and 597 million for acquisitions in 2009 and 2008 on june 12 2009 we acquired walker on july 7 2009 we acquired itc and on september 15 2009 we acquired rosemont the amount paid in 2008 included 502 million related to the closing of one acquisition and 95 million related to earnout payments and holdbacks from prior year acquisitions 

during 2010 we exited nearly all of our availableforsale securities and invested in cash and cash equivalents which generated 424 million of cash from investing activities in 2009 we used 485 million in net purchases and salesmaturities of availableforsale securities during 2008 we exited nearly all of our availableforsale securities and invested in cash and cash equivalents which generated 1141 million of cash from investing activities 

cash used for financing activities we used 2891 million 4021 million and 3260 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2010 2009 and 2008 this was primarily quarterly dividends and share repurchases 

we used 1689 million 1629 million and 1512 million to pay cash dividends in 2010 2009 and 2008 with the increase in 2010 due to a 4 percent increase in our quarterly dividend rate from 024 per share in 2009 to 025 per share in 2010 

we also used 1511 million 2669 million and 2008 million on share repurchases in 2010 2009 and 2008 the decrease in 2010 was due to a 51 percent decrease in the number of shares repurchased we are currently purchasing shares under the 2009 authorization of 10000000 shares as of december 31 2010 there were approximately 8605000 shares remaining under this authorization these repurchases are expected to take place over multiple years the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditions 

we had 35 million euros available under a line of credit at an interest rate of euribor plus 45 basis points this discretionary line of credit was closed on november 1 2009 

  

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have all credit risk we maintain substantially all risks and rewards we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management and all transactions in information services are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 309 million as of december 31 2010 increased compared to the allowance of 307 million as of december 31 2009 we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis in the case where we have an acquisition that we feel has not yet become integrated into our branch network component we will evaluate the impairment of any goodwill related to that specific acquisition and its results the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of december 31 2010 

stockbased compensation the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts have varied from 12 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model changes in the measured stock 

  

price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards the determination of the fair value of sharebased awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations due by period that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2010 dollars in thousands 

 

 

  

  we have no longterm debt or capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable contingent purchase price related to acquisitions and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2010 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 107 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes our obligations for payment of contingent purchase price related to acquisitions have been excluded from the table above as the timing and exact amount of cash payment is uncertain the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain we also enter into air and ocean freight and produce purchase contracts which are all shortterm in nature these liabilities have been excluded from the table as the amount of any cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2010 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we had 4079 million of cash and investments on december 31 2010 consisting of 3986 million of cash and cash equivalents and 93 million of availableforsale securities although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers all of our availableforsale securities are highquality bonds and substantially all are exempt from us federal income taxes because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations

 item 1 business tableend overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2009 consolidated total revenues of 76 billion we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2009 we handled approximately 75 million shipments for more than 35000 customers we operate through a network of 235 offices which we call branches in north america europe asia south america australia and the middle east we have developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide logistics services worldwide as a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers’ freight through our contractual relationships with approximately 47000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers we select and hire the appropriate transportation to meet our customers’ freight needs because we rely on subcontractors to transport freight we can be flexible and focus on seeking solutions that work for our customers rather than focusing on asset utilization as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as supply chain analysis freight consolidation core carrier program management and information reporting 

in addition to multimodal transportation services we have two other services fresh produce sourcing and feebased information services 

our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce it was our original business when we were founded in 1905 much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and perishable commodities we purchase fresh produce through our network of independent produce suppliers our customers include regional and national grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors in many cases we also arrange the transport of the fresh produce we sell through our contractual relationships with owners of specialized transportation equipment we have developed our own brands of produce including the fresh 1 ® and ourworld ® organics and we also have entered into licensing agreements to distribute produce under other national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures as part of our sourcing business 

information services is comprised of a ch robinson subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek tchek is a businesstobusiness provider of spend management and payment processing services tchek’s customers are primarily motor carriers and truck stop chains tchek’s platform supports open and closed loop networks that facilitate a variety of funds transfer vendor payments fuel purchasing and online expense management 

our business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our branch network of 235 offices staffed by approximately 5800 salespeople these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations approximately 32 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches our north american branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative 

we are a service company we act primarily to add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

  

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by expanding current offices opening new branch offices and hiring additional salespeople we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions on june 12 2009 we acquired the operating subsidiaries of walker logistics overseas ltd “walker” walker was a leading international freight forwarder headquartered in london england walker was a global fully integrated import and export doortodoor provider specializing in air freight ocean freight warehousing courier and logistics solutions its customers were primarily in electronics telecommunications medical sporting goods and military industries the majority of their revenues were from air and ocean freight 

on july 7 2009 we acquired certain assets of international trade  commerce inc “itc” itc was a united states customs brokerage company specializing in warehousing distribution and crossborder services between the united states and mexico itc was headquartered in laredo texas and had approximately 40 employees and staff itc provided a broad range of services facilitating customers’ international customs brokerage needs across all modes of transportation itc strengthened our ability to provide customers a seamless crossborder service package across the united states and mexico border 

on september 14 2009 we acquired certain assets of rosemont farms corporation inc a produce marketing company and an affiliated company quality logistics llc together referred to as “rosemont” a transportation provider that focused on produce transportation rosemont was headquartered in boca raton florida and had approximately 100 employees rosemont offered produce and logistics solutions to retail and foodservice customers 

multimodal transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supplychain services our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships we execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and technology processes and utilizing our network of subcontracted transportation providers including contract motor carriers railroads air freight carriers and ocean carriers we make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation provider to handle or transport the freight while industry definitions vary given our extensive subcontracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a thirdparty logistics company 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the branch salesperson responsible for their account customers communicate with us by means of telephone fax internet email or electronic data interchange edi the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is entered into our proprietary operating system with the help of information provided by the operating system the salesperson then selects a contracted carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a contracted carrier directly before setting a price in 

  

many cases employees from different branch offices collaborate to hire the appropriate contracted carrier for our customer’s freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the contracted carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the contract carrier to agree on the price for the transportation and the contract carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication including edi our proprietary website chrwtrucks®  wwwchrwtruckscom  email fax and telephone to meet our customers’ requirements as well as track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims in our transportation management business we are acting as a shipper’s agent in those cases the carrier’s contract is with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at specific rates most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and therefore allow for renegotiation as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

the majority of our truckload freight is priced to our contract carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutuallyagreed upon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however if requested by the contract carrier we will estimate and report fuel separately in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutuallyagreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customer’s warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting feebased transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become key providers to our customers responsible for helping them manage a greater portion of their supply chain we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 in item 8 for an allocation of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2009 and 2008 in the united states and in foreign locations 

  

the table below shows our net revenues by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation net revenues 

in thousands 

 

  

 transportation services accounted for approximately 88 percent of our net revenues in 2009 2008 and 2007 

sourcing 

since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

for several years we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base by focusing on large multistore grocery retailers restaurant chains and foodservice providers historically grocery retailers have relied primarily on regional or even local purchases from food wholesalers for produce sourcing and storelevel distribution as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation these methods have become inefficient our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers’ produce purchasing and provide consistent quality across regions and stores 

our sourcing services have expanded to include justintime replenishment commodity management and business analysis we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands these programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred supplier programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately nine percent of our net revenues in 2009 and eight percent in 2008 and 2007 

information services 

tchek’s customers are primarily motor carriers and truck stop chains tchek provides its customers with fuel management services funds transfer spend management reporting driver payroll services permits and online access to customized business intelligence all through the use of its proprietary automated systems these systems enable customers to track and manage certain expenses including fuel and maintenance for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

information services accounted for approximately three percent of our net revenues in 2009 and four percent in 2008 and 2007 

organization 

to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices which we call “branches” we currently have 235 branches up from 228 in 2008 our branches are supported by our corporate executives and other centralized shared services approximately 13 percent of our employees are corporate employees who provide these 

  

centralized shared services approximately 30 percent of these corporate employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network 

branch network 

we currently have branches in the following areas of the world 

 

 each branch is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and third party sources such as industry directories salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new contract carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and have acceptable safety ratings 

branch expansion we expect to continue to open new branch offices new branch offices are viewed as a longterm contributor to overall company growth in addition to market opportunity a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch additional branches are sometimes opened within a geographic area previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch a modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space communications and hardware and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time we have also augmented our branch office network through selective acquisitions 

branch employees because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our hiring our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

early in their tenure most newlyhired branch employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the necessary skills including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training at the branch level we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks 

employees at a branch operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the branch employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our 401k plan in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time  

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan within that plan in 2003 we began regularly issuing restricted stock and restricted stock units as our primary equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership 

  

and alignment between employees and our shareholders for most restricted equity awards restricted stock and units are available to vest over five calendar years based on the company’s earnings growth 

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management corporate sales and large account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

executive officers

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had a total of 7347 employees 6377 of whom were located in our branch offices services such as accounting information technology legal marketing human resource support credit and claims management and carrier services are supported centrally 

customers and marketing 

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2009 we served over 35000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2009 no customer accounted for more than seven percent of total revenues or more than approximately three percent of net revenues in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we believe that our decentralized structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries with the guidance of experienced branch managers who have an average tenure of 12 years with ch robinson branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that we can provide we have also expanded our corporate sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities branches also call on our executives and our corporate sales staff to support them in the pursuit of new business with companies that have more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to assure dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we do not own any transportation equipment or employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

as of december 31 2009 we had worked with approximately 47000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of prompt payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances through our tchek subsidiary 

these contracted motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds these contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier our largest truck transportation provider was approximately one percent of our total cost of transportation in 2009 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 75 percent of our truckload shipments in 2009 every carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract which establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor at the time the contract is executed and periodically thereafter we verify that each carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners stacktrain operators and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services 

  

and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis 

in our nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc ocean transportation and freight forwarding business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay our ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers specific trade lane requirements and anticipated growth in the international shipping marketplace these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

in our air freight forwarding business we purchase transportation services from approximately 200 air carriers through charter services block space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements are annual contracts that include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed annually or throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

the primary business of our information services business is fuel card services the fuel card processing industry is very consolidated and a small number of companies represent the majority of the market 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 communications and information systems 

our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business our proprietary information systems help our employees efficiently manage more than 75 million shipments annually 35000 customer relationships and 47000 contracted carrier relationships our employees are linked with each other and with our customers carriers and suppliers by telephone fax internet email andor edi to communicate shipment requirements and availability and to confirm and bill orders 

our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities communicate and coordinate activity with other branches and “crosscover” or find equipment for other branches’ freight our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate shipments and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems also make shipment data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and contracted carriers enabling our salespeople to select contracted carriers and track shipments 

  

in progress our systems automatically provide alerts to arising problems our systems also provide performance and productivity reports that our managers and executives can use to more efficiently manage our business 

through our internet sites chrwonline®  wwwchrwonlinecom  and chrwtrucks® wwwchrwtruckscom customers and contracted carriers can contract for shipments or equipment as well as track and trace shipments including delivery confirmation customers contracted carriers and suppliers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the internet our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers and contracted carriers these reports provide them with information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and support analysis of their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute costs 

government regulation 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc for which we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as an indirect air carrier of cargo subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we source fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations are subject to federal and state regulations including but not limited to the bank secrecy act of 1970 

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for damage to our customers’ cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 200 million umbrella in 2008 and 2009 our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 3 million per incident for 2007 and 2008 and 5 million per incident in 2009 and 2010 

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which are generally not insured any recall or allegation 

  

of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary and licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following cautionary statements if you own our common stock or are planning to buy our common stock we intend to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” by providing this discussion we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results except to the extent required by law 

economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the current economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 

   

  

  

  

 higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses and our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of higher transportation costs 

changing fuel costs may have an impact on our net revenue margins in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues rising fuel prices may result in a decreased net revenue margin when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate when we are purchasing transportation services the majority of our truckload freight is priced to our contract carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis for spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutuallyagreed upon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however we will estimate and report fuel separately if requested by the contracted carrier while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough to our business therefore in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage declines 

we depend upon others to provide equipment and services we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers freight and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims this reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

 we have international operations we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased we compete against logistics companies as well as transportation providers that own their own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations 

we are reliant on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers we are reliant on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner computer viruses could cause an interruption to the availability of our systems unauthorized access to our systems with malicious intent could result in the theft of proprietary information and in systems outages an unplanned systems outage or unauthorized access to our systems could materially and adversely affect our business 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america europe asia south america australia and the middle east supported by executives and services in a central corporate office with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions and the growth of the business in their branch our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition certain of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 3 million per incident for 2007 and 2008 and 5 million per incident in 2009 and 2010 a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we 

  

have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently 

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million in 2008 and 2009 for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance does not cover any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond and by the transportation security administration as an independent air carrier we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal and state environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and or prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers our top 100 customers comprise approximately 35 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 30 percent of consolidated net revenues our largest customer comprises approximately six percent of our consolidated total revenues and three percent of our consolidated net revenues the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all if we acquire a company we may have difficulty integrating its businesses products services technologies and personnel into our operations acquired companies or operations may have unexpected liabilities and we may face challenges in retaining significant customers of acquired companies these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price historically our longterm growth objective has been 15 percent for net revenues operating income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management 

  

administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend gender discrimination lawsuit— as we previously disclosed certain gender discrimination class claims were settled in 2006 the settlement was within our insurance coverage limits and was fully funded by insurance 

although the gender class settlement was fully funded by insurance those insurers reserved the right to seek a court ruling that a portion of the settlement was not covered under their policies and also to dispute payment of certain defense costs incurred in that litigation insurance coverage litigation between us and one of our insurance carriers concerning these issues and insurance coverage for individual lawsuits that were not part of the class settlement is pending in minnesota state court 

the settlement of the gender discrimination class claims did not include claims of putative class members who subsequently filed individual equal employment opportunity commission “eeoc” charges after the denial of class status fiftyfour of those eeoc claimants filed lawsuits fiftythree of those suits have been settled or dismissed the settlement amounts were not material to our financial position results of operations or cash flows we are vigorously defending the remaining lawsuit 

accident litigation— on march 20 2009 a jury in will county illinois entered a verdict of 2375 million against us a federally authorized motor carrier with which we contracted and the motor carrier’s driver the award was entered in favor of three named plaintiffs following a consolidated trial stemming from an accident that occurred on april 1 2004 the motor carrier and the driver both admitted that at the time of the accident the driver was acting as an agent for the motor carrier and that the load was being transported according to the terms of our contract with the motor carrier our contract clearly defined the motor carrier as an independent contractor the verdict has the effect of holding us vicariously liable for the damages caused by the admitted negligence of the motor carrier and its driver there were no claims that our selection or retention of the motor carrier was negligent 

given our prior experience with claims of this nature we believe the court erred in allowing these claims to be considered by a jury as a result we are vigorously pursuing all available legal avenues by which we may obtain relief from the verdict on september 15 2009 the trial court entered an order denying substantially all of the relief which we had requested in our posttrial motions now that the trial court has concluded its handling of the matter we are entitled to and will be seeking relief from the verdict from the illinois court of appeals 

under the terms of the insurance program which we had in place in 2004 we would be responsible for the first 50 million of claims of this nature because there are multiple potential outcomes many of which are reasonably possible but none of which we believe is probable we have not recorded a liability for this claim at this time 

we are not subject to any other pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations none of which is currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 the following table represents certain statements of operations data shown as percentages of our net revenues 

 

 overview 

our company we are a global provider of multimodal transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of branch offices in north america europe asia south america australia and the middle east we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers’ freight we work with approximately 47000 transportation companies worldwide and through those relationships we select and hire the appropriate transportation providers to meet our customers’ needs as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of value added logistics services such as supply chain analysis freight consolidation core carrier program management and information reporting 

  

in addition to multimodal transportation services we also offer fresh produce sourcing and feebased information services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers and foodservice providers in many cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies those revenues are reported as transportation revenues our information services business is our subsidiary tchek which provides a variety of management and business intelligence services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors those services include funds transfer fuel management services payments processing and permit procurement 

our business model we are a service company we act primarily to add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services including contracted motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price and services related to the products we source our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues 

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements some prices are committed to for a period of time subject to certain terms and conditions and some prices are set on a spotmarket basis we buy most of our transportation capacity and produce on a spotmarket basis because of this our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply we also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation is performanceoriented and for most employees in the branch network based on the profitability of their individual branch office 

in addition we do not have precommitted targets for headcount our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their branch’s volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business 

our branch network our branch network is a competitive advantage building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our branch offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is so dynamic and marketdriven 

our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers approximately 32 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches for many of our significant customer relationships we coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs in addition our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches our north american branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

during 2009 we increased the size of our branch network by seven branches to 235 we opened five new branches combined two branches with existing branches and added four branches through acquisition we are planning limited branch openings during 2010 because we usually open new offices with only two or three employees we do not expect them to make a material contribution to our financial results in the first few years of their operation 

our people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business because of the significant reduction in overall transportation demand in the marketplace during 2009 some of our branches and corporate functions adjusted their staffing levels to better match our current level of business our headcount decreased by 614 employees during 2009 the majority of the headcount decrease occurred in the first quarter of 2009 we believe the personnel adjustments made during the period were appropriate to balance our current shipment volumes and workloads with our staffing levels while leaving us with sufficient resource flexibility to continue to aggressively sell and pursue market share in all of our services 

branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative in 2003 we implemented a restricted stock program to better align our key employees with the interests of our shareholders and to motivate and retain them for the long term these restricted stock awards vest over a fiveyear period based on the company’s earnings growth and have been awarded annually since 2003 

  

our customers in 2009 we worked with more than 35000 customers up from approximately 32000 in 2008 we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse our top 100 customers represented approximately 35 percent of our total revenues and approximately 30 percent of our net revenues our largest customer was approximately seven percent of our total revenues and approximately three percent of our total net revenues 

our contracted carriers our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2009 our carrier base was approximately 47000 down from approximately 50000 in 2008 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 75 percent of our truckload shipments in 2009 in our transportation business no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately one percent of our contracted carrier capacity 

our goals since we became a publiclytraded company in 1997 our longterm compounded annual growth target has been 15 percent for net revenues income from operations and earnings per share this goal was based on an analysis of our performance in the previous 20 years during which our compounded annual growth rate was 15 percent and also on the size of our markets and available market share 

although there have been periods where we have not achieved these goals since 1997 we have exceeded this compounded growth goal in all three categories 

our expectation is that over time we will continue to achieve our longterm target of 15 percent growth but that we will have periods in which we exceed that goal and periods in which we fall short we expect to reach our longterm growth primarily through internal growth but acquisitions that fit our growth criteria and culture may also augment our growth 

a prolonged environment of weak demand is the most challenging for us during 2009 our consolidated total revenues decreased 117 percent due primarily to falling transportation rates and volume declines in many of our transportation modes transportation rates declined primarily due to a reduction in fuel prices and decreased pricing to our customers our pricing exclusive of fuel decreased due to a significant decline in overall transportation market demand as a result of the recession historically our net revenue margins have typically expanded and contracted based on fuel prices and the balance between demand and overall supply of capacity 

due to overall economic conditions and the significant decline in overall north american transportation volumes we did not achieve our longterm growth goal of 15 percent during 2009 our net revenues grew 05 percent to 14 billion our income from operations increased 23 percent to 5848 million and our diluted earnings per share increased 24 percent to 213 during 2009 our net revenue margins net revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to 182 percent in 2009 from 160 percent in 2008 net revenue margins increased largely due to a reduction in fuel prices and a lower cost of capacity while our volumes increased slightly in 2009 the trends of net revenue margin compression and accelerating volume growth in our north american truckload service during the fourth quarter of 2009 have continued into january 2010 our volumes continue to grow however our net revenue margin comparisons will continue to be challenging 

2009 compared to 2008 

total revenues and direct costs our consolidated total revenues decreased 117 percent in 2009 compared to 2008 total transportation revenues declined 162 percent to 598 billion in 2009 from 713 billion in 2008 total purchased transportation services declined 194 percent in 2009 to 477 billion from 592 billion in 2008 these declines were driven by falling transportation rates due primarily to a reduction in fuel prices and underlying rates during 2009 a significant decline in overall transportation market demand due to the economic recession impacted our volumes our sourcing revenue increased 112 percent to 156 billion in 2009 from 140 billion in 2008 purchased products sourced for resale increased 109 percent in 2009 to 143 billion from 129 billion in 2008 these increases were primarily due to volume growth including our previously announced acquisition of rosemont our information services revenue decreased 98 percent to 458 million in 2009 from 508 million in 2008 the decrease was driven by declines in transactions and declines in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices 

net revenues total transportation net revenues decreased 04 percent to 1208 billion in 2009 from 1212 billion in 2008 our transportation net revenue margin increased to 202 percent from 170 percent in 2008 largely driven by a decline in fuel prices and a lower cost of capacity while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contract carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough in our business therefore in times of lower fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage increases as it did in 2009 while we cannot predict what our net revenue margins will be in the future during the first half of 2009 our net revenue margins were at the high end of our historical range 

  

truck net revenues which consist of truckload and lessthantruckload ltl services comprise approximately 75 percent of our total net revenues our truck net revenues increased 10 percent to 104 billion in 2009 from 103 billion in 2008 truckload volumes decreased 08 percent in 2009 but yearoveryear growth improved as the year progressed our truckload rates decreased approximately 16 percent excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel on average our truckload rates decreased approximately 5 percent in 2009 truckload net revenue margin increased in 2009 due to a reduction in fuel prices and lower cost of capacity consistent with past periods of falling transportation demand our cost of capacity fell faster than our customer rates excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel our cost of truckload capacity decreased approximately 6 percent as carriers lowered their rates 

during 2009 our ltl net revenues decreased slightly the decrease was driven by price declines and lower revenue per transaction largely offset by an increase in shipment volumes prices declined significantly due to the lower cost of fuel and decreased underlying rates our revenue per transaction also declined due to lower weight per transaction our ltl volumes increased approximately 27 percent compared to 2008 our ltl net revenue margin in 2009 was relatively consistent with 2008 

our intermodal net revenue decrease of 192 percent to 352 million from 436 million in 2008 was driven largely by price declines and volume decreases net revenue margin was relatively consistent with 2008 

our ocean transportation net revenues decreased 127 percent to 542 million in 2009 due to price and volume declines excluding our previously disclosed acquisitions of transera and walker our ocean transportation net revenues would have declined approximately 21 percent net revenue margin increased significantly in 2009 compared to 2008 

our air transportation net revenues decrease of 77 percent in 2009 was driven by volume declines and price declines excluding our previously disclosed acquisitions our air transportation net revenues would have decreased approximately 15 percent 

other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of custom brokerage fees and transportation management fees the increase of 82 percent to 448 million in 2009 was driven primarily by increases in the transportation management business and by the acquisition of itc offset partially by a decrease in other customs brokerage activity excluding the acquisition of itc our other logistics services net revenues increased approximately four percent in 2009 

sourcing net revenues increased 152 percent to 1286 million in 2009 this increase was driven primarily by volume growth and the acquisition of rosemont our net revenue margin increased to 83 percent in 2009 from 80 percent in 2008 excluding the acquisition of rosemont sourcing net revenues increased approximately nine percent in 2009 

information services is comprised entirely of revenue generated by our subsidiary tchek for 2009 information systems net revenues declined 98 percent to 458 million the decrease was driven by declines in transactions and by declines in some fees that are impacted by fuel prices 

operating expenses operating expenses decreased 08 percent to 7971 million in 2009 from 8034 million in 2008 this was due to a decrease of 07 percent in personnel expenses and a decrease of 10 percent in other selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses decreased to 577 percent in 2009 compared to 584 percent in 2008 

our compensation plans are designed to keep personnel expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability in addition to our variable compensation plans our average headcount during 2009 declined approximately three percent over 2008 which contributed to the reduction in personnel expenses of 07 percent higher health insurance costs and severance pay lessened the expense reduction related to the headcount decline our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined slightly in 2009 to 432 percent from 438 percent in 2008 

in 2009 other selling general and administrative expenses decreased 10 percent to 1996 million in 2009 from 2016 million in 2008 we had increases in some expenses including provisions for doubtful accounts and occupancy our occupancy expense increase was due primarily to the completion of our data center in eden prairie minnesota and the locations we added through acquisition these increases were offset by reductions in travel entertainment and other discretionary expenses 

income from operations income from operations increased 23 percent to 5848 million in 2009 income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 423 percent in 2009 from 416 percent in 2008 

investment and other income investment and other income decreased 669 percent to 23 million in 2008 compared to 68 million in 2008 our investment income is down significantly compared to 2008 primarily due to the changes in the overall market yields on highquality shortterm investments 

  

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 385 percent for 2009 and 379 percent for 2008 the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal benefit 

net income net income increased 05 percent to 3608 million in 2009 from 3592 million in 2008 basic net income per share increased 14 percent to 215 diluted net income per share increased 24 percent to 213 

2008 compared to 2007 

total revenues and direct costs our consolidated total revenues for 2008 were 858 billion an increase of 173 percent over 732 billion in 2007 total transportation revenues increased 194 percent to 713 billion from 597 billion in 2007 total purchased transportation services increased 214 percent in 2008 to 592 billion from 487 billion in 2007 these increases were driven by the increased cost of fuel and volume increases in all of our modes of transportation our sourcing revenue increased 76 percent to 140 billion in 2008 from 130 billion in 2007 purchased products sourced for resale increased 73 percent in 2008 to 129 billion in 2008 from 120 billion in 2007 these increases were primarily due to volume growth our information services revenue increased 115 percent to 508 million in 2008 from 455 million in 2007 the increase was driven primarily by volume growth and higher fuel prices 

net revenues total transportation net revenues increased 104 percent to 121 billion in 2008 from 110 billion in 2007 our transportation net revenue margin or net revenue as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 170 percent in 2008 from 184 percent in 2007 primarily due to the increased cost of fuel and its impact on our truckload business while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough to our business therefore in times of higher fuel prices our net revenue margin percentage declines 

truck net revenues which consist of truckload and ltl services comprised approximately 75 percent of our total net revenues our truck net revenues increased 85 percent to 103 billion in 2008 truckload volumes increased approximately seven percent in 2008 but deteriorated as the year progressed including fuel our truckload rates increased approximately nine percent excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel underlying linehaul rates increased approximately one percent truckload net revenue margins decreased in 2008 due to the higher cost of fuel for most of 2008 compared to 2007 

during 2008 our ltl volumes increased approximately 19 percent despite weakening demand for trucking services in the marketplace we were able to capture additional market share and grow our volumes with existing customers and gain new customers ltl net revenue margins for 2008 were consistent with 2007 

intermodal net revenues increased 128 percent to 436 million from 387 million in 2007 due to an increase in volumes offset partially by a decrease in our net revenue margins crossselling with existing customers and new customer growth drove our volume growth 

our ocean transportation net revenues increased 426 percent to 621 million in 2008 our growth was driven by an increase in volumes and an increase in our net revenue margins our previously disclosed acquisition of transera on august 1 2008 contributed approximately 153 percent to the overall increase our volumes grew due to adding new customers and growth with existing customers net revenue margins expanded due to more widely available capacity in the marketplace 

our air transportation net revenues increased 130 percent to 354 million in 2008 the increase was driven by significant volume increases partially offset by a decline in our net revenue margins our acquisition of transera contributed approximately five percent to the overall increase 

other logistics services net revenues consist primarily of customs brokerage fees and transportation management fees the increase of 175 percent to 414 million in 2008 was driven primarily by increases in transportation management business 

sourcing net revenues increased 114 percent to 1116 million in 2008 our sourcing business is the buying and selling of fresh fruits and vegetables for several years we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base focusing on large retailers restaurant chains and foodservice providers as a result we continue to see the longterm trend of growth in our integrated relationships and valueadded products and an expansion of our services which have resulted in increased volumes and net revenue margins in 2008 

for 2008 information systems net revenues growth of 115 percent to 508 million was driven primarily by volume growth in local fleet card services some of our carrier compliance services cash advance services maintenance fees and merchant services higher fuel prices contributed to some of our growth because with certain merchants our fee is based on a percentage of the sale amount volumes in our overtheroad fuel card declined slightly due to the reduction in freight demand in marketplace resulting in a smaller number of transactions  

operating expenses operating expenses increased 94 percent to 8034 million in 2008 from 7341 million in 2007 this was due to an increase of 60 percent in personnel expenses and an increase in selling general and administrative expenses 

  

of 213 percent as a percentage of net revenues operating expenses decreased to 584 percent in 2008 from 590 percent in 2008 

personnel expenses increased 60 percent to 6018 million in 2008 from 5680 million in 2007 the increase is largely due to growth in our headcount which increased by over 600 people or 86 percent in 2008 expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are variable based on growth in our earnings our slower earnings growth in 2008 compared to 2007 resulted in a decrease in expense related to some of these incentive plans this contributed to our personnel expenses growing slower than our net revenues personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue declined to 438 percent in 2008 from 457 percent in 2007 

other selling general and administrative expenses for 2008 were 2016 million an increase of 213 percent from 1661 million in 2007 the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses was driven by several expense categories including provision for doubtful accounts occupancy and claims as a percentage of net revenues other selling general and administrative expenses increased to 146 percent in 2008 compared to 134 percent in 2007 

our total provision for doubtful accounts was 143 million for the year compared to 67 million in 2007 due to economic conditions we had a higher level of customerspecific payment issues and bankruptcies than we typically experience it is very difficult for us to predict whether other accounts will have issues in the future but believe our reserve for doubtful accounts is appropriate 

our occupancy expense increased faster than our net revenues primarily due to primarily to an increase in office space occupancy expense is driven primarily by contractual lease agreements of our branch locations which are fixed in the shortterm and therefore difficult to reduce as our net revenue growth slows 

income from operations income from operations increased 121 percent to 5716 million for 2008 this increase was primarily driven by the growth in our net revenues income from operations as a percentage of net revenues was 416 percent and 409 percent for 2008 and 2007 

investment and other income investment and other income decreased 508 percent to 68 million in 2008 our investment yield declined significantly from 2007 to 2008 due to changes in the short term highquality interest rate market during 2008 nearly all of our investments were in money market funds that generally have a lower yield during 2007 we were invested in auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes which had a higher investment yield 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 379 percent for 2008 and 381 percent for 2007 the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal benefit 

net income net income increased 108 percent to 3592 million for 2008 basic net income per share increased 116 percent to 212 diluted income per share increased 118 percent to 208 for 2008 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock cash and cash equivalents totaled 3373 million and 4947 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 short and longterm availableforsale securities consisting primarily of highly liquid investments totaled 513 million and 26 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 working capital at december 31 2009 and 2008 was 5755 million and 6502 million 

we prioritize our investments to grow the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions to redeploy our cash but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities we continue to invest our cash with a focus on principal preservation our current interestbearing cash and investments are split primarily between municipal money markets and municipal bonds our investment income is down significantly compared to last year due to the changes in the overall market yields of highquality shortterm investments 

cash flow from operating activities we generated 3726 million 4476 million and 3084 million of cash flow from operations in 2009 2008 and 2007 during 2009 our cash flow from operations decreased 168 percent compared to a 05 percent increase in net income the primary factor that caused this decrease in 2009 was the increase in our accounts receivables balance of 68 percent to 8855 million in 2009 from 8289 million in 2008 as a result of increased volumes in late 2009 compared with 2008 

cash used for investing activities we used 1239 million of cash in 2009 generated 315 million cash in 2008 and used cash of 557 million in 2007 for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of cash paid for acquisitions capital expenditures and investing in securities 

  

we used cash of 411 million 597 million and 222 million for acquisitions in 2009 2008 and 2007 on june 12 2009 we acquired walker on july 7 2009 we acquired itc and on september 15 2009 we acquired rosemont the amount paid in 2008 included 502 million related to the closing of one acquisition and 95 million related to earnout payments and holdbacks from prior year acquisitions the amount paid in 2007 included 98 million related to the closing of one acquisition and 124 million related to earnout payments and holdbacks from prior year acquisitions 

we also used 345 million 237 million and 437 million of net capital expenditures in 2009 2008 and 2007 we spent 139 million 56 million and 211 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 on facilities on our new corporate campus in eden prairie mn the remaining capital expenditures of 206 million 181 million and 226 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 relate primarily to annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems 

in 2009 we used 485 million in net purchases and salesmaturities of availableforsale securities during 2008 we exited nearly all of our availableforsale securities and invested in cash and cash equivalents which generated 1141 million of cash from investing activities 

cash used for financing activities we used 4021 million 3260 million and 2621 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2009 2008 and 2007 this was primarily quarterly dividends and share repurchases 

we used 1629 million 1512 million and 1252 million to pay cash dividends in 2009 2008 and 2007 with the increase in 2009 due to a 9 percent increase in our quarterly dividend rate from 022 per share in 2008 to 024 per share in 2009 

we also used 2669 million 2008 million and 1673 million on share repurchases in 2009 2008 and 2007 the increase in 2009 was due to a 37 percent increase in the number of shares repurchased we are currently purchasing shares under the 2007 authorization of 10000000 shares as of december 31 2009 there were approximately 1115000 shares remaining under the 2007 authorization during the third quarter of 2009 the ch robinson board of directors authorized management to repurchase an additional 10000000 shares these repurchases are expected to take place over multiple years the number of shares we repurchase if any during future periods will vary based on our cash position potential uses of our cash and market conditions 

we had 35 million euros available under a line of credit at an interest rate of euribor plus 45 basis points this discretionary line of credit was closed on november 1 2009 

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we have all credit risk we maintain substantially all risks and rewards we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management and all transactions in information services are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have 

  

identified the allowance of 307 million as of december 31 2009 increased compared to the allowance of 293 million as of december 31 2008 we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis in the case where we have an acquisition that we feel has not yet become integrated into our branch network component we will evaluate the impairment of any goodwill related to that specific acquisition and its results the fair value of the enterprisewide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value therefore we have determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of december 31 2009 

stockbased compensation the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts have varied from 12 to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model increased stock price volatility is the primary reason for the changes in the discount for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards the determination of the fair value of sharebased awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies 

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2009 

payments due by period dollars in thousands 

 

  

  we have no longterm debt or capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2009 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 105 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes our obligations for payment of contingent purchase price related to acquisitions have been excluded from the table above as the timing and exact amount of cash payment is uncertain the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain we also enter into air and ocean freight and produce purchase contracts which are all shortterm in nature these liabilities have been excluded from the table as the amount of any cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2009 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we had 3886 million of cash and investments on december 31 2009 consisting of 3373 million of cash and cash equivalents and 513 million of short and longterm availableforsale securities although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers all of our availableforsale securities are highquality bonds and substantially all are exempt from us federal income taxes because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks a hypothetical 100basispoint change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our earnings we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material due to the size of our international operations

 item 1 business tableend overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2008 gross revenues of 86 billion we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2008 including our transportation management services business we handled approximately 73 million shipments for more than 32000 customers we operate through a network of 228 offices which we call branches in north america europe asia south america and the middle east we have developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide logistics services worldwide as a result we have the capability of managing most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

we are a nonasset based transportation provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers’ freight through our contractual relationships with approximately 50000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers we select and hire the appropriate transportation to manage our customers’ freight needs being nonasset based means we can be flexible and focus on seeking solutions that work for our customers rather than focusing on asset utilization as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as supply chain analysis freight consolidation core carrier program management and information reporting 

in addition to multimodal transportation services we have two other logistics business lines fresh produce sourcing and feebased information services 

sourcing the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce was our original business when we were founded in 1905 much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities we purchase fresh produce through our network of independent produce suppliers our customers include regional and national grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors in many cases we also arrange the transport of the fresh produce we sell through our relationships with owners of specialized transportation equipment we have developed our own brands of produce including the fresh 1 ® and ourworld ® organics and also have entered into licensing agreements to distribute produce under other national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures as part of our sourcing business 

information services our third business line is comprised of a ch robinson subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are primarily motor carriers for which it provides a variety of management and information services such as fuel management services funds transfer permit procurement fuel and use tax reporting and driver funds transfer for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller transfers funds to the truck stop and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

our business model has been the main driver of our strong historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our branch network of 228 offices staffed by approximately 6100 salespeople these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations approximately 35 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches our north american branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative 

  

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by expanding current offices opening new branch offices and hiring additional salespeople we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in august 2008 we acquired certain operating subsidiaries of transera international holdings ltd “transera” a project forwarding company based in calgary canada project forwarding involves international transport and forwarding of oversized and over dimensional freight on a project basis transera has annual gross revenues of approximately 125 million 

multimodal transportation and logistics services 

ch robinson is a third party logistics company we provide freight transportation and logistics services we are a nonasset based provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight we make a profit or margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation provider to handle or transport the freight 

we provide all of the following transportation and logistics services 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the branch salesperson responsible for their account customers communicate with us by means of telephone fax internet email or edi electronic data interchange the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is entered into our proprietary operating system with the help of information provided by the operating system the salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the shipment and selects a carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different branch offices collaborate to hire the appropriate carrier for our customer’s freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the carrier to agree on the price for the transportation and the carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the carrier through numerous means of communication including edi our proprietary web site chrwtruckscom ®  email fax and telephone to provide tracking and status updates of the shipment through delivery 

for most of our transportation and logistics services we are a principal in the transaction by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the carrier for the claims 

in our transportation management business we are acting as a shipper’s agent and we collect a fee for our services we are not a principal in the transaction 

  

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer in some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitment to handle the shipments is usually at specific rates subject to seasonal variation most of our rate commitments are for one year or less as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate 

the majority of our truckload freight is priced to our contract carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis when we enter into spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutuallyagreed upon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however we will estimate and report fuel separately if requested by the carrier in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract in those cases where we have prearranged rates with carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customer’s warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting feebased transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become key providers to our customers responsible for a greater portion of their supply chain management we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included as part of our audited consolidated financial statements for an allocation of our gross revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2008 and 2007 in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation gross profits 

in thousands 

 

  

    

transportation services accounted for approximately 88 percent of our gross profits in 2008 and 2007 and 87 percent in 2006 

sourcing 

throughout our 103year history we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

for several years we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base by focusing on large multistore grocery retailers restaurant chains and foodservice providers historically grocery retailers have relied primarily on regional or even local purchases from food wholesalers for produce sourcing and storelevel distribution as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation these methods have become inefficient our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers’ produce purchasing and provide consistent quality across regions and stores 

our sourcing services have expanded to include justintime replenishment commodity management and business analysis we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands the fresh 1® fresh’n easy® our world® organics tropic sweet® tomorrow’s® organics and kensington farms® and licensed brands mott’s® tropicana® welch’s® and bambino® these programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred supplier programs 

sourcing accounted for approximately eight percent of our gross profits in 2008 and 2007 and nine percent in 2006 

information services 

information services is comprised of a subsidiary of ch robinson tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are primarily motor carriers and truck stop chains tchek provides its motor carrier customers with fuel management services funds transfer fuel and use tax reporting driver payroll services permits and online access to customtailored information management reports all through the use of its proprietary automated systems these systems enable motor carriers to track equipment manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

information services accounted for approximately four percent of our gross profits in 2008 2007 and 2006 

organization 

to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices which we call “branches” we currently have 228 branches up from 218 in 2007 our branches are supported by executives and other centralized shared services approximately ten percent of our employees are corporate employees who provide these centralized shared services over onethird of these corporate employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network 

branch network 

we currently have branches in the following areas of the world 

 

   

each branch is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire carriers to provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and third party sources such as industry directories salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and that they do not have an unacceptable safety rating 

branch expansion we expect to continue to open new branch offices new branch offices are viewed as a longterm contributor to overall company growth in addition to market opportunity a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch additional branches are often opened within a geographic area previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch a modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space communications and hardware and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time we have also augmented our branch office network through selective acquisitions 

branch employees because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our hiring we recruit applicants from across north america europe asia and south america our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

early in their tenure most newly hired branch employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the necessary skills and customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training at the branch level we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks 

employees at a branch operate and are compensated in large part on a team basis the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch or business unit branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year the percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the branch employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our 401k plan in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time  

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan within that plan in 2003 we began regularly issuing restricted stock and restricted stock units as our primary equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders for most restricted equity awards restricted stock and units are available to vest over five calendar years based on company performance 

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management national sales and national account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

executive officers 

under our decentralized business structure branch managers while retaining autonomy for their branch performance receive guidance and support from the executives at our central corporate office these executives provide training and education develop new services and applications to be offered to customers analyze and monitor branch productivity and performance metrics share operations and management guidance and provide broad market analysis

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we had a total of 7961 employees of whom approximately 7100 were located in our branch offices services such as accounting information technology legal marketing human resource support credit and claims management and carrier services are supported centrally 

customers and marketing 

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2008 we served over 32000 customers 

  

worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2008 no customer accounted for more than six percent of gross revenues or three percent of gross profits in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we believe that our decentralized structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers with the guidance of experienced branch managers who have an average tenure of 11 years with us branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that we can provide we have also expanded our national sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities branches also call on our executives our corporate sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to assure dependable services favorable pricing and carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we do not own any transportation equipment or employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success 

as of december 31 2008 we had worked with approximately 50000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for carriers to work with us we have a policy of prompt payment upon receipt of proof of delivery for those carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances through our tchek subsidiary 

these motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds these carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one carrier our largest truckload carrier was less than one percent of our total cost of transportation in 2008 motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 75 percent of our truckload shipments in 2008 we qualify each carrier to make sure it is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federally issued authority to provide transportation services and that it has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners stacktrain operators and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis 

in our nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc ocean transportation and freight forwarding business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay our ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers specific trade lane requirements and anticipated growth in the international shipping marketplace these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

in our air freight forwarding business we purchase transportation services from approximately 200 air carriers through charter services block space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements are annual contracts that include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed annually or throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

  

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of other nonasset based logistics companies assetbased trucking companies third party freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces we also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

the primary business of our information services business which is comprised of our subsidiary tchek systems is fuel card services the fuel card processing industry is very consolidated and a small number of companies represent the majority of the market 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 communications and information systems 

our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate service our customers and carriers and manage our business our proprietary information systems help our employees efficiently manage more than 73 million shipments annually 32000 customer relationships and 50000 carrier relationships our employees are linked with each other and with our customers carriers and suppliers by telephone fax internet email andor edi to communicate shipment requirements and availability and to confirm and bill orders 

our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities communicate and coordinate activity with other branches and “crosscover” or find equipment for other branches’ freight our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate shipments and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems also make shipment data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers enabling our salespeople to select carriers and track shipments in progress our systems automatically provide alerts to arising problems our systems also provide performance and productivity reports that our managers and executives can use to more efficiently manage our business 

through our internet sites chrwonlinecom® and chrwtruckscom® customers and carriers can contract for shipments or equipment as well as track and trace shipments including delivery confirmation customers carriers and suppliers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the internet our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers and carriers these reports provide them with information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and support analysis of their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute costs 

  

government regulation 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements under certain limited circumstances one of our subsidiary companies provides limited motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the dot including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc for which we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as an indirect air carrier of cargo subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we source fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations are subject to federal and state regulations including but not limited to the bank security act of 1970 

risk management and insurance 

we contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in auto insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance we also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for damage to our customer’s cargo in our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including auto and general liability with a 200 million umbrella in 2008 and 2009 our contingent auto liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident for the years 2004 through 2006 3 million per incident for 2007 and 2008 and 5 million per incident in 2009 

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover this type of risk in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which are generally not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary and licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should consider carefully the following cautionary statements if you own our common stock or are planning to buy our common stock we intend to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” by providing this discussion we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results except to the extent required by law 

the current economic recession could have a significant adverse impact on our business the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control deterioration in the current economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals 

 

  

  

   

  

 higher carrier prices may result in decreased gross profit margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses and our gross profits and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of higher transportation costs 

changing fuel costs may have an impact on our gross profit margins in our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our gross profits rising fuel prices may result in a decreased gross profit margin when we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate when we are purchasing transportation services the majority of our truckload freight is priced to our contract carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis for spot transactions with contract motor carriers we generally negotiate a mutuallyagreed upon total market rate that includes all costs including any applicable fuel expense however we will estimate and report fuel separately if requested by the carrier while our different pricing arrangements with customers and carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough to our business therefore in times of higher fuel prices our gross profit margin percentage declines 

we depend upon others to provide equipment and services we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers freight and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims this reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

 our international business raises additional difficulties we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

  

our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals in order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands in periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad based we compete against other nonasset based logistics companies as well as logistics companies that own their own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services and internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our gross profit and income from operations 

we are reliant on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers we are reliant on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner computer viruses could cause an interruption to the availability of our systems unauthorized access to our systems with malicious intent could result in the theft of proprietary information and in systems outages an unplanned systems outage or unauthorized access to our systems could materially and adversely affect our business 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america europe asia south america and the middle east supported by executives and services in a central corporate office with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions and the growth of the business in their branch our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition certain of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies and their drivers in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owner operators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our auto liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident for years 2004 through 2006 3 million per incident for 2007 and 2008 and 5 million per incident in 2009 a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently 

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we 

  

may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 201 million in 2008 and 2009 for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages which our insurance does not cover any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond and by the transportation security administration as an independent air carrier we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal and state environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

we derive a significant portion of our gross revenues and gross profit from our largest clients our top 100 customers comprise approximately onethird of consolidated gross profits with none of them individually exceeding three percent the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all if we acquire a company we may have difficulty integrating its businesses products services technologies and personnel into our operations acquired companies or operations may have unexpected liabilities and we may face challenges in retaining significant customers of acquired companies these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price historically our longterm growth objective has been 15 percent for gross profits operating income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend as we previously disclosed certain gender discrimination class claims were settled in 2006 the settlement was within our insurance coverage limits and was fully funded by insurance 

  

although insurance fully funded the gender class settlement those insurers reserved the right to seek a court ruling that a portion of the settlement was not covered under their policies and also to dispute payment of certain defense costs incurred in that litigation insurance coverage litigation between us and one of our insurance carriers concerning these issues and insurance coverage for individual lawsuits that were not part of the class settlement has been pending in minnesota state court recent court rulings have determined that the gender class settlement payment was appropriately covered under applicable policies and that the insurance carrier has a duty to reimburse reasonable defense costs in the gender class action and all but two of the individual lawsuits and to indemnify us in all but two of the individual lawsuits this ruling is being appealed by the insurance carrier 

the settlement of the gender discrimination class claims did not include claims of putative class members who subsequently filed individual equal employment opportunity commission eeoc charges after the denial of class status 54 of those eeoc claimants filed lawsuits 52 of those suits have been settled or dismissed the settlement amounts were not material to our financial position or results of operations we are vigorously defending the remaining two lawsuits 

we are not subject to any other pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend results of operations 

the following table illustrates our gross profit margins by services and products 

 

 the following table summarizes our gross profits by service line 

 

 the following table represents certain statements of operations data shown as percentages of our gross profits 

 

 overview 

our company we are a global provider of multimodal transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of branch offices in north america europe asia south america and the middle east we are a nonasset based transportation provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers’ freight we work with approximately 50000 transportation companies worldwide and through those relationships we select and hire the appropriate transportation providers to meet our customers’ needs as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of value added logistics services such as supply chain analysis freight consolidation core carrier program management and information reporting 

  

in addition to multimodal transportation services we have two other logistics business lines fresh produce sourcing and feebased information services our sourcing business is the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers and restaurant chains produce wholesalers foodservice and distributors in the majority of cases we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies our information services business is our subsidiary tchek systems inc which provides a variety of management and information services to motor carrier companies and to fuel distributors those services include funds transfer driver payroll services fuel management services permit procurement and fuel and use tax reporting 

our business model we are a service company we act principally to add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics including sourcing of produce products for our customers our gross revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers our gross profits are our gross revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling including motor carrier rail ocean air and other costs and the purchase price of the products we source our gross profits are the primary indicator of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement accordingly the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our gross profits 

we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions we buy most of our transportation capacity and produce on a spotmarket basis we also keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible compensation our largest operating expense is performanceoriented and for most employees in the branch network based on the profitability of their individual branch office 

in addition we do not have precommitted targets for headcount growth our personnel decisions are decentralized our branch managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices within productivity guidelines based on their branch’s volume of business this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business 

our branch network our branch network is a major competitive advantage building local customer and carrier relationships has been an important part of our success and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally nationally and globally our branch offices help us penetrate local markets provide facetoface service when needed and recruit contract carriers our branch network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions which is important in the transportation industry because it is so dynamic and marketdriven 

our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers approximately 35 percent of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches for many of our significant customer relationships we coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs in addition our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches our north american branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction 

during 2008 we increased the size of our branch network by 10 branches to 228 we opened eight new branches and added two branches through acquisition we are planning limited branch openings during 2009 because we usually open new offices with only two or three employees we do not expect them to make a material contribution to our financial results in the first few years of their operation 

our people because we are a service company our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented productive people our headcount grew by 629 employees during 2008 including 117 employees added by acquisition branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on individual performance and the profitability of their branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative in 2003 we implemented a restricted stock program to better align our key employees with the interests of our shareholders and to motivate and retain them for the long term these restricted stock awards vest over a fiveyear period based on the performance of the company and have been awarded annually since 2003 

our customers in 2008 we worked with approximately 32000 customers up from approximately 29000 in 2007 we work with a wide variety of companies ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses in many different industries our customer base is very diverse our top 100 customers represented approximately 30 percent of our total gross profits and our largest customer was approximately three percent of our total gross profits 

our carriers our carrier base includes motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers in 2008 we increased our carrier base to approximately 50000 up from approximately 48000 in 2007 while our volume with many of these new providers may still be small we believe the growth in our contract carrier network shows that we are well positioned to continue to meet our customers’ needs motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 75 percent of our truckload shipments in 2008 in our truckload business no single carrier represents more than one percent of our carrier capacity 

  

our goals since we became a publiclytraded company in 1997 our longterm compounded annual growth target has been 15 percent for gross profits income from operations and earnings per share this goal was based on an analysis of our performance in the previous twenty years during which our compounded annual growth rate was 15 percent although there have been periods where we have not achieved these goals since 1997 we have exceeded this compounded growth goal in all three categories 

our expectation is that over time we will continue to achieve our longterm target of 15 percent growth but that we will have periods in which we exceed that goal and periods in which we fall short we expect to reach our longterm growth primarily through internal growth but acquisitions that fit our growth criteria and culture may also augment our growth 

in 2008 our gross profits grew 105 percent to 14 billion our income from operations increased 121 percent to 5716 million and our diluted earnings per share increased 118 percent to 208 due to overall economic conditions and the rapid decline in north american truckload volumes which are the largest source of our gross profits we did not achieve our longterm growth goal of 15 percent in 2008 truckload volumes in the marketplace and in our business slowed as the year progressed and on a per business day basis our north american truckload gross profits declined in december the environment remains unpredictable based on published industry freight indexes and reductions in overall economic activity and manufacturing production 2009 may be very challenging for growth and it is more likely that we will not achieve our longterm growth goals 

2008 compared to 2007 

revenues gross revenues for 2008 were 858 billion an increase of 173 percent over 732 billion in 2007 gross profits in 2008 were 137 billion an increase of 105 percent over 124 billion in 2007 this was the result of an increase in our transportation gross profits of 104 percent to 121 billion an increase in our sourcing gross profits of 114 percent to 1116 million and an increase in our information services gross profits of 115 percent to 508 million 

during 2008 our gross profit margin or gross profits as a percentage of gross revenues decreased to 160 percent from 170 percent in 2007 transportation gross profit margin decreased to 170 percent in 2008 from 184 percent in 2007 primarily due to the increased cost of fuel and its impact on our truckload business while our different pricing arrangements with customers and carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough to our business therefore in times of higher fuel prices our gross profit margin percentage declines sourcing gross profit margin increased to 80 percent in 2008 from 77 percent in 2007 information services is a feebased business which generates 100 percent gross profit margin 

transportation gross profits increased 104 percent to 121 billion in 2008 from 110 billion in 2007 transportation revenues are generated through several transportation services including truck intermodal ocean air and miscellaneous services 

truck gross profits which consists of truckload and lessthantruckload ltl increased 85 percent to 103 billion in 2008 truckload volumes increased approximately seven percent in 2008 but deteriorated as the year progressed truckload gross profit margins decreased in 2008 due to the higher cost of fuel for most of 2008 compared to 2007 including fuel our truckload rates increased approximately nine percent excluding estimated impacts of fuel underlying linehaul rates increased approximately one percent our ltl volumes increased approximately 19 percent in 2008 ltl gross profit margins for 2008 were consistent with 2007 despite weakening demand for trucking services in the marketplace we were able to capture additional market share and grow our volumes with existing customers and gain new customers 

intermodal gross profits increased 128 percent to 436 million from 387 million in 2007 due to an increase in volumes offset partially by a decrease in our gross profit margins crossselling with existing customers and new customer growth drove our volume growth 

our ocean transportation gross profits increased 426 percent to 621 million in 2008 our growth was driven by an increase in volumes and an increase in our gross profit margins our previously disclosed acquisition of transera on august 1 2008 contributed approximately 153 percent to the overall increase our volumes grew due to adding new customers and growth with existing customers gross profit margins expanded due to more widely available capacity in the marketplace 

our air transportation gross profits increased 130 percent to 354 million in 2008 the increase was driven by significant volume increases partially offset by a decline in our gross profit margins our acquisition of transera contributed approximately five percent to the overall increase 

  

miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist primarily of customs brokerage fees and transportation management fees the increase of 175 percent to 414 million in 2008 was driven primarily by increases in transportation management business 

sourcing gross profits increased 114 percent to 1116 million in 2008 our sourcing business is the buying and selling of fresh fruits and vegetables for several years we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base focusing on large retailers restaurant chains and foodservice providers as a result we continue to see the longterm trend of growth in our integrated relationships and valueadded products and an expansion of our services which have resulted in increased volumes and gross profit margins in 2008 

information services is comprised entirely of revenue generated by our subsidiary tchek systems for 2008 information systems gross profits growth of 115 percent to 508 million was driven primarily by volume growth in local fleet card services some of our carrier compliance services cash advance services maintenance fees and merchant services higher fuel prices contributed to some of our growth because with certain merchants our fee is based on a percentage of the sale amount volumes in our overtheroad fuel card declined slightly due to the reduction in freight demand in marketplace resulting in a smaller number of transactions  

selling general and administrative expenses personnel expenses increased 60 percent to 6018 million in 2008 and decreased as a percentage of gross profits to 438 percent in 2008 from 457 percent in 2007 personnel expenses account for nearly 75 percent of our total selling general and administrative expenses the increase is largely due to growth in our headcount which increased by over 600 people or 86 percent in 2008 expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are variable based on growth in our earnings our slower earnings growth in 2008 compared to 2007 resulted in a decrease in expense related to some of these incentive plans this contributed to our personnel expenses growing slower than our gross profits 

other selling general and administrative expenses for 2008 were 2016 million an increase of 213 percent from 1661 million in 2007 the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses was driven by several expense categories including provision for doubtful accounts occupancy and claims as a percentage of gross profits other selling general and administrative expenses increased to 146 percent in 2008 compared to 134 percent in 2007 

our total provision for doubtful accounts was 143 million for the year compared to 67 million in 2007 due to economic conditions we had a higher level of customerspecific payment issues and bankruptcies than we typically experience it is very difficult for us to predict whether other accounts will have issues in the future but believe our reserve for doubtful accounts is appropriate 

our occupancy expense increased faster than our gross profits primarily due to primarily to an increase in office space occupancy expense is driven primarily by contractual lease agreements of our branch locations which are fixed in the shortterm and therefore difficult to reduce as our gross profit growth slows 

income from operations income from operations increased 121 percent to 5716 million for 2008 this increase was primarily driven by the growth in our gross profits income from operations as a percentage of gross profits was 416 percent and 409 percent for 2008 and 2007 

investment and other income investment and other income decreased 508 percent to 68 million in 2008 our investment yield declined significantly from 2007 to 2008 due to changes in the short term highquality interest rate market during 2008 nearly all of our investments were in money market funds that generally have a lower yield during 2007 we were invested in auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes which had a higher investment yield 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 379 percent for 2008 and 381 percent for 2007 the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal benefit 

net income net income increased 108 percent to 3592 million for 2008 basic net income per share increased 116 percent to 212 diluted income per share increased 118 percent to 208 for 2008 

2007 compared to 2006 

revenues gross revenues for 2007 were 732 billion an increase of 116 percent over 656 billion in 2006 gross profits in 2007 were 124 billion an increase of 149 percent over 108 billion in 2006 this was the result of an increase in our transportation gross profits of 161 percent to 110 billion an increase in our sourcing gross profits of 64 percent to 1002 million and an increase in our information services gross profits of 75 percent to 455 million 

  

during 2007 our gross profit margin or gross profits as a percentage of gross revenues increased to 170 percent from 165 percent in 2006 transportation gross profit margin increased to 184 percent in 2007 from 178 percent in 2006 sourcing gross profit margin decreased to 77 percent in 2007 from 79 percent in 2006 information services is a feebased business which generates 100 percent gross profit margin 

transportation gross profits increased 161 percent to 110 billion in 2007 from 9460 million in 2006 transportation revenues are generated through several transportation services including truck intermodal ocean air and miscellaneous services 

truck gross profits including ltl increased 153 percent to 9493 million in 2007 this increase was generated by volume growth of over ten percent and increased gross profit margins partially offset by a rate decline of approximately two percent this rate decline excludes the impact of higher fuel prices despite weakening demand for trucking services in the marketplace we were able to capture additional market share and grow our volumes with existing customers and gain new customers our margins expanded due to more widely available capacity in the marketplace compared to 2006 

intermodal gross profits increased 69 percent to 387 million from 362 million in 2006 due to an increase in volumes our volume growth was driven by crossselling with existing customers and new customer growth 

our ocean transportation gross profits increased 172 percent to 435 million in 2007 our growth was driven by an increase in volumes and an increase in our gross profit margins our volumes grew due to adding new customers and growth with existing customers gross profit margins expanded due to more widely available capacity in the marketplace 

our air transportation gross profits increased 454 percent to 313 million in 2007 the increase was driven by significant volume increases partially offset by a decline in our gross profit margins due to changes in our geographic and cargo consolidation mix our air gross profits also included approximately 21 million of domestic air gross profits from our previouslydisclosed acquisition of lxsi services inc on july 13 2007 

miscellaneous transportation gross profits consist primarily of customs brokerage fees and transportation management fees the increase of 252 percent to 352 million in 2007 was driven by increases in transportation management business 

sourcing gross profits increased 64 percent to 1002 million in 2007 driven by growth in our volumes partially offset by a decrease in our sourcing gross profit margins our sourcing business is the buying and selling of fresh fruits and vegetables for several years we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base focusing on large retailers restaurant chains and foodservice providers as a result we continue to see the longterm trend of increases in volume and gross profits in our integrated relationships with these customers offset by a decline in our business with produce wholesale customers our gross profit margin declined in 2007 primarily because of higher prices for certain commodities related to weather and higher labor and fuel costs 

information services is comprised entirely of revenue generated by our subsidiary tchek systems for 2007 information systems gross profits growth of 75 percent to 455 million was driven primarily by volume growth in our core fuel card and cash advance services in addition our gross profit per transaction was up slightly due to the price of fuel with certain merchants our fee is based on a percentage of the sale amount approximately 30 percent of the growth was related to other services such as fleet card and carrier compliance services 

selling general and administrative expenses many of our selling general and administrative expenses are variable in relation to gross profits however we did gain leverage in certain expenses 

personnel expenses increased by 101 percent to 5680 million in 2007 and decreased as a percentage of gross profits to 457 percent in 2007 from 477 percent in 2006 personnel expenses account for nearly 80 percent of our total selling general and administrative expenses expenses related to our restricted stock program and various other incentive plans are variable based on growth in our earnings our slower earnings growth in 2007 compared to 2006 resulted in a decrease in expense related to some of these incentive plans this contributed to our personnel expenses growing slower than our gross profits 

we focus on keeping personnel expenses as variable as possible while looking for opportunities to be more efficient gross profits per employee increased 31 percent in 2007 over 2006 this increase was driven primarily by increased productivity and our slower headcount growth relative to our gross profit growth 

other selling general and administrative expenses for 2007 were 1661 million an increase of 117 percent from 1488 million in 2006 as a percentage of gross profits other selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 134 percent in 2007 compared to 137 percent in 2006 we strive to keep our expenses as variable as possible with our revenue growth in 2007 we did gain leverage in our other selling general and administrative expenses 

  

income from operations income from operations increased 220 percent to 5097 million for 2007 this increase was primarily driven by the growth in our gross profits income from operations as a percentage of gross profits was 409 percent and 386 percent for 2007 and 2006 

investment and other income investment and other income increased 168 percent to 138 million in 2007 our portfolio yield increased slightly in 2007 from 2006 

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 381 percent for 2007 and 379 percent for 2006 the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal benefit 

net income net income increased 215 percent to 3243 million for 2007 basic net income per share increased 218 percent to 190 diluted income per share increased 216 percent to 186 for 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically generated substantial cash from operations which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock cash and cash equivalents totaled 4947 million and 3389 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 availableforsale securities consisting primarily of highly liquid investments totaled 26 million and 1158 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 working capital at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 6502 million and 6315 million 

our first priority for our cash is growing the business as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow we are continually looking for acquisitions to redeploy our cash but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities 

if our cash balance continues to increase and there are no significant attractive acquisition opportunities we expect to return more of the cash to our shareholders through future dividends and share repurchases 

cash from operating activities we generated 4476 million 3084 million and 3434 million of cash flow from operations in 2008 2007 and 2006 during 2008 our cash flow from operations increased 451 percent compared to a 108 percent increase in net income the primary factor that caused this increase in 2008 was the decrease in our accounts receivables balance of 91 percent to 8289 million in 2008 from 9118 million in 2007 as a result of declines in fuel prices and volumes at the end of 2008 compared to 2007 

cash used for investing activities we generated 315 million cash in 2008 used cash of 557 million in 2007 and used 812 million cash in 2006 for investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of cash paid for acquisitions and our capital expenditures during 2008 we exited nearly all of our availableforsale securities and invested in cash and cash equivalents which generated 1141 million of cash from investing activities 

we used cash of 597 million 222 million and 397 million for acquisitions in 2008 2007 and 2006 the amount paid in 2008 included 502 million related to the closing of one acquisition and 95 million related to earnout payments and holdbacks from prior year acquisitions the amount paid in 2007 included 98 million related to the closing of one acquisition and 124 million related to earnout payments and holdbacks from prior year acquisitions the amount paid in 2006 included 295 million related to the closing of two acquisitions and 102 million related to earnout payments and holdbacks from prior year acquisitions 

we also used 237 million 437 million and 433 million of net capital expenditures in 2008 2007 and 2006 we spent 56 million 211 million and 204 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 on facilities on our new corporate campus in eden prairie mn this includes the spending to date on our new data center the remaining capital expenditures of 181 million 226 million and 229 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 relate primarily to annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems 

cash used for financing activities we used 3260 million 2621 million and 1458 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2008 2007 and 2006 this was primarily quarterly dividends and share repurchases 

we used 1512 million 1252 million and 908 million to pay cash dividends in 2008 2007 and 2006 with the increase in 2008 due to a 22 percent increase in our quarterly dividend rate from 018 per share in 2007 to 022 per share in 2008 

we also used 2008 million 1673 million and 853 million on share repurchases in 2008 2007 and 2006 the increase in 2008 was due to a 13 percent increase in the number of shares repurchased and an increase in the average price paid per share we will continue to use share repurchases as a variable way to return excess capital to shareholders our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase plan in 2007 of up to 10 million shares we have used approximately 38 million shares of that authorization 

  

we have 35 million euros available under a line of credit at an interest rate of 665 percent euribor plus 45 basis points at december 31 2008 this discretionary line of credit has no expiration date our credit agreement contains certain financial covenants but does not restrict the payment of dividends we were in compliance with all covenants of this agreement as of december 31 2008 

assuming no change in our current business plan management believes that our available cash together with expected future cash generated from operations and the amount available under our line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital capital expenditures and cash dividends in future periods we also believe we could obtain funds under additional lines of credit on short notice if needed 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majorityowned subsidiaries the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes in preparing our financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements giving due consideration to materiality we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below however application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and as a result actual results could differ from these estimates note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 

revenue recognition gross revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers gross profits are gross revenues less the direct costs of transportation products and handling we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered at that time our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent establishes the criteria for recognizing revenues on a gross or net basis most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell in these transactions we are the primary obligor we are a principal to the transaction we have all credit risk we maintain substantially all risks and rewards we have discretion to select the supplier and we have latitude in pricing decisions 

additionally in our sourcing business we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk certain transactions in customs brokerage transportation management and all transactions in information services are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present 

valuations for accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables our historical experience of uncollectible accounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified the allowance of 293 million as of december 31 2008 increased compared to the allowance of 280 million as of december 31 2007 we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends the exposures we have identified and our historical loss experience 

goodwill we manage and report our operations as one operating segment our branches represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprisewide basis in the case where we have an acquisition that we feel has not yet become integrated into our branch network component we will evaluate the impairment of any goodwill related to that specific acquisition and its results based on our annual analysis in accordance with sfas no 142 we have determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of december 31 2008 

stockbased compensation we account for sharebased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r share based payment under this standard the fair value of each sharebased payment award is established on the date of grant for grants of restricted shares and restricted units the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant discounted for postvesting holding restrictions the discounts have varied from 12 to 22 percent and are calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model increased stock price volatility is the primary factor that has caused the change in the discount applied for grants of options we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards the determination of the fair value of sharebased awards is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected volatility expected life riskfree interest rate and expected dividends 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements

the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31 2008 

payments due by period dollars in thousands 

 

  

  we have no longterm debt or capital lease obligations longterm liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable and the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2008 we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority therefore 99 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes the obligation under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain we also enter into air and ocean freight and produce purchase contracts which are all shortterm in nature these liabilities have been excluded from the table as the amount of any cash payment is uncertain as of december 31 2008 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303 a4ii of sec regulation sk 

 

 we had 4973 million of cash and investments on december 31 2008 consisting of 4947 million of cash and cash equivalents and 26 million of availableforsale securities although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer substantially all of the cash equivalents are money market securities from treasury and tax exempt money issuers all of our availableforsale securities are highquality bonds that are exempt from us federal income taxes because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our investments

 item 1 business tableend overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2007 gross revenues of 73 billion we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2007 including our transportation management services business we handled approximately 65 million shipments for more than 29000 customers we operate through a network of 218 offices which we call branches in north america europe asia and south america we have developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide as a result we have the capability of managing most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

we are a nonasset based transportation provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers’ freight through our relationships with approximately 48000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers we select and hire the appropriate transportation to manage our customers’ freight needs being nonasset based means we can be flexible and focus on seeking solutions that work for our customers rather than focusing on asset utilization as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as supply chain analysis freight consolidation core carrier program management and information reporting 

in addition to multimodal transportation services we have two other logistics business lines fresh produce sourcing and feebased information services 

sourcing the buying selling and marketing of fresh produce was our original business when we were founded in 1905 much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities we purchase fresh produce through our network of independent produce suppliers our customers include regional and national grocery retailers and restaurants produce wholesalers and foodservice distributors in most cases we also arrange the transport of the fresh produce we sell through our relationships with owners of specialized transportation equipment we have developed our own brands of produce including the fresh 1 ® and ourworld ® organics and also have entered into licensing agreements to distribute produce under other national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures as part of our sourcing business 

information services our third business line is comprised of a ch robinson subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are primarily motor carriers for which it provides a variety of management and information services such as fuel management services funds transfer permit procurement fuel and use tax reporting and driver funds transfer for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller transfers funds to the truck stop and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

our business model has been the main driver of our strong historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our branch network of 218 offices staffed by approximately 5700 salespeople these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations approximately 30 of our truckload shipments are shared transactions between branches our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches our north american branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by expanding current offices opening new branch offices and hiring additional salespeople we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in july 2007 we completed the acquisition of lxsi services inc a thirdparty domestic air and expedited services provider based in los angeles california lxsi had gross revenues of approximately 25 million in 2006 

multimodal transportation services 

ch robinson is a third party logistics company we provide freight transportation and logistics services we are a nonasset based provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight we make a profit or margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation provider to handle or transport the freight 

we can arrange all of the following modes of transportation 

 

  

  

  

  

 customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the branch salesperson responsible for their account customers communicate with us by means of telephone fax internet email or edi electronic data interchange the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is entered into our proprietary operating system with the help of information provided by the operating system the salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the shipment and selects a carrier or carriers based upon his or her knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different branch offices collaborate to hire the appropriate carrier for our customer’s freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the carrier to agree on the price for the transportation and the carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation we are in contact with the carrier through numerous means of communication edi chrwtruckscom ®  email verbal to provide tracking and status updates of the shipment through delivery our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer 

we are a principal in the transaction by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges in the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the carrier for the claims 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated approximate number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitment to handle the shipments is usually at specific rates subject to seasonal variation most of our rate commitments are for one year or less as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments which are sometimes called “must haul” requirements 

the majority of our truckload freight is priced to our carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can 

  

evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customer’s warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting feebased transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become key providers to our customers responsible for a greater portion of their supply chain management we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included as part of our audited consolidated financial statements for an allocation of our gross revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation gross profits 

in thousands 

 

  

  transportation services accounted for approximately 88 of our gross profits in 2007 and 87 in 2006 and 2005 

sourcing 

throughout our 102year history we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in many instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

for several years we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base by focusing on large multistore grocery retailers restaurant chains and foodservice providers historically grocery retailers have relied primarily on regional or even local purchases from food wholesalers for produce sourcing and storelevel distribution as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation these methods have become inefficient our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers’ produce purchasing and provide consistent quality from region to region and store to store 

our sourcing services have expanded to include justintime replenishment commodity management and business analysis we have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands the fresh 1® fresh’n easy® our world® organics tropic sweet® tomorrow’s® organics and kensington farms® and licensed brands mott’s® tropicana® welch’s® glory foods® and bambino® these programs contain a wide variety of fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables that are high in quality these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred supplier programs 

  

sourcing accounted for approximately 8 of our gross profits in 2007 and 9 in 2006 and 2005 

information services 

information services is comprised of a subsidiary of ch robinson tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are primarily motor carriers and truck stop chains tchek provides its motor carrier customers with fuel management services funds transfer fuel and use tax reporting driver payroll services permits and online access to customtailored information management reports all through the use of its proprietary automated systems these systems enable motor carriers to track equipment manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

information services accounted for approximately 4 of our gross profits in 2007 2006 and 2005 

organization 

to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices which we call “branches” we currently have 218 branches up from 214 in 2006 our branches are supported by executives and other centralized shared services approximately 10 of our employees are corporate employees who provide these centralized shared services over onethird of these corporate employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network 

branch network 

we currently have branches in the following areas of the world 

 

 each branch is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire carriers to provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and third party sources such as industry directories salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new carriers who are qualified by our centralized carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and have the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis 

branch expansion we expect to continue to open new branch offices new branch offices are viewed as a longterm contributor to overall company growth in addition to market opportunity a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch additional branches are often opened within a geographic area previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch a modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space communications and hardware and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time we have also augmented our branch office network through selective acquisitions 

  

branch employees because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our hiring we recruit applicants from across north america europe asia and south america our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

early in their tenure most newly hired branch employees go through centralized training that emphasizes development of the necessary skills and customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training at the branch level we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks in addition each new salesperson attends an orientation within their first year of employment to further their knowledge of the company and have the opportunity to develop relationships with employees of other branches 

employees at the branch level form a team the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch or business unit branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year based on a system of “points” awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contributions employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our 401k plan in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time 

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan within that plan in 2003 we began regularly issuing restricted stock and restricted stock units as our primary equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating long term ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders for most restricted stock awards restricted shares and units are available to vest over five calendar years based on company performance 

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management national sales and national account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

executive officers 

under our decentralized business structure branch managers while retaining autonomy for their branch performance receive guidance and support from the executive officers at our central corporate office customers carriers managers and employees have direct access to our chief executive officer john wiehoff and all other executive officers these executives provide training and education develop new services and applications to be offered to customers share operations and management guidance and provide broad market analysis

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we had a total of 7332 employees of whom approximately 6600 were located in our branch offices services such as accounting information technology legal marketing communications human resource support credit and claims management and carrier services are supported centrally 

customers and marketing 

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2007 we served over 29000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2007 no customer accounted for more than 6 of gross revenues or 3 of gross profits in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we believe that our decentralized structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers with the guidance of experienced branch managers who have an average tenure of 12 years with us branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that we can provide we have also expanded our national sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities increasingly branches call on our executives our global sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing relationships with good transportation providers to assure dependable services favorable pricing and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we do not own any transportation equipment or employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success we rely on them to provide us with information regarding the status of shipments during transit and upon delivery 

  

as of december 31 2007 we had qualified approximately 48000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers serving their region and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for carriers to work with us we have a policy of prompt payment and offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip advances through our tchek subsidiary 

these motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds these carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one carrier our largest truckload carrier was less than 1 of our total cost of transportation in 2007 approximately 75 of our truckload shipments in 2007 were transported by motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors we qualify each carrier to make sure it is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federally issued authority to provide transportation services and that it has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners stacktrain operators and all class 1 railroads in north america giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis 

in our nonasset based ocean transportation nvocc and freight forwarding business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay our ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers specific trade lane requirements and anticipated growth in the international shipping marketplace these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

in our international air freight forwarding business we purchase transportation services from approximately 200 air carriers through charter services block space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements are annual contracts that include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed annually or throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of other nonasset based logistics companies assetbased logistics companies third party freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces we also buy and sell transportation services from and to companies that compete with us 

in our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups we also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us 

the primary business of our information services business which is comprised of our subsidiary tchek systems is fuel card services the fuel card processing industry is very consolidated and a small number of companies represent the majority of the market 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 communications and information systems 

our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate service our customers and carriers and manage our business our proprietary information systems help our employees efficiently manage more than 65 million shipments annually 29000 customer relationships and 48000 carrier relationships our employees are linked with each other and with our customers carriers and suppliers by telephone fax internet email andor edi to communicate shipment requirements and availability and to confirm and bill orders through our internet sites chrwonlinecom® and chrwtruckscom® customers and carriers can contract for shipments or equipment as well as track and trace shipments including delivery confirmation customers carriers and suppliers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the internet 

our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities communicate and coordinate activity with other branches and “crosscover” or find equipment for other branches’ freight our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate shipments and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems also make shipment data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers enabling our salespeople to select carriers and track shipments in progress our systems automatically provide alerts to arising problems our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers and carriers these reports provide them with information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and support analysis of their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute costs 

government regulation 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements under certain limited circumstances one of our subsidiary companies provides limited motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the dot including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc for which we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as an indirect air carrier of cargo subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements we generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

we source fresh produce under licenses issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations are subject to federal and state regulations including but not limited to the bank security act of 1970 

  

risk management and insurance 

we require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in auto and general liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including auto and general liability with a 100 million umbrella in 2007 and a 200 million umbrella in 2008 our contingent auto liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident for the years 2004 through 2006 and a retention of 3 million per incident for 2007 and 2008 

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover this type of risk in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which are generally not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary and licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

 item 1a risk factors tableend demand for our services may decrease during an economic recession  the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control if economic recession or a downturn in our customers’ business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage retail manufacturing paper or printing industries our operating results could be adversely affected 

higher carrier prices or fuel costs may result in decreased gross profit margin carriers can be expected to charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses and our gross profits and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of higher transportation costs 

we depend upon others to provide equipment and services we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers freight and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims this reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

 our international business raises additional difficulties we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

  

our ability to hire and retain additional people is important to the continued growth of our business our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals our growth may be limited if we cannot recruit and retain a sufficient number of people we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors our rapid expansion of operations has placed added demands on our management continued expansion depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad based we compete against other nonasset based logistics companies as well as logistics companies that own their own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services and internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our gross profit and income from operations 

we are reliant on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers we are reliant on our technology staff to successfully implement changes to our operating systems in an efficient manner computer viruses could cause an interruption to the availability of our systems unauthorized access to our systems with malicious intent could result in the theft of proprietary information and in systems outages an unplanned systems outage or unauthorized access to our systems could materially and adversely affect our business 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america south america europe and asia supported by executives and services in a central corporate office with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions and the growth of the business in their branch our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition certain of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies and their drivers in connection with our transportation operations from time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries the resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the carrier although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owner operators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our auto liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident for years 2004 through 2006 and a retention of 3 million per incident for 2007 and 2008  a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently 

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged 

  

contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages while we are insured for up to 101 million in 2007 and 201 million in 2008 for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product which our insurance does not cover any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond and by the transportation security administration as an independent air carrier we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal and state environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

we derive a significant portion of our gross revenues and gross profit from our largest clients our top 100 customers comprise approximately onethird of consolidated gross profits with none of them individually exceeding three percent the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all if we acquire a company we may have difficulty integrating its businesses products services technologies and personnel into our operations acquired companies or operations may have unexpected liabilities and we may face challenges in retaining significant customers of acquired companies these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price historically our longterm growth objective has been 15 for gross profits operating income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth our operating margins could be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic or political conditions slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend as we previously disclosed during 2002 we were named as a defendant in two lawsuits brought by a number of present and former employees the first lawsuit alleged a hostile working environment unequal pay promotions and opportunities for women and failure to pay overtime “flsa” the second lawsuit alleged a failure to pay overtime the plaintiffs in both lawsuits sought unspecified monetary and nonmonetary damages and class action certification 

on march 31 2005 the judge issued an order denying class certification for the hostile working environment claims and allowing class certification for certain claims of gender discrimination in pay and promotion the judge also granted our motions for summary judgment as to the hostile working environment claims of ten of the named plaintiffs and dismissed those claims the gender discrimination class claims and the remaining two hostile work environment claims were settled on april 11 2006 and subsequently approved by the court on september 18 2006 the settlement was within our insurance coverage limits and was fully funded by the insurance carriers 

the settlement of the gender discrimination class claims did not include the overtime pay lawsuits or the claims of putative class members who subsequently filed individual eeoc charges after the denial of class status on march 31 2005 54 of those eeoc claimants filed lawsuits fortythree of those suits have been settled or dismissed the settlement amount was not material to our financial position or results of operations we are vigorously defending the remaining 11 lawsuits 

  

although the gender class settlement was fully funded by the insurance carriers those carriers reserved the right to seek a court ruling that a portion of the settlement was not covered under their policies and also to dispute payment of certain defense costs incurred in that litigation insurance coverage litigation between us and one of our insurance carriers concerning these issues and insurance coverage for the individual lawsuits has been pending in minnesota state court recent court rulings have determined that the gender class settlement payment was appropriately covered under applicable policies and that the insurance carrier has a duty to reimburse reasonable defense costs in the gender class action and all but two of the individual lawsuits and to indemnify ch robinson in all but two of the individual lawsuits this ruling is subject to appeal 

with respect to the flsa overtime claims the judge issued an order granting in full our motion to decertify the flsa collective action on september 26 2006 the judge retained jurisdiction over the named plaintiffs’ flsa overtime claims and dismissed the claims of the optin plaintiffs without prejudice to their right to bring their own claims in separate lawsuits in appropriate venues approximately 525 of the dismissed optin plaintiffs either filed or joined in lawsuits asserting individual flsa claims for failure to pay overtime approximately 37 of those individuals have filed voluntary dismissals of their claims we have reached an agreement to settle all of the remaining lawsuits this agreement was approved by the court on february 20 2008 the settlement amount was not material to our financial position or results of operations 

we are not subject to any other pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 1 business tableend overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in the world with 2006 gross revenues of 66 billion we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2006 we handled approximately 52 million shipments for more than 25000 customers we operate through a network of 214 offices which we call branches in north america europe asia and south america we have developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide as a result we have the capability of managing most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

we are a nonasset based transportation provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers’ freight through our relationships with approximately 45000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers we select and hire the appropriate transportation to manage our customers’ freight needs being nonasset based means we can be flexible and focus on seeking solutions that work for our customers rather than focusing on asset utilization as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as supply chain analysis freight consolidation core carrier program management and information reporting 

in addition to multimodal transportation services we have two other logistics business lines fresh produce sourcing and feebased information services 

sourcing the buying selling and brokering of fresh produce was our original business when we were founded in 1905 much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers our customers include large grocery retailers produce wholesalers restaurants and foodservice distributors in the majority of cases we also arrange the transport of the fresh produce we sell through our relationships with owners of specialized transportation equipment in response to demand and changing market conditions we have developed our own brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  and also have entered into licensing agreements to distribute produce under other national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through various relationships and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures as part of our national brand programs 

information services our third business line is comprised of a ch robinson subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are motor carriers for which it provides a variety of management and information services such as fuel management services funds transfer fuel and use tax reporting and driver funds transfer for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller transfers funds to the truck stop and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

  

our business model has been the main driver of our strong historical results and has positioned us for continued growth one of our competitive advantages is our large branch network of 214 offices staffed by approximately 5200 salespeople these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and transportation providers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations over 30 of our transactions are shared transactions between branches our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches our north american branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by expanding current offices opening new branch offices and hiring additional salespeople we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in may 2006 we acquired certain assets of payne lynch  associates inc “payne lynch” a nonasset based third party logistics company that specializes in flatbed and over dimensional freight brokerage payne lynch had annual gross revenues of approximately 35 million in 2005 during the fourth quarter we acquired certain assets of triune freight private ltd and triune logistics private ltd collectively “triune” a third party logistics provider based in india triune has annual gross revenues of approximately 11 million 

multimodal transportation services 

ch robinson is a third party logistics company we provide freight transportation and logistics services we are a nonasset based provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight we make a profit or margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation provider also known as a “carrier” to transport the freight 

we can arrange all of the following modes of transportation on a worldwide basis 

 

  

  

  

  

 on a daytoday basis customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the branch salesperson responsible for their account customers communicate with us by means of telephone fax internet email or edi electronic data interchange the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is entered into our proprietary operating system with the help of information provided by the operating system the salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the shipment and selects a carrier or carriers based upon their knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different branch offices collaborate to hire the appropriate carrier for our customer’s freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the carrier to agree on the price for the transportation and the carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation at this point the salesperson provides the carrier information to the customer we then remain in contact with the carrier mainly by phone calls with the driver and rely on them to provide us status updates of the shipment through delivery our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer 

  

we are a principal in the transaction by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges in the cases where we have agreed to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the carrier for the claims 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated approximate number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitment to handle the shipments is usually at specific rates subject to seasonal variation most of our rate commitments are for one year or less as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments or “must haul” requirements 

the majority of our truckload freight is priced to our carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customer’s warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become key providers to our customers responsible for a greater portion of their supply chain management we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included as part of our audited consolidated financial statements for an allocation of our gross revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2006 and 2005 in the united states and in foreign locations 

  

the table below shows our gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation gross profits 

in thousands 

 

   transportation services accounted for approximately 87 of our gross profits in 2006 2005 and 2004 

sourcing 

throughout our 101year history we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in most instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

for several years we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base by focusing on large multistore grocery retailers restaurant chains and foodservice providers traditionally grocery retailers have relied mainly on regional or even local purchases from food wholesalers for produce sourcing and storelevel distribution as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation these methods have become inefficient our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers’ produce purchasing and provide uniform quality from region to region and store to store 

our sourcing services have expanded to include justintime replenishment commodity management and business analysis in response to demand and changing market conditions we have a proprietary brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  which includes a wide range of fruits and vegetables that are uniform in quality and top grade and branded produce programs including licensing agreements to distribute produce under major national brands these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with some of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred supplier programs our acquisitions of the foodsource entities in 2005 further expanded our service capabilities in sourcing 

sourcing accounted for approximately 9 of our gross profits in 2006 and 2005 and approximately 8 of our gross profits in 2004 

information services 

information services is comprised of a subsidiary of ch robinson tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are motor carriers and truck stop chains tchek provides its motor carrier customers with fuel management services funds transfer fuel and use tax reporting driver payroll services permits and online access to customtailored information management reports all through the use of its proprietary automated systems these systems enable motor carriers to track equipment manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

information services accounted for approximately 4 of our gross profits in 2006 and 2005 and 5 of our gross profits in 2004 

  

organization 

to keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices which we call “branches” we currently have 214 offices up from 196 in 2005 our branches are supported by executives and other centralized shared services approximately 11 of our employees are corporate employees who provide these centralized shared services over onethird of the corporate employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network 

branch network 

each branch office is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire carriers to provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and third party sources such as industry directories salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new carriers who are qualified by our centralized carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and have the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis 

branch expansion we expect to continue to open new branch offices new branch offices are viewed as a longterm contributor to overall company growth in addition to market opportunity a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch additional branches are often opened within a territory previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch a modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space communications and hardware and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time we have also augmented our growth through selective acquisitions 

branch employees because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our hiring we recruit applicants from across north america europe asia and south america our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

newly hired branch employees go through onthejob training at the branch level that emphasizes development of the necessary skills and customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks in addition each new salesperson attends a national training meeting to further their skills and have the opportunity to develop relationships with employees of other branches 

employees at the branch level form a team the team structure is motivated by our performancebased compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch or business unit branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year based on a system of “points” awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contributions employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our 401k plan in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time 

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan within that plan in 2003 we began regularly issuing restricted stock and restricted stock units as our primary equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating long term ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders for most restricted stock awards restricted shares and units are available to vest over five calendar years based on company performance 

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management national sales and national account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees

as of december 31 2006 we had a total of 6768 employees of whom approximately 6000 were located in our branch offices services such as accounting information technology legal marketing communications human resource support credit and claims management and carrier services are supported centrally 

  

customers and marketing 

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2006 we served over 25000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2006 no customer accounted for more than 7 of gross revenues or 3 of gross profits in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we believe that our decentralized structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers with the guidance of experienced branch managers who have an average tenure of 11 years with us branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that we can provide we have also expanded our national sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities increasingly branches call on our executives our global sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with transportation providers 

we continually work on establishing relationships with good transportation providers to assure dependable services favorable pricing and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply because we don’t own any transportation equipment or employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success we rely on them to provide us with information regarding the status of shipments during transit and upon delivery 

as of december 31 2006 we had qualified approximately 45000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are motor carriers to strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers serving their region and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for carriers to work with us we have a policy of prompt payment and offer payment within 48 hours in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip advances through our tchek subsidiary 

these motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds these carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one carrier our largest truckload carrier was less than 1 of our total cost of transportation in 2006 approximately 75 of our shipments in 2006 were transported by motor carriers that had less than 100 tractors we qualify each carrier to make sure it is properly licensed and insured has an adequate safety rating and that it has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages to fulfill regulatory requirements our motor carrier contracts commit to a series of three shipments and an initial transportation rate our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

we also have intermodal marketing contracts with railroads including all of the major north american railroads giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis 

in our nonasset based ocean transportation nvocc and freight forwarding business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers we negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay our ocean carriers the rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers specific trade lane requirements and anticipated growth in the international shipping marketplace these contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes 

in our international air freight forwarding business we purchase transportation services from approximately 200 air carriers through charter services block space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements our block space agreements are annual contracts that include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed annually or throughout the year the transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of other nonasset based logistics companies assetbased logistics companies third party freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ own transportation departments we also buy and sell transportation services from and to companies that compete with us 

  

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 communications and information systems 

our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate service our customers and carriers and manage our business our proprietary information systems help our employees efficiently manage more than 52 million shipments annually 25000 customer relationships and 45000 carrier relationships our employees are linked with each other and with our customers and our carriers by telephone fax internet email andor edi to communicate shipment requirements and availability and to confirm and bill orders through our internet sites chrwonlinecom and chrwtruckscom customers and carriers can contract for shipments or equipment as well as track and trace shipments including delivery confirmation customers and carriers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the internet 

our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities communicate and coordinate activity with other branches and “crosscover” or find equipment for other branches’ freight our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate shipments and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems also make shipment data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers enabling our salespeople to select carriers and track shipments in progress our systems automatically provide alerts to arising problems our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers these reports provide them with information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and support analysis of their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute costs 

government regulation 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements under certain circumstances one of our subsidiary companies provides limited motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the dot including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nonvessel operating common carrier for which we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each we operate as an indirect air cargo carrier subject to economic regulation by the dot and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture as required by the perishable agricultural commodities act “paca” other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations are subject to federal and state money transfer regulations under the usa patriot act of 2001 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to licensing registration or permit requirements we generally rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance 

  

with these types of requirements we along with the carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

risk management and insurance 

we require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in auto and general liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance many carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including auto and general liability with a 100 million umbrella our contingent auto liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident for the years 2004 through 2006 and a retention of 3 million per incident for 2007 

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover this type of risk in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product which is generally not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our the fresh 1 ® and other licensed brands loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

 item 1a risk factors tableend demand for our services may decrease during an economic recession  the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers fuel shortages price increases by carriers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control carriers can be expected to charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses and our gross profits and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of higher transportation costs if economic recession or a downturn in our customers’ business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage paper or printing industries our operating results could also be adversely affected 

we depend upon others to provide equipment and services we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers freight and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims this reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

 our international business raises additional difficulties we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to hire additional people is important to the continued growth of our business our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals our growth may be limited if we cannot recruit and retain a sufficient number of people we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors our rapid expansion of operations has placed added demands on our management continued expansion depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

  

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad based we compete against other nonasset based logistics companies as well as logistics companies that own their own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services and internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ transportation departments we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our gross profit and income from operations 

we are reliant on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers we are reliant on our technology staff to successfully implement changes to our operating systems in an efficient manner computer viruses could cause an interruption to the availability of our systems unauthorized access to our systems with malicious intent could result in the theft of proprietary information and in systems outages an unplanned systems outage or unauthorized access to our systems could materially and adversely affect our business 

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america south america europe and asia supported by executives and services in a central corporate office with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions and the growth of the business in their branch our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition certain of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies and their drivers in connection with our transportation operations from time to time these drivers are involved in accidents and the carrier may not have adequate insurance coverage although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owner operators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our auto liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident for years 2004 through 2006 and a retention of 3 million per incident for 2007  a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by government food safety regulation growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently 

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may have legal responsibility arising from the sale while we are insured for up to 100 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product which our insurance does not cover any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our produce brand the fresh 1 ® or one of our other licensed branded products loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond 

  

we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal and state environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

we derive a significant portion of our gross revenues and gross profit from our largest clients our top 100 customers comprise approximately onethird of consolidated gross profits with none of them individually exceeding 3 percent the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all if we acquire a company we may have difficulty integrating its businesses products services technologies and personnel into our operations acquired companies or operations may have unexpected liabilities and we may face challenges in retaining significant customers of acquired companies these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  historically our longterm growth objective has been 15 for gross profits operating income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth our operating margins could be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic or political conditions slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend as we previously disclosed during 2002 we were named as a defendant in two lawsuits brought by a number of present and former employees the first lawsuit alleged a hostile working environment unequal pay promotions and opportunities for women and failure to pay overtime “flsa” the second lawsuit alleges a failure to pay overtime the plaintiffs in both lawsuits sought unspecified monetary and nonmonetary damages and class action certification 

on march 31 2005 the judge issued an order denying class certification for the hostile working environment claims and allowing class certification for certain claims of gender discrimination in pay and promotion the judge also granted our motions for summary judgment as to the hostile working environment claims of ten of the named plaintiffs and dismissed those claims 

the gender discrimination class claims and the remaining two hostile work environment claims were settled in principle on april 11 2006 and received final approval by the court on september 18 2006 the settlement consists of 15 million for all damages costs and attorneys’ fees to be allocated as determined by the court the proposed settlement also includes programmatic relief offered by us as a condition of the settlement we made no admission of liability the 15 million is within our insurance coverage limits and has been fully funded by the insurance carriers although it has been fully funded by the insurance carriers those carriers reserved the right to seek a court ruling that a portion of the settlement was not covered under their policies and also to dispute payment of certain defense costs incurred in that litigation these insurance issues are discussed below as “class coverage issues” 

the settlement of the gender discrimination class claims did not include the overtime pay lawsuits or the claims of putative class members who subsequently filed individual eeoc charges after the denial of class status on march 31 2005 currently fiftytwo of those claimants have filed lawsuits of those one was tried to a jury and resulted in a defense verdict one was voluntarily dismissed and one was dismissed on our motion for summary judgment an appeal of that dismissal is pending we are vigorously defending the remaining charges and lawsuits and have been advised by plaintiffs’ counsel that no further lawsuits are expected to be filed 

insurance coverage litigation has been commenced between us and one of our insurance carriers concerning the abovereferenced class coverage issues and also concerning insurance coverage for the individual lawsuits countersuits seeking a declaratory judgment on these insurance issues are currently pending in minnesota state court we are vigorously asserting its claims for maximum insurance coverage both for the class coverage issues and for the defense and indemnity of the individual suits 

with respect to the flsa overtime claims the judge issued an order granting in full our motion to decertify the flsa collective action on september 26 2006 the judge retained jurisdiction over the named plaintiffs’ flsa overtime claims and 

  

dismissed the claims of the optin plaintiffs without prejudice to their right to bring their own claims in separate lawsuits in appropriate venues approximately 525 of the dismissed optin plaintiffs either filed or joined in lawsuits asserting individual flsa claims for failure to pay overtime approximately five of those individuals have filed voluntary dismissals of their claims we are vigorously defending the remaining lawsuits in various federal courts 

currently the amount of any loss from the individual gender or flsa claims is not expected to be material to us however unfavorable developments could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements we are not subject to any other pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 1 business 

overview 

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in north america with 2005 gross revenues of 57 billion we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2005 we handled approximately 44 million shipments for more than 20500 customers we operate through a network of 196 offices which we call branches in north america south america europe and asia we have developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide as a result we have the capability of managing most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

we are a nonasset based transportation provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers’ freight through our relationships with approximately 40000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers we select and hire the appropriate transportation to manage our customers’ freight needs being nonasset based means we can be flexible and focus on seeking solutions that work for our customers rather than focusing on asset utilization as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as supply chain analysis freight consolidation core carrier program management and information reporting 

in addition to multimodal transportation services we have two other logistics business lines fresh produce sourcing and feebased information services 

sourcing the buying selling and brokering of fresh produce was our original business when we were founded in 1905 much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers our customers include large grocery retailers produce wholesalers restaurants and foodservice distributors in the majority of cases we also arrange the transport of the fresh produce we sell through our relationships with owners of specialized transportation equipment in response to demand and changing market conditions we have developed our own brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  and also have entered into licensing agreements to distribute produce under national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through various relationships and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures as part of our national brand programs 

information services our third business line is comprised of a ch robinson subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are motor carriers for which it provides a variety of management and information services such as fuel management services funds transfer fuel and use tax reporting and driver payroll services for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller transfers funds to the truck stop and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

our business model has been the main driver of our strong historical results and has positioned us for continued growth our principal competitive advantage is our large branch network of 196 offices staffed by approximately 4400 salespeople these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and carriers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and carriers’ changing needs employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations over 30 of our transactions are shared transactions between branches our branches work together to complete transactions and collectively meet the needs of our customers for our top 100 customers who comprise approximately onethird of our gross profits we often coordinate our efforts in one branch and rely on multiple branch locations to deliver specific geographic or modal needs in addition our methodology of providing services is very similar across all branches our north american branches have a common technology platform that they use to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other branch locations and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative 

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by expanding current offices opening new branch offices and hiring additional salespeople we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in february 2005 we acquired the operations and certain assets of three produce sourcing and marketing companies foodsource inc foodsource procurement llc and epic roots inc collectively the “foodsource entities” these entities had annual revenues of approximately 270 million in 2004 during the third quarter we acquired two freight forwarding businesses in separate transactions hirdes group worldwide “hirdes” and bussini transport srl “bussini” the two companies combined had gross revenues of approximately 52 million in 2004 

  

hirdes provides air and ocean international forwarding with local cartage and operates in germany and the united states bussini provides air and ocean international freight forwarding customs brokerage and domestic truck services it is based in milan italy these companies now operate as nine different branches 

multimodal transportation services 

ch robinson is a third party logistics company we provide freight transportation and logistics services we are a nonasset based provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight we make a profit or margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation provider also known as a “carrier” to transport the freight 

we can arrange all of the following modes of transportation on a worldwide basis 

 

  

  

  

  

 on a daytoday basis customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the branch salesperson responsible for their account customers communicate with us by means of telephone fax internet email or edi electronic data interchange the branch employee ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is entered into our proprietary operating system with the help of information provided by the operating system the salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the shipment and selects a carrier or carriers based upon their knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a carrier directly before setting a price in many cases employees from different branch offices collaborate to match the appropriate carrier to the customer’s freight and the branch offices agree to an internal profit split 

once the carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the carrier to agree on the price for the transportation and the carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation at this point the salesperson provides the carrier information to the customer we then remain in contact with the carrier mainly by phone calls with the driver and rely on them to provide us status updates of the shipment through delivery our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer 

we are a principal in the transaction by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges in the cases where we have agreed to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the carrier for the claims 

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated approximate number of shipments 

  

usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitment to handle the shipments is usually at specific rates subject to seasonal variation most of our rate commitments are for one year or less as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments or “must haul” requirements 

the majority of our truckload freight is priced to our carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract 

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customer’s warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become business partners with our customers responsible for a greater portion of their supply chain management we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included as part of our audited consolidated financial statements for an allocation of our gross revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2005 and 2004 in the united states and in foreign locations 

the table below shows our gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

transportation gross profits 

in thousands 

 

   transportation services accounted for approximately 87 of our gross profits in 2005 and 2004 and approximately 85 in 2003 

sourcing 

throughout our 100year history we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by retailers wholesalers foodservice companies and restaurants in most instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

  

during the past decade we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base by focusing on large multistore grocery retailers restaurant chains and foodservice providers traditionally grocery retailers have relied mainly on regional or even local purchases from food wholesalers for produce sourcing and storelevel distribution as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation these methods have become inefficient our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers’ produce purchasing and provide uniform quality from region to region and store to store 

our sourcing services have expanded to include justintime replenishment commodity management and business analysis in response to demand and changing market conditions we introduced our proprietary brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  which includes a wide range of fruits and vegetables that are uniform in quality and top grade since 1998 we have entered into new branded produce programs including licensing agreements to distribute produce under major national brands these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with some of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our national brand programs our acquisitions of the foodsource entities in 2005 further expanded our service capabilities in sourcing 

sourcing accounted for approximately 9 of our gross profits in 2005 8 of our gross profits in 2004 and approximately 10 in 2003 

information services 

information services is comprised of a subsidiary of ch robinson tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are motor carriers and truck stop chains tchek provides its motor carrier customers with fuel management services funds transfer fuel and use tax reporting driver payroll services permits and online access to customtailored information management reports all through the use of its proprietary automated systems these systems enable motor carriers to track equipment manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

information services accounted for approximately 4 of our gross profits in 2005 and 5 of our gross profits in 2004 and 2003 

organization 

to keep us close to our customers and markets we have created and continue to expand a network of 196 offices which we call “branches” our branches are supported by executives and other centralized shared services approximately 11 of our employees are corporate employees who provide these centralized shared services nearly half of the corporate employees are information technology personnel who develop and maintain our proprietary operating system software and our wide area network 

branch network 

each branch office is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire carriers provide transportation branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international ocean and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and third party sources such as industry directories salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new carriers who are qualified by our carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and have the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis 

branch expansion we expect to continue to open new branch offices new branch offices are viewed as a longterm contributor to overall company growth in addition to market opportunity a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch additional branches are often opened within a 

  

territory previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch a modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space communications and hardware and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time we have also augmented our growth through selective acquisitions 

branch employees because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our hiring we recruit applicants from across north america south america europe and asia our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

newly hired branch employees go through onthejob training at the branch level that emphasizes development of the necessary skills and customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks in addition each new salesperson attends a national training meeting to further their skills and have the opportunity to develop relationships with employees of other branches 

employees at the branch level form a team the team structure is motivated by our incentive compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch or business unit branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year based on a system of “points” awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contributions employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our profit sharing plan in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time 

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan to promote longterm share ownership in 2005 930 employees were awarded a total of 2394290 restricted stock units or shares in 2004 577 employees were awarded a total of 298116 restricted stock units or shares in 2003 656 employees were awarded a total of 1732050 restricted stock units or shares employees at all levels after a qualifying period of employment are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan 

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management national sales and national account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

executive officers

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we had a total of 5776 employees of whom 5100 were located in our branch offices services such as accounting information technology legal marketing communications human resource support credit and claims management are supported centrally 

customers and marketing 

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2005 we served over 20500 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2005 no customer accounted for more than 65 of gross revenues or 33 of gross profits in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers 

we believe that our decentralized structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers with the guidance of experienced branch managers who have an average tenure of 11 years with us branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that we can provide we have also expanded our national sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities increasingly branches call on our executives our global sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with carriers 

we continually work on establishing relationships with good carriers to assure dependable services favorable pricing and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply to strengthen and maintain our relationships with carriers our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers 

  

serving their region and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for carriers to work with us we have a policy of prompt payment and offer payment within 48 hours in exchange for a discount 

as of december 31 2005 we had qualified approximately 40000 carriers worldwide of which the vast majority are motor carriers these carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds these carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one carrier our largest truckload carrier was less than 2 of our total cost of transportation in 2005 we qualify each carrier to make sure it is properly licensed and insured has an adequate safety rating and that it has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages to fulfill regulatory requirements our motor carrier contracts commit to a series of three shipments and an initial transportation rate our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier 

as of december 31 2005 we also had intermodal marketing contracts with railroads including all of the major north american railroads giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis 

because we don’t own any transportation equipment or employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight these relationships are critical to our success and we rely on them to provide us with information regarding the status of shipments during transit and upon delivery delays in these communications could cause us to record transactions late because we recognize revenue when we know our services are completed we have developed systems and controls to make these status updates as efficient and timely as possible for us and the carrier 

competition 

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of other nonasset based logistics companies assetbased logistics companies third party freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ own transportation departments we also buy and sell transportation services from and to companies with which we compete 

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 communications and information systems 

our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate service our customers and carriers and manage our business our proprietary information systems help our employees efficiently manage more than 44 million shipments annually 20500 customer relationships and 40000 carrier relationships our employees are linked with each other and with our customers and our carriers by telephone fax internet email andor edi to communicate shipment requirements and availability and to confirm and bill orders through our internet sites chrwonlinecom and 

  

chrwtruckscom customers and carriers can contract shipments or equipment and track and trace shipments including delivery confirmation customers and carriers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the internet 

our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities communicate and coordinate activity with other branches and “crosscover” or find equipment for other branches’ freight our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate shipments and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems also make shipment data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers enabling our salespeople to select carriers and track shipments in progress our systems automatically provide visible alerts to arising problems our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers these reports provide them with information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and support analysis of their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute costs 

government regulation 

the transportation industry has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes that have affected the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and cost of providing transportation services  we do not believe that these new regulations have had a material impact on our business and we cannot predict the effect if any that future legislative and regulatory changes may have on the transportation industry 

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements under certain circumstances one of our subsidiary companies provides limited motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the dot including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and we maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond we operate as an indirect air cargo carrier subject to economic regulation by the dot and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection 

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations are subject to federal and state money transfer regulations under the usa patriot act of 2001 

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to licensing registration or permit requirements we generally rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

risk management and insurance 

we require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in general liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance many carriers carry insurance limits exceeding these minimums railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including auto and general liability with a 100 million umbrella our contingent auto liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident 

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about 

  

particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover this type of risk in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product which is generally not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our the fresh 1 ® and other licensed brands loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

you should consider carefully the following cautionary statements if you own our common stock or are planning to buy our common stock we intend to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” by providing this discussion we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results except to the extent required by law 




 item 1a risk factors 

demand for our services may decrease during an economic recession  the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers fuel shortages price increases by carriers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control carriers can be expected to charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses and our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of higher transportation costs if economic recession or a downturn in our customers’ business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage paper or printing industries our operating results could also be adversely affected 

we depend upon others to provide equipment and services we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers freight and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims this reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

 

   

  

  

 our international business raises additional difficulties we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

our ability to hire additional people is important to the continued growth of our business our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals our growth may be limited if we cannot recruit and retain a sufficient number of people we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors our rapid expansion of operations has placed added demands on our management continued expansion depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad based we compete against other nonasset based logistics companies as well as logistics companies that own their own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services and internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ transportation departments we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors increased competition could create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our gross profit and income from operations 

we are reliant on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers we are reliant on our technology staff to successfully implement changes to our operating systems in an efficient manner computer viruses could cause an interruption to the availability of our systems unauthorized access to our systems with malicious intent could result in the theft of proprietary information and in systems outages an unplanned systems outage or unauthorized access to our systems could materially and adversely affect our business 

  

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america south america europe and asia supported by executives and services in a central corporate office with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions and the growth of the business in their branch our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition certain of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies and their drivers in connection with our transportation operations from time to time these drivers are involved in accidents and the carrier may not have adequate insurance coverage although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owner operators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our auto liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability 

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by government food safety regulation growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently 

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may have legal responsibility arising from the sale while we are insured for up to 100 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product which our insurance does not cover any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our produce brand the fresh 1 ® or one of our other licensed branded products loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal and state environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

  

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

we derive a significant portion of our gross revenues and gross profit from our largest clients the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all if we acquire a company we may have difficulty integrating its businesses products services technologies and personnel into our operations acquired companies or operations may have unexpected liabilities and we may face challenges in retaining significant customers of acquired companies these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  historically our longterm growth objective has been 15 for gross profits operating income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth our operating margins could be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic or political conditions slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

overview 

  

ch robinson worldwide inc “ch robinson” “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest third party logistics companies in north america with 2004 gross revenues of 43 billion we provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries during 2004 we handled approximately 38 million shipments for more than 18000 customers we operate through a network of 176 offices which we call branches in north america south america europe and asia we have developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide as a result we have the capability of managing all aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers 

  

we are a nonasset based transportation provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment that is used to transport our customers’ freight through our relationships with approximately 35000 transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers we select and hire the appropriate transportation to manage our customers’ freight needs being nonasset based means we can be flexible and focus on seeking solutions that work for our customers rather than focusing on asset utilization as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as supply chain analysis freight consolidation core carrier program management and information reporting 

  

in addition to multimodal transportation services we have two other logistics business lines fresh produce sourcing and feebased information services 

  

sourcing the buying selling and brokering of fresh produce was our original business when we were founded in 1905 much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers our customers include produce wholesalers large grocery retailers restaurants and foodservice distributors in the majority of cases we also arrange the transport of the fresh produce we sell through our relationships with owners of specialized transportation equipment in response to demand and changing market conditions we have developed our own brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  and have entered into licensing agreements for national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through various relationships and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures as part of our national brand programs 

  

information services our third business line is comprised of a ch robinson subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are motor carriers for which it provides a variety of management and information services such as funds transfer driver payroll services fuel management services and fuel and use tax reporting for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller transfers funds to the truck stop and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

  

our business model has been the main driver of our strong historical results and has positioned us for continued growth our principal competitive advantage is our large decentralized branch network of 176 offices staffed by approximately 3500 salespeople these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and carriers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and carriers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative 

  

historically we have grown primarily through internal growth by expanding current offices opening new branch offices and hiring additional salespeople we have augmented our growth through selective acquisitions in february 2004 we acquired camway transportation corporation “camway” a third party logistics company based in toledo ohio that provides domestic truckload and intermodal transportation brokerage services camway had annual gross revenues of approximately 17 million in 2003 in june 2004 we opened seven offices in china acquired selected assets and hired people from one of our agents in those seven cities in december 2004 we acquired certain assets of us traffic corporation “us traffic” a third party logistics company based in lindon utah that provides domestic truckload and intermodal transportation brokerage services us traffic had annual gross revenues of approximately 27 million in 2004 in february 2005 we acquired the operations and certain assets of three produce sourcing and marketing companies foodsource inc foodsource procurement llc and epic roots inc these entities had annual revenues of approximately 270 million in 2004 

  

multimodal transportation services 

  

ch robinson is a third party logistics company we provide freight transportation and logistics services we are a nonasset based provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight we make a profit or margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation provider also known as a “carrier” to transport the freight 

  

we can arrange all of the following modes of transportation on a worldwide basis 

  

   

   

   

   

   

on a daytoday basis customers communicate their freight needs typically on a loadbyload basis to the branch office salesperson responsible for their account they communicate with us by means of telephone fax internet email or edi electronic data interchange the branch employee enters all appropriate information about each load into our proprietary operating system with the help of information provided by the operating system the salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the load and selects a carrier or carriers based upon their knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a carrier directly before setting a price once the carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the carrier’s dispatch office to agree on the price for the transportation and the carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation at this point the salesperson provides the carrier information to the customer we then remain in contact with the carrier mainly by phone calls with the driver and rely on them to provide us status updates of the shipment through delivery our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer 

  

we are a principal in the transaction by accepting the customer’s order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the load from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges also we usually are responsible to our customer for any claims for damage to freight while in transit or performance in most cases we receive reimbursement from the carrier for these claims 

  

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated approximate number of loads usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitment to handle the loads is usually at specific rates subject to seasonal variation most of our rate commitments are for one year or less as is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments or “must haul” requirements 

  

the majority of our truckload freight is priced to our carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis in a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport contracted loads for the length of our customer contract 

  

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we 

  

will analyze the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customer’s warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

  

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become business partners with our customers responsible for a greater portion of their supply chain management we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see note 1 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included as part of our audited consolidated financial statements for an allocation of our gross revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2004 and 2003 in the united states and in foreign locations 

  

the table below shows our gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

  

transportation gross profits 

in thousands 

  

    

   

transportation services accounted for approximately 87 of our gross profits in 2004 and approximately 85 in 2003 and 2002 

  

sourcing 

  

throughout our 100year history we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be quickly packaged transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment and distributed quickly to replenish high turnover inventories maintained by wholesalers foodservice companies restaurants and retailers in most instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

  

during the past decade we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base by focusing on large multistore grocery retailers traditionally grocery retailers have relied mainly on regional or even local purchases from food wholesalers for produce sourcing and storelevel distribution as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation these methods have become inefficient our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers’ produce purchasing and provide uniform quality from region to region and store to store our sourcing services have expanded to include justintime replenishment commodity management and business analysis in response to demand and changing market conditions we introduced our proprietary brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  which includes a wide range of fruits and vegetables 

  

that are uniform in quality and top grade since 1998 we have entered into new branded produce programs including licensing agreements for major national brands these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with some of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our national brand programs 

  

sourcing accounted for approximately 8 of our gross profits in 2004 and approximately 10 in 2003 and 2002 

  

information services 

  

information services is comprised of a subsidiary of ch robinson tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are motor carriers and truck stop chains tchek provides its motor carrier customers with funds transfer and driver payroll services fuel management services fuel and use tax reporting and online access to customtailored information management reports all through the use of its proprietary automated systems these systems enable motor carriers to track equipment manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

  

information services accounted for approximately 5 of our gross profits in each of 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

organization 

  

to keep us close to our customers and markets we have created and continue to expand a network of 176 offices which we call “branches” our branches are supported by executives and other centralized shared services approximately 13 of our employees are corporate employees who provide these centralized shared services 

  

branch network 

  

each branch office is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire carriers to transport loads branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

  

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and third party sources such as industry directories salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new carriers who are qualified by our carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and have the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis 

  

branch expansion we expect to continue to open new branch offices new branch offices are viewed as a longterm contributor to overall company growth in addition to market opportunity a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch additional branches are often opened within a territory previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch a modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space communications and hardware and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time we have also augmented our growth through selective acquisitions 

  

branch employees because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our hiring we recruit applicants from across north america south america europe and asia our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

  

newly hired branch employees go through onthejob training at the branch level which ranges from six months to a year and emphasizes development of the necessary skills and customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks after approximately a year of experience each salesperson attends our national training meeting to get additional training and have the opportunity to develop relationships with employees of other branches 

  

employees at the branch level form a team the team structure is motivated by our incentive compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of 

  

their particular branch or business unit branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year based on a system of “points” awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contributions employees can also receive profit sharing contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our profit sharing plan in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time 

  

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan to promote longterm share ownership in 2004 577 employees were awarded a total of 149058 restricted stock units or shares in 2003 656 employees were awarded a total of 866025 restricted stock units or shares employees at all levels after a qualifying period of employment are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan 

  

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management national sales and national account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

  

executive officers 

  

under our decentralized business structure branch managers while retaining autonomy for their branch performance receive guidance and support from the executive officers at our central corporate office customers carriers managers and employees have direct access to our chief executive officer john wiehoff and all other executive officers these executives provide training and education develop new services and applications to be offered to customers share operations and management guidance and provide broad market analysis

as of december 31 2004 we had qualified approximately 35000 motor carriers worldwide these motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds these carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one carrier our largest truckload carrier was less than 2 of our total purchased truckload cost in 2004 we qualify each motor carrier to make sure it is properly licensed and insured and that it has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages to fulfill regulatory requirements our motor carrier contracts commit to a series of three shipments and an initial transportation rate our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual load with a carrier as of december 31 2004 we also had intermodal marketing contracts with several railroads including all of the major north american railroads giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis because we don’t own any transportation equipment or employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers freight these relationships are critical to our success and we are reliant on them to provide us with information regarding the status of shipments during transit and upon delivery delays in these communications could cause us to record transactions late because we recognize revenue when we know our services are completed we have developed systems and controls to make these status updates as efficient and timely as possible for us and the carrier 

  

competition 

  

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of other nonasset based logistics companies assetbased logistics companies third party freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ own transportation departments we also buy and sell transportation services from and to companies with which we compete 

  

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

communications and information systems 

  

our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate service our customers and carriers and manage our business our proprietary information systems help our employees efficiently manage more than 38 million shipments annually and 35000 carrier relationships our employees are linked with each other and with our customers and our carriers by telephone fax internet email andor edi to communicate load requirements and availability and to confirm and bill orders through our internet sites chrwonlinecom and chrwtruckscom customers and carriers can contract loads or equipment and track and trace shipments including delivery confirmation customers and carriers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the internet 

  

our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities communicate and coordinate activity with other branches and “crosscover” or find equipment for other branches’ freight our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate loads and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems also make load data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers enabling our salespeople to select carriers and track loads in progress our systems automatically provide visible alerts to any arising problems our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers these reports provide them with information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and support analysis of their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute costs 

  

government regulation 

  

the transportation industry has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes that have affected the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and cost of providing transportation services for example in 2004 the us department of transportation federal motor carrier safety administration issued new hours of service regulations that affect many of our suppliers we do not believe that these new regulations have had a material impact on our business and we cannot predict the effect if any that future legislative and regulatory changes may have on the transportation industry 

  

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements under certain circumstances one of our subsidiary companies provides limited motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the dot including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and we maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond we operate as an indirect air cargo carrier subject to economic regulation by the dot and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection 

  

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations have recently become subject to federal and state money transfer regulations as a result of the law changes under the usa patriot act of 2001 

  

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some loads for which we arrange transportation may be subject to licensing 

  

registration or permit requirements we generally rely on the carrier transporting the load to ensure compliance with these types of requirements we along with the carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability 

  

risk management and insurance 

  

we generally assume full value cargo risk for our customers in our truck and intermodal operations unless stipulated contractually otherwise we subrogate our losses against the motor or rail carrier with the transportation responsibilities we require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in general liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance many carriers carry insurance limits exceeding these minimums railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

  

we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

  

we maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier we also carry various liability insurance policies including auto and general liability with a 100 million umbrella our contingent auto liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident 

  

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover this type of risk in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product which is generally not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our the fresh 1 ® brand loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

  

cautionary statement relevant to forwardlooking information 

  

this annual report on form 10k and our financial statements “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this report and other documents incorporated by reference contain certain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these forwardlooking statements represent our expectations beliefs intentions or strategies concerning future events including but not limited to any statements regarding our current assumptions about future financial performance the continuation of historical trends the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating activities for future liquidity and capital resource needs the effects benefits or other aspects of current or future acquisitions or dispositions the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows the results timing outcome or effect of litigation and our intentions or expectations of prevailing with respect thereto anticipated problems and our plans for future operations and the economy in general or the future of the third party logistics industry all of which are subject to various risks and uncertainties 

  

when used in this form 10k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission in our press releases presentations to securities analysts or investors in oral statements made by or with the approval of any of our executive officers the words or phrases “believes” “may” “could” “will” “expects” “should” “continue” “anticipates” “intends” “will likely result” “estimates” “projects” or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements however any statements contained in this form 10k that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements 

  

we caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties certain of which are beyond our control and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors including but not limited to such factors as market demand and pressures on the pricing for our services changing market conditions competition and growth rates within the third party logistics industry availability of truck capacity or alternative means of transporting freight and changes in 

  

relationships with existing truck rail ocean and air carriers changes in our customer base due to possible consolidation among our customers our ability to integrate the operations of acquired companies with our historic operations successfully changes in accounting policies risks associated with litigation and insurance coverage risks associated with operations outside of the us changing economic conditions such as general economic slowdown decreased consumer confidence fuel shortages and the impact of war on the economy and other risks and uncertainties including those described below 

  

you should consider carefully the following cautionary statements if you own our common stock or are planning to buy our common stock we intend to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the “pslra” by providing this discussion we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results except to the extent required by law 

  

risk factors 

  

demand for our services may decrease during an economic recession  the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical financial results as a result of economic recession the business cycles of our customers fuel shortages price hikes by carriers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control carriers can be expected to charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses and our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of higher transportation costs if economic recession or a downturn in our customers’ business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage or printing industries our operating results could also be adversely affected 

  

we depend upon others to provide equipment and services we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers freight and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight we are dependent on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims this reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently many of these risks are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

our international business raises additional difficulties we provide services within and between continents on an increasing basis our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 

  

as we expand our business in foreign countries we will expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles we have no control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 

  

our ability to hire additional people is important to the continued growth of our business our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespersons and other logistics professionals our 

  

growth may be limited if we cannot recruit and retain a sufficient number of people we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors our rapid expansion of operations has placed added demands on our management continued expansion depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers 

  

we are reliant on technology to operate our business we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers we are reliant on our technology staff to successfully implement changes to our operating systems in an efficient manner computer viruses could cause an interruption to the availability of our systems unauthorized access to our systems with malicious intent could result in the theft of proprietary information and in systems outages an unplanned systems outage or unauthorized access to our systems could materially and adversely affect our business 

  

because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of branch offices throughout north america south america europe and asia supported by executives and services in a central corporate office with branch management retaining responsibility for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions and the growth of the business in their branch our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations in addition certain of our branches operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective branch without significant central oversight and coordination our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation 

  

we face substantial industry competition competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad based we compete against other nonasset based logistics companies as well as logistics companies that own their own equipment third party freight brokers internet matching services and internet freight brokers and carriers offering logistics services we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ transportation departments we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors historically competition has created downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our gross profit and income from operations 

  

our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season in recent years our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot assure you that it will not adversely impact us in the future 

  

we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations we use the services of thousands of transportation companies and their drivers in connection with our transportation operations from time to time these drivers are involved in accidents and the carrier may not have adequate insurance coverage although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owner operators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them claims against us may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all in addition our auto liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers’ compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results in addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability 

  

our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce  the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by government food safety regulation growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently 

  

sourcing and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability  agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we sell produce we may have legal responsibility arising from the sale while we are insured for up to 100 million for product liability claims settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot assure you that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available if we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product which our insurance does not cover any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our 

  

reputation particularly of our produce brand the fresh 1 ® or of our other licensed branded products loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business 

  

our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations we are licensed by the us department of transportation as a broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle we must comply with certain insurance and surety bond requirements to act in this capacity we are also licensed by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder which requires us to maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond we are also licensed by the bureau of us customs and border protection we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

  

legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services as part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal and state environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations we may experience an increase in operating costs such as costs for security as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 

  

we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 

  

we derive a significant portion of our gross revenues and gross profit from our largest clients the sudden loss many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

  

we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot assure you that we will be able to make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all if we acquire a company we may have difficulty integrating its businesses products services technologies and personnel into our operations acquired companies or operations may have unexpected liabilities and we may face challenges in retaining significant customers of acquired companies these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and workforce increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders 

  

our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price  historically our longterm growth objective has been 15 for both gross profits operating income and earnings per share there can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth we can provide no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic or political conditions slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price

sourcing the buying selling and brokering of fresh produce was our original business when we were founded in 1905 much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers our customers include produce wholesalers large grocery retailers restaurants and foodservice distributors in the majority of cases we also arrange the transport of the fresh produce we sell through our relationships with owners of specialized transportation equipment in response to demand and changing market conditions we have developed our own brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  and have entered into licensing agreements for national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through various relationships and packed to order through contract packing agreements we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures as part of our national brand programs 

  

information services our third business line is comprised of a ch robinson subsidiary tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are motor carriers for which it provides a variety of management and information services such as funds transfer driver payroll services fuel management services and fuel and use tax reporting for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller transfers funds to the truck stop and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

  

our business model has been the main driver of our strong historical results and has positioned us for continued growth our principal competitive advantage is our large decentralized branch network of 158 offices staffed by approximately 3000 salespeople these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and carriers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers’ and carriers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations a significant portion of our branch employees’ compensation is performanceoriented based on the profitability of their branch and their contributions to the success of the branch we believe this makes our sales employees more serviceoriented focused and creative 

  

we have grown over the years both internally by expanding or opening new branch offices and by selective acquisitions when circumstances warranted in october 2003 we acquired the ongoing operations assets and certain liabilities of frank m viet gmbh internationale spedition “viet” viet is an international freight forwarding and third party logistics company based in hamburg germany viet had annual gross revenues of approximately 56 million in 2002 in february 2004 we acquired camway transportation corporation “camway” a third party logistics company based in toledo ohio that provides domestic truckload and intermodal transportation brokerage services camway had annual gross revenues of approximately 170 million in 2003 

  

multimodal transportation services 

  

ch robinson is a third party logistics company we provide freight transportation and logistics services we are a nonasset based provider meaning we do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight we make a profit or margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation provider also known as a “carrier” to transport the freight 

  

we can arrange all of the following modes of transportation on a worldwide basis 

  

   

   

   

   

   

on a daytoday basis customers communicate their freight needs typically on a loadbyload basis to the branch office salesperson responsible for their account they communicate with us by means of telephone fax internet email or edi electronic data interchange the branch employee enters all appropriate information about each load into our operating system with the help of information provided by the operating system the salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the load and selects a carrier or carriers based upon their knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors based on the information he or she has about the market and rates the salesperson may either determine an appropriate price at that point or wait to communicate with a carrier directly before setting a price once the carrier is selected the salesperson communicates with the carrier’s dispatch office to agree on the price for the transportation and the carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation at this point the salesperson provides the carrier information to the customer our branch employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer 

  

we are a principal in the transaction by accepting the customer’s order we become responsible for transportation of the load from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges also we usually are responsible to our customer for any claims for damage to freight while in transit or performance in most cases we receive reimbursement from the carrier for these claims 

  

as a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle a specified number of loads usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center our commitment to handle the loads is usually at specific rates but subject to seasonal variation most of our rate commitments are for one year or less to meet our obligations under these customer contracts we may get advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport the contracted loads for the length of our customer contract but most of our truckload freight is priced to our carriers on a spot market or transactional basis 

  

in the course of providing daytoday transportation services our branch employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies we will analyze the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we can evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers we can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings we will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims we can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations we may also examine the customer’s warehousing and dock procedures many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically priced separately they are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship in addition to these transportation services we may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting and other services for which we are usually paid separately 

  

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become business partners with our customers responsible for a greater portion of their supply chain management we may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several branches our multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network see our “notes to consolidated financial statements” included as part of our audited consolidated financial statements for an allocation of our gross revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2003 and 2002 in the united states and in foreign locations 

  

the table below shows our gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

  

transportation gross profits 

in thousands 

  

     

transportation services accounted for approximately 85 of our gross profits in each of 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

sourcing 

  

throughout our 99year history we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be quickly packaged transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment and distributed quickly to replenish high turnover inventories maintained by wholesalers foodservice companies restaurants and retailers in most instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations 

  

during the past eight years we have actively sought to expand our sourcing customer base by focusing on large multistore grocery retailers traditionally grocery retailers have relied mainly on regional or even local purchases from food wholesalers for produce sourcing and storelevel distribution as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation these methods have become inefficient our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers’ produce purchasing and provide uniform quality from region to region and store to store our sourcing services have expanded to include justintime replenishment commodity management and business analysis in response to demand and changing market conditions we introduced our proprietary brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  which includes a wide range of fruits and vegetables that are uniform in quality and top grade since 1998 we have entered into new branded produce programs including licensing agreements for major national brands these brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with some of our retail customers we have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our national brand programs 

  

sourcing accounted for approximately 10 of our gross profits in each of 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

information services 

  

information services is comprised of a subsidiary of ch robinson tchek systems inc tchek’s customers are motor carriers and truck stop chains tchek provides its motor carrier customers with funds transfer and driver payroll services fuel management services fuel and use tax reporting and online access to customtailored information management reports all through the use of its proprietary automated systems these systems enable motor carriers to track equipment manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

  

information services accounted for approximately 5 of our gross profits in each of 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

organization 

  

to keep us close to our customers and markets we have created and continue to expand a network of 158 offices which we call “branches” our branches are supported by executives and other centralized shared services approximately 14 of our employees are corporate employees who provide these centralized shared services 

  

branch network 

  

each branch office is responsible for its own growth and profitability our branch salespeople are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespeople are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are usually contracted and priced at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to hire carriers to transport loads branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international and air shipments multiple branches may also work together to service larger national accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one branch are required to meet the customer’s needs their efforts are usually coordinated by one “lead” branch on the account 

  

salespeople in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our database referrals from current customers leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets and third party sources such as industry directories salespeople are also responsible for recruiting new carriers who are qualified by our carrier services group to make sure they are properly licensed and insured and have the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis 

  

branch expansion we expect to continue to open new branch offices new branch offices are viewed as a longterm contributor to overall company growth in addition to market opportunity a major consideration in opening a new branch is whether we have branch salespeople that are ready to manage a new branch additional branches are often opened within a territory previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch a modest amount of capital is required to open a new branch usually involving a lease for a small amount of office space communications and hardware and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time 

  

branch employees because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our hiring we recruit applicants from across north america south america europe and asia our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry 

  

newly hired branch employees go through onthejob training at the branch level which ranges from six months to a year and emphasizes development of the necessary skills and customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team we expect most new salespeople to start contributing to the success of the branch in a matter of weeks after approximately a year of experience each salesperson attends our national training meeting to get additional training and have the opportunity to develop relationships with employees of other branches 

  

employees at the branch level form a team the team structure is motivated by our incentive compensation system in which a significant portion of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespeople is dependent on the profitability of their particular branch or business unit for any calendar year branch managers and salespeople who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year based on a system of “points” awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contributions employees can also receive profit sharing contributions 

  

that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our profit sharing plan in some special circumstances such as opening new branches we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time 

  

all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan to promote longterm share ownership in 2003 656 employees were awarded a total of 866025 restricted stock units or shares employees at all levels after a qualifying period of employment are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan 

  

individual salespeople benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals they are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including branch management national sales and national account management we have a “promote from within” philosophy and fill nearly all branch management positions with current employees 

  

executive officers 

  

under our decentralized business structure branch managers report directly to and receive guidance and support from a small group of executive officers at our central corporate office customers carriers managers and employees have direct access to our chief executive officer john wiehoff and all other executive officers these executives provide training and education develop new services and applications to be offered to customers share operations and management guidance and provide broad market analysis

employees 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had a total of 4112 employees of whom 3551 were located in our branch offices corporate services such as accounting information systems legal marketing communications human resources credit support and claims support are provided centrally we believe that our compensation and benefit plans are among the most competitive in the industry and that our relationship with our employees is good 

  

customers and marketing 

  

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services during 2003 we served over 16000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2003 no customer accounted for more than 8 of gross revenues or 5 of gross profits in recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes and providing more services to our existing customers 

  

we believe that our decentralized structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers with the guidance of experienced branch managers who have an average tenure of 12 years with us branches are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers 

  

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that we can provide we have also expanded our national sales and marketing support to enhance branch sales capabilities increasingly branches call on our executives our national sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements 

  

relationships with carriers 

  

we continually work on establishing relationships with good carriers to assure dependable services favorable pricing and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply to strengthen and maintain our relationships with carriers our salespeople regularly communicate with carriers serving their region and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment to make it easier for carriers to work with us we have a policy of prompt payment 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had contracts with approximately 30000 motor carriers these motor carriers provide access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds these carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one carrier our largest truckload carrier was less than 1 of our total purchased truckload cost in 2003 we qualify each motor carrier to make sure it is properly licensed and insured and that it has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages to fulfill regulatory requirements our motor carrier contracts commit to a series of three shipments and an initial transportation rate our contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual load with a carrier as of december 31 2003 we also had intermodal marketing contracts with several railroads including all of the major north american railroads giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis 

  

competition 

  

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of other nonasset based logistics companies assetbased logistics companies third party freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ own transportation departments we also buy and sell transportation services from and to companies with which we compete 

  

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

  

   

   

   

   

communications and information systems 

  

our information systems are essential to our ability to efficiently communicate service our customers and carriers and manage our business our proprietary information systems help our employees efficiently manage more than 3 million shipments annually and 30000 carrier relationships our employees are linked with each other and with our customers and our carriers by telephone fax internet email andor edi to communicate load requirements and availability and to confirm and bill orders through our internet sites chrwonline and chrwtruckscom customers and carriers can contract loads or equipment and track and trace shipments customers and carriers also have access to other information in our operating systems through the internet 

  

our branch employees use our information systems to identify freight matching opportunities communicate and coordinate activity with other branches and “crosscover” or find equipment for other branches’ freight our systems help our salespeople service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate loads and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters our systems also make load data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers enabling our salespeople to select carriers and track loads in progress our systems automatically provide visible alerts to any arising problems our systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports that are available to our customers these reports provide them with information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and support analysis of their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute costs 

  

government regulation 

  

the transportation industry has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes that have affected the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and cost of providing transportation services for example in 2004 the us department of transportation federal motor carrier safety administration issued new hours of service regulations that affect many of our suppliers we do not believe that these new regulations will have a material impact on our business and we cannot predict the effect if any that future legislative and regulatory changes may have on the transportation industry 

  

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation broker and are licensed by the us department of transportation “dot” to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements under certain circumstances one of our subsidiary companies provides limited motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the dot including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and we maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond we operate as an indirect air cargo carrier subject to economic regulation by the dot and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of us customs and border protection 

  

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the us department of agriculture other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations have recently become subject to federal and state money transfer regulations as a result of the law changes under the usa patriot act of 2001 

  

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight we continue to be subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements we along with the carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject 

  

to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines or in the event of serious violation suspension or revocation of operating authority as well as increased claims liability 

  

risk management and insurance 

  

we generally assume full value cargo risk for our customers in our truck and intermodal operations unless stipulated contractually otherwise we subrogate our losses against the motor or rail carrier with the transportation responsibilities we require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in general liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance many carriers carry insurance limits exceeding these minimums railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment 

  

we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

  

we maintain a broad cargo liability policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier we also carry various liability policies including auto and general liability with a 100 million umbrella 

  

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination can lead to product recalls and tort claims may be brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce as a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover this type of risk in addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product which is generally not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our the fresh 1 ® brand loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

overview 

  

founded in 1905 ch robinson worldwide inc “the company” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the largest thirdparty logistics companies in north america with 2002 gross revenues of 33 billion we are a global provider of multimodal transportation services and logistics solutions operating through a network of 150 offices in north america south america europe and asia through contracts with approximately 20000 motor carriers we maintain the single largest network of motor carrier capacity in north america and are one of the largest thirdparty providers of intermodal services in the united states in addition we regularly provide air ocean and customs services as an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as fresh produce sourcing freight consolidation and information reporting during 2002 we handled approximately 27 million shipments for more than 15000 customers ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries 

  

we have developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide as a result we have the capability of managing all aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers as a nonasset based transportation provider we focus on seeking solutions that work for our customers rather than on asset utilization using established relationships with motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers 

  

throughout our 98year history we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities due to the timesensitive nature and quality requirements of the shipments fresh produce represents a unique logistics challenge and the distribution and transportation costs are significant we have developed a network of produce sources and maintain access to specialized equipment and transportation modes designed to ensure timely delivery of uniform quality produce in response to demand from large grocery retailers and food service distributors we have developed our own brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  and entered into licensing agreements for national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through various relationships and packed to order through contract packing agreements 

  

our business philosophy has accounted for our strong historical results and has positioned us for continued growth our principal competitive advantage is our large decentralized branch network staffed by approximately 2700 salespersons these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and carriers which facilitates quick responses to customers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in both marketing our services and providing these services to individual customers we compensate our branch employees principally on the basis of individual performance and their branch’s profitability which in our opinion produces a more serviceoriented focused and creative sales force we believe our employees continue to hold substantial amounts of our common stock 

  

we were reincorporated in delaware in 1997 as the successor to a business existing in various legal forms since 1905 our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market under the symbol “chrw” on october 15 1997 certain stockholders sold 24330310 shares of our common stock to the public pursuant to a registered public offering the proceeds of which were paid entirely to the selling stockholders prior to such date there was no established public trading market for our common stock 

  

in october 2000 our board of directors declared a twoforone stock split effected in the form of a 100 stock dividend paid on december 1 2000 to stockholders of record on november 10 2000 this was our first stock split since our initial public offering 

  

in january 2002 we acquired the ongoing operations and certain assets of smith terminal transportation services inc which did business as fts a privately held nonasset based thirdparty provider of transportation and logistics services located in miami florida fts had annual gross revenues of approximately 27 million in 2001 

  

  

our corporate office is located at 8100 mitchell road eden prairie minnesota 553442248 and our telephone number is 952 9378500 copies of our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 are available free of charge through our website wwwchrobinsoncom as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission 

  

logistics services 

  

as a global thirdparty logistics company we provide multimodal transportation and related logistics services sourcing and feebased information services 

  

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers in order to provide logistics solutions that reduce or eliminate inefficiencies in customers’ supply chains whenever appropriate we analyze the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection we may also examine the customer’s warehousing picking procedures loading unloading and dock scheduling procedures as well as packaging and pallet configuration procedures we then evaluate how these procedures interact with shipping manufacturing and customer service upon completion of an initial analysis we propose solutions that allow the customer to streamline operating procedures and contain costs while improving the management of its supply chain our branch employees remain involved with the customer throughout the analysis and implementation of the proposed solution in the course of providing daytoday transportation services branch employees offer further logistics analysis and solutions as the employees become more familiar with the customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain our ultimate goal is to assist the customer in managing its entire supply chain while being the customer’s key provider of individual transportation services 

  

multimodal transportation services 

  

on a daytoday basis customers communicate their freight needs typically on a loadbyload basis to us by means of a telephone call fax transmission internet email or edi message to the branch office salesperson responsible for the particular customer all appropriate information about each load is entered into our operating system with the help of information provided by the operating system a salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the load and selects a carrier or carriers based upon the salesperson’s knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors a salesperson then communicates with the carrier’s dispatch office to confirm a price for the transportation and the carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation at this point the salesperson provides the carrier information to the customer together with our sales price which is intended to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer by accepting the customer’s order we become legally responsible for transportation of the load from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges we are also responsible to our customer for any claims for damage to freight while in transit or performance in most cases we receive reimbursement from the carrier for these claims 

  

as a result of our logistics capabilities many customers look to us to handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center in a number of instances we have contracts with the customer whereby we agree to handle a specified number of loads usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center at specific rates but subject to seasonal variation most of our rate commitments are for periods of one year or less to meet our obligations under these customer contracts we may obtain advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport the contracted loads for the length of our customer contract 

  

as part of our customer focus we offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis to assure timely efficient and cost effective delivery through the use of one or more transportation modes these logistics services include transportation management price and modal comparisons and selection shipment consolidation and optimization improvement of operating and shipping procedures and claims management minimization of storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations logistics network and location analysis to optimize the entire supply chain tracking and tracing reverse logistics and other special needs management information and analysis of a customer’s risk and claims management practices we will evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers many of these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically separately priced 

  

but instead are reflected as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us on a transactional basis pursuant to continuing customer relationships in addition to these transportation services we may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting and other services for which we are separately compensated 

  

we are capable of arranging all modes of transportation services on a worldwide basis 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the table below shows our gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

  

transportation gross profits 

in thousands 

  

    

   

transportation accounted for approximately 85 of our gross profits in each of 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

as we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have become broader and we have become business partners with our customers responsible for a greater portion of their supply chain management customers may be served by specially created teams and through several branches our 

  

multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide branch network the “notes to consolidated financial statements” present the allocation of our gross revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 and our longlived assets as of december 31 2002 and 2001 in the united states and in foreign locations 

  

sourcing 

  

throughout our 98year history we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be quickly packaged transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment and distributed quickly to replenish high turnover inventories maintained by wholesalers food service companies and retailers in most instances we consolidate individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations our sourcing business is with produce wholesalers who purchase produce in relatively large quantities through us and resell the produce to grocery retailers restaurants and other resellers of food food service companies and with retail grocery store chains and other multistore retailers 

  

during the past seven years we have actively sought to expand our food sourcing customer base by focusing on the large multistore retailers as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation their traditional methods of produce sourcing and storelevel distribution which relied principally on regional or even local purchases from wholesalers have become inefficient our logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can improve the retailers’ produce purchasing as well as assure uniform quality from region to region and store to store we provide justintime replenishment services to retailers we introduced our proprietary the fresh 1 ® brand of produce in 1989 which includes a wide range of uniform quality top grade fruits and vegetables purchased from various domestic and international growers since 1998 we have entered into new sourcing programs including licensing agreements for major national brands that have expanded our market presence and sourcing capabilities with respect to both product lines and nationally recognized brand names 

  

sourcing accounted for approximately 10 of our gross profits in each of 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

information services 

  

a subsidiary of ch robinson tchek systems inc provides motor carrier customers with funds transfer and driver payroll services fuel management services fuel and use tax reporting and online access to customtailored information management reports all through the use of its proprietary automated system this system enables motor carriers to track equipment manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data provides management information to the seller and invoices the carrier for fuel cash advances and our fee 

  

information services accounted for approximately 5 of our gross profits in each of 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

organization 

  

to allow us to stay close to customers and markets we have created and continue to expand a network of 150 offices supported by executives and services in a central corporate office 

  

branch network 

  

branch salespersons are responsible for developing new business receiving and processing orders from specific customers and customers located in the area served by the branch and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespersons are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are almost always contracted at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to cover loads some branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international and air shipments 

  

salespersons in the branches both sell to and service their customers sales opportunities are identified through our database industry directories referrals by existing customers and leads generated by branch office 

  

personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets each branch is also responsible for locating and contracting with carriers 

  

as of december 31 2002 our branch salespersons represented 695 of our total work force and all branch employees including support staff represented 858 of our work force at december 31 2002 the number of salespersons per branch ranged from two to approximately 360 

  

branch expansion we expect to continue to add branch offices as management determines that a new branch may contribute to continued growth and as branch salespersons develop the capability to manage a new branch additional branches are often opened within a territory previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch capital required to open a new branch is modest involving a lease for a small amount of office space communication links and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time 

  

branch employees for almost two decades new branch salespersons have been hired through a profiling system using standardized tests to measure an applicant against the traits determined by us to be those of our successful employees these common traits facilitate cooperative efforts necessary for the success of each office applicants are recruited from across north america south america europe and asia typically have college degrees and some have business experience not necessarily within the transportation industry we are highly selective in determining to whom we offer employment 

  

newly hired branch employees receive onthejob training at the branch level which ranges from six months to a year and emphasizes development of the necessary skills and customer service philosophy to become productive members of a branch team we believe most salespersons become productive employees in a matter of weeks after gaining approximately a year of experience each salesperson attends our national training session to receive additional training and foster relationships between branches 

  

employees at the branch level form a team which is enhanced by our incentive compensation system under this system part of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespersons is dependent on the profitability of the particular branch or business unit for any calendar year branch managers and salespersons who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year based on a system of “points” awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contribution for 2002 incentivebased cash compensation averaged approximately 30 of branch salespersons’ total cash compensation 71 of branch managers’ total cash compensation and 64 of officers’ total cash compensation branch employees can earn significant individual incentive compensation based on achieving individual and branch growth goals and contributions that depend on our overall profitability and other factors in our profit sharing plan in connection with establishing new branches and other special circumstances we may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons for a short period of time 

  

all of our managers and other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in our amended 1997 omnibus stock plan employees at all levels after a qualifying period of employment are eligible to participate in the our employee stock purchase plan 

  

individual salespersons benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals and are motivated by the opportunity to become branch managers assistant managers or department managers all branch salespersons are full time employees 

  

executive officers 

  

under our decentralized business structure branch managers report directly to and receive guidance and support from a small group of executive officers at our central corporate office customers carriers managers and employees have direct access to our chief executive officer john wiehoff and all other executive officers these executives provide training and education concerning logistics develop new services and applications to be offered to customers and provide broad market analysis

customers and marketing 

  

we seek to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing the customer with a full range of logistics services we serve over 15000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2002 no customer accounted for more than 8 of gross revenues or 4 of gross profits in recent years 

  

revenue growth has been achieved through the growth and consolidation of customers expansion of the services provided by us and an increase in the number of customers served 

  

we believe that decentralization allows salespersons to better serve our customers by developing a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers with the guidance of experienced branch managers who have an average tenure of 11 years with us branches are given significant latitude in pursuing opportunities and committing our resources to serve customers 

  

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that we are capable of providing we have begun placing increased emphasis on national sales and marketing support to enhance branch capabilities increasingly branches call on executives a national sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements 

  

relationships with carriers 

  

we seek to establish longterm relationships with carriers in order to assure dependable services favorable pricing and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods of undercapacity to strengthen and maintain these relationships our salespersons regularly communicate with carriers serving their region and seek to assist carriers with equipment utilization reduction of empty miles and equipment repositioning we have a policy of prompt payment and provide centralized claims management on behalf of various shippers many smaller carriers effectively consider us as their sales and marketing department 

  

as of december 31 2002 we had contracts with approximately 25000 motor carriers providing access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds those carriers include owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently we are not dependent on any one carrier our largest truckload carrier was less than 1 of our total purchased truckload cost in 2002 we qualify each motor carrier to assure that it is properly licensed and insured and has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis our motor carrier contracts require that the carrier commit to a minimum number of shipments issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us and permit us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages carrier contracts also establish transportation rates that can be modified by issuance of an individual load confirmation as of december 31 2002 we also had intermodal marketing contracts with railroads including all of the major north american railroads giving us access to additional trailers and containers our contracts with railroads govern the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis 

  

competition 

  

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented we compete against a large number of other nonasset based logistics companies assetbased logistics companies thirdparty freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders we also compete against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ own transportation departments we also buy and sell transportation services from and to companies with which we compete 

  

we often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are 

  

   

   

   

   

  

  

communications and information systems 

  

to handle the large number of daily transactions and to accommodate our decentralized branch system we have designed an extensive communications and information system employees are linked with each other and with customers and carriers by telephone facsimile internet email andor edi to communicate requirements and availability to confirm and bill orders and through our internet sites chrwonline and chrwtruckscom to contract loads or equipment and track and trace shipments customers and carriers also have access to our systems through the internet we have developed our own proprietary operating systems that help salespersons service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate loads and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters systems also make load data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers enabling the salespersons to select carriers and track loads in progress and automatically provide visible alerts to any arising problems our proprietary operating systems use data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports which are available to our logistics customers to provide information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and enable customers to analyze their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute and outofstock costs 

  

government regulation 

  

the transportation industry has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes that have affected the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and cost of providing transportation services we cannot predict the effect if any that future legislative and regulatory changes may have on the transportation industry 

  

we are subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation provider and are licensed by the department of transportation “dot” as a broker in arranging for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements we provide motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the dot including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts we are subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and maintain a nonvessel operating common carrier bond we operate as an indirect air cargo carrier subject to economic regulation by the dot and provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the united states customs service of the department of treasury 

  

we source fresh produce under a license issued by the united states department of agriculture other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations our tchek operations have recently become subject to federal and state money transfer regulations as a result of the law changes under the usa patriot act of 2001 

  

although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight we continue to be subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements we along with the carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines or in the event of serious violation suspension or revocation of operating authority as well as increased claims liability 

  

risk management and insurance 

  

we generally assume full value cargo risk to our customers in our truck and intermodal operations unless stipulated contractually otherwise we subrogate our losses against the motor or rail carrier with the transportation responsibilities we require all motor carriers participating in our contract program to carry at least 750000 in general liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance many carriers carry insurance limits exceeding these minimums railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment for both truck and rail transportation higher coverage is available to the customer on a loadbyload basis at an additional price 

  

  

we do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses we offer our customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehouseman’s coverage to our customers and contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage 

  

we maintain a broad cargo liability policy to protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier we also carry various liability policies including auto and general liability with a 100 million umbrella 

  

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination has led to recalls of products and tort claims have been brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because we are a seller of produce we may have legal responsibility arising from sales of produce while we carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot assure that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available in addition in connection with any recall we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product for which we are not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our the fresh 1 ® brand loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

 item 1 business 

  

overview

robinson has developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide as a result the company has the capability of managing all aspects of the supply chain on behalf of its customers as a nonasset based transportation provider robinson can focus on optimizing the transportation solution for its customer rather than on its own asset utilization using established relationships with motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight and ocean carriers 

  

throughout its 96year history the company has been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of robinson’s logistics expertise can be traced to its significant experience in handling perishable commodities due to the timesensitive nature and quality requirements of the shipments fresh produce represents a unique logistics challenge and the distribution and transportation costs are significant robinson has developed a network of produce sources and maintains access to specialized equipment and transportation modes designed to ensure timely delivery of uniform quality produce in response to demand from large grocery retailers and food service distributors the company has developed its own brand of produce the fresh 1 ®  and entered into licensing agreements for national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through various relationships and packed to order through contract packing agreements 

  

robinson’s business philosophy has accounted for its strong historical results and has positioned the company for continued growth the company’s principal competitive advantage is its large decentralized branch network staffed by approximately 2670 salespersons who are in close proximity to both customers and carriers this facilitates quick responses to customers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in both marketing robinson’s services and providing these services to individual customers robinson compensates its branch employees principally on the basis of individual performance and their branch’s profitability which in the company’s opinion produces a more serviceoriented focused and creative sales force the company believes its employees continue to hold substantial amounts of the company’s common stock 

  

the company was reincorporated in delaware in 1997 as the successor to a business existing in various legal forms since 1905 robinson’s common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market under the symbol “chrw” on october 15 1997 certain stockholders of the company sold 24330310 shares of the company’s common stock to the public pursuant to a registered public offering the proceeds of which were paid entirely to the selling stockholders prior to such date there was no established public trading market for the company’s common stock 

  

in october 2000 the company’s board of directors declared a twoforone stock split effected in the form of a 100 stock dividend paid on december 1 2000 to stockholders of record on november 10 2000 this was the first robinson stock split since the company’s initial public offering 

  

in january 2002 the company acquired the ongoing operations and certain assets of smith terminal transportation services inc which does business as fts a privately held nonasset based thirdparty provider of transportation and logistics services located in miami florida fts had annual gross revenues of approximately 27 million in 2001

logistics services 

  

as a global thirdparty logistics company robinson provides multimodal transportation and related logistics services sourcing and feebased information services 

  

the company seeks to establish longterm relationships with its customers in order to provide logistics solutions that reduce or eliminate inefficiencies in customers’ supply chains whenever appropriate robinson analyzes the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection robinson may also examine the customer’s warehousing picking procedures loading unloading and dock scheduling procedures as well as packaging and pallet configuration procedures the company then evaluates how these procedures interact with shipping manufacturing and customer service upon completion of an initial analysis robinson proposes solutions that allow the customer to streamline operating procedures and contain costs while improving the management of its supply chain robinson branch employees remain involved with the customer throughout the analysis and implementation of the proposed solution in the course of providing daytoday transportation services branch employees offer further logistics analysis and solutions as the employees become more familiar with the customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain the company’s ultimate goal is to assist the customer in managing its entire supply chain while being the customer’s key provider of individual transportation services 

  

multimodal transportation services 

  

on a daytoday basis customers communicate their freight needs typically on a loadbyload basis to robinson by means of a telephone call fax transmission internet email or edi message to the branch office salesperson responsible for the particular customer all appropriate information about each load is entered into the company’s computer based operating system with the help of the operating system a salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the load and selects a carrier or carriers based upon the salesperson’s knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors a salesperson then communicates with the carrier’s dispatch office to confirm a price for the transportation and the carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation at this point the salesperson provides the carrier information to the customer together with the company’s sales price which is intended to provide a profit to robinson for the totality of services performed for the customer by accepting the customer’s order robinson becomes legally responsible for transportation of the load from origin to destination the carrier’s contract is with robinson not the customer and robinson is responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges robinson is also responsible to its customer for any claims for damage to freight while in transit or performance in most cases robinson receives reimbursement from the carrier for these claims 

  

as a result of its logistics capabilities many customers now look to robinson to handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center in a number of instances robinson has contracts with the customer whereby robinson agrees to handle a specified number of loads usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center at specific rates but subject to seasonal variation most of the company’s rate commitments are for periods of one year or less 

  

as part of its customer focus robinson offers a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis to assure timely efficient and cost effective delivery through the use of one or more transportation modes these logistics services include transportation management price and modal comparisons and selection shipment consolidation and optimization improvement of operating and shipping procedures and claims management minimization of storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations logistics network and nodal location analysis to optimize the entire supply chain tracking and tracing reverse logistics and other special needs management information and analysis of a customer’s risk and claims management practices robinson will evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by reviewing such factors as carriers’ insurance certificates safety ratings and financial stability as well as establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically 

  

separately priced but instead are reflected as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by the company on a transactional basis pursuant to continuing customer relationships in addition to these transportation services robinson may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting and other services for which it is separately compensated 

  

the company is capable of arranging several modes of transportation services on a worldwide basis 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

the table below shows the company’s gross profits by transportation mode for the periods indicated 

  

transportation gross profits 

in thousands 

 

 

  

 

  

transportation accounted for approximately 79 85 and 86 of the company’s gross profits in 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively 

  

as robinson has emphasized integrated logistics solutions its relationships with many customers have become broader with the company becoming a business partner responsible for a greater portion of supply chain management customers may be served by specially created robinson teams and through several branches robinson’s multimodal transportation services are provided to numerous international customers through its domestic branch offices as well as through branch offices in canada mexico belgium england france germany italy poland spain argentina brazil chile and venezuela the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements present robinson’s gross revenues from international customers for the years ended december 31 1999 2000 and 2001 and the company’s longlived assets as of december 31 2000 and 2001 in the united states and in foreign locations 

  

sourcing 

  

throughout its 96year history robinson has been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of the company’s logistics expertise can be traced to robinson’s significant experience in handling perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be quickly packaged transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment and distributed quickly to replenish high turnover inventories maintained by wholesalers food service companies and retailers in most instances robinson consolidates individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arranges for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations the company’s sourcing business is with produce wholesalers who purchase produce in relatively large quantities through robinson and resell the produce to grocery retailers restaurants and other resellers of food food service companies and with grocery store chains and other multistore retailers 

  

during the past six years the company has actively sought to expand its food sourcing customer base by focusing on the larger multistore retailers as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation their traditional methods of produce sourcing and storelevel distribution which relied principally on regional or even local purchases from wholesalers have become inefficient robinson’s logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can greatly improve the retailers’ produce purchasing as well as assure uniform quality from region to region and store to store the company provides justintime replenishment services to retailers the company introduced its proprietary the fresh 1 ® brand of produce in 1989 which includes a wide range of uniform quality top grade fruits and vegetables purchased from various domestic and international growers since 1998 robinson has entered into new sourcing programs including licensing agreements for major national brands that have expanded the company’s market presence and sourcing capabilities with respect to both product lines and nationally recognized brand names 

  

sourcing accounted for approximately 15 10 and 10 of the company’s gross profits in 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively 

  

information services 

  

a subsidiary of the company tchek systems inc provides motor carrier customers with funds transfer and driver payroll services fuel management services fuel and use tax reporting as well as online access to customtailored information management reports all through the use of its proprietary automated system this system enables motor carriers to track equipment manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data applies the margin agreed between seller and purchaser reprices the sale invoices the carrier and provides management information to the seller 

  

through the first half of 2001 a robinson subsidiary payment  logistics services inc provided freight payment services to shippers robinson closed this business on june 30 2001 

  

the company’s carrier information services accounted for approximately 6 5 and 5 of the company’s gross profits in 1999 2000 and 2001 respectively 

  

organization 

  

to allow the company to stay close to customers and markets robinson has created and continues to expand a network of 139 offices supported by executives and services in a central office 

  

branch network 

  

branch salespersons are responsible for developing new business receiving and processing orders from specific customers and customers located in the area served by the branch and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespersons are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are almost always contracted at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to cover loads some branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international and air shipments 

  

salespersons in the branches both sell and service their customers rather than rely exclusively on a central office or dedicated sales staff sales opportunities are identified through the company’s database industry directories referrals by existing customers and leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets each branch is also responsible for locating and contracting with carriers 

  

as of december 31 2001 robinson’s branch salespersons represented approximately 71 of the company’s total work force and all branch employees including support staff represented over 82 of the company’s work force at december 31 2001 the number of salespersons per branch ranged from two to approximately 475 

  

branch expansion robinson expects to continue to add branch offices as management determines that a new branch may contribute to continued growth and as branch salespersons develop the capability to manage a new branch robinson intends to continue to open overseas branches as opportunities arise to serve the local needs of multinational customers additional branches are often opened within a territory previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch capital required to open a new branch is modest involving a lease for a small amount of office space communication links and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time 

  

branch employees for almost two decades new branch salespersons have been hired through a sophisticated profiling system using standardized tests to measure an applicant against the traits determined by the company to be those of successful robinson employees these common traits facilitate cooperative efforts necessary for the success of each office applicants are recruited from across the united states canada mexico south america and europe typically have college degrees and some have business experience not necessarily within the transportation industry the company is highly selective in determining to whom it offers employment 

  

newly hired branch employees receive extensive onthejob training at the branch level which ranges from six months to a year and emphasizes development of the necessary skills and attitude to become productive members of a branch team the company believes most salespersons become productive employees in a matter of weeks after gaining approximately a year of experience each salesperson attends a companysponsored national meeting to receive additional training and foster relationships between branches 

  

employees at the branch level form a team which is enhanced by robinson’s incentive compensation system under this system part of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespersons is dependent 

  

on the profitability of the particular branch or business unit for any calendar year branch managers and salespersons who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year based on a system of “points” awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contribution most of a branch manager’s cash compensation is provided by this compensation program for 2001 incentivebased cash compensation averaged approximately 30 of branch salespersons’ total cash compensation 68 of branch managers’ total cash compensation and 63 of officers’ total cash compensation branch employees can earn significant individual incentive compensation based on achieving individual growth goals and in the company’s profit sharing plan contributions that depend on overall company profitability and other factors in connection with establishing new branches and other special circumstances robinson may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons 

  

all managers and other employees throughout the company who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in the company’s 1997 omnibus stock plan employees at all levels after a qualifying period of employment are eligible to participate in the company’s employee stock purchase plan 

  

individual salespersons benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals and are motivated by the opportunity to become branch managers assistant managers or department managers all branch salespersons are full time employees 

  

executive officers 

  

under the company’s decentralized operating system branch managers report directly to and receive guidance and support from a small group of executive officers at the company’s central office customers carriers managers and employees have direct access to dr verdoorn the company’s chief executive officer john wiehoff the company’s president and all other executive officers these executives provide training and education concerning logistics develop new services and applications to be offered to customers and provide broad market analysis

customers and marketing 

  

robinson seeks to establish longterm relationships with its customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by seeking to provide the customer with a full range of logistics services the company serves over 15000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2001 no customer accounted for more than 7 of gross revenues or 3 of gross profits in recent years revenue growth has been achieved through the growth and consolidation of customers expansion of the services provided by the company and an increase in the number of customers served 

  

robinson believes that decentralization allows salespersons to better serve its customers by fostering the development of a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers with the guidance of experienced branch managers who have an average tenure of 11 years with the company branches are given significant latitude in pursuing opportunities and committing the company’s resources to serve customers 

  

branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that the company is capable of providing robinson has begun placing increased emphasis on national sales and marketing support to enhance branch capabilities increasingly branches call on central office executives a national sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements 

  

relationships with carriers 

  

robinson seeks to establish longterm relationships with carriers in order to assure dependable services favorable pricing and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods of undercapacity to strengthen and maintain these relationships company salespersons regularly communicate with carriers serving their region and seek to assist carriers with equipment utilization reduction of empty miles and equipment repositioning the company has a policy of prompt payment and provides centralized claims management on behalf of various shippers many smaller carriers effectively consider robinson as their sales and marketing department 

  

as of december 31 2001 robinson had contracts with approximately 20000 motor carriers providing access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds those carriers include owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently the company is not dependent on any one carrier robinson qualifies each motor carrier to assure that it is properly licensed and insured and has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis 

  

as of december 31 2001 robinson also had intermodal marketing contracts with railroads including all of the major north american railroads giving the company access to additional trailers and containers the company’s contracts with railroads govern the transportation services and payment terms by which robinson’s intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between the company and the railroad on a customerspecific basis 

  

competition 

  

the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented the company competes primarily against a large number of other nonasset based logistics companies as well as assetbased logistics companies thirdparty freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders robinson also competes against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ own transportation departments it also buys and sells transportation services from and to companies with which it competes 

  

the company often competes with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believes that its most significant competitive advantages are 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

communications and information systems 

  

to handle the large number of daily transactions and to accommodate its decentralized branch system the company has designed an extensive communications and information system employees are linked with each other and with customers and carriers by telephone facsimile internet email andor edi to communicate requirements and availability to confirm and bill orders and through the company’s internet sites chrwonline and chrwtruckscom to contract loads or equipment and track and trace shipments customers and carriers also have access to robinson’s systems through the internet the company has developed its own proprietary computer based systems that help salespersons service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate loads and select routes all based on customerspecific service parameters these systems also make load data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers enabling the salespersons to select carriers and track loads in progress and automatically provide visible alerts to any arising problems robinson’s internally developed proprietary decision support system uses data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports which are available to the company’s logistics customers to provide information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and enables customers to analyze their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute and outofstock costs 

  

government regulation 

  

the transportation industry has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes that have affected the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and cost of providing transportation services the company cannot predict the effect if any that future legislative and regulatory changes may have on the transportation industry 

  

robinson is subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation provider the company is licensed by the department of transportation “dot” as a broker in arranging for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements the company provides motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the dot including a requirement to maintain 

  

insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts the company is subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and maintains a nonvessel operating common carrier bond the company operates as an indirect air cargo carrier subject to economic regulation by the dot the company provides customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the united states customs service of the department of treasury the company sources fresh produce under a license issued by the united states department of agriculture other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations the company’s tchek operations have recently become subject to federal and state money transfer regulations although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight the company and several of its subsidiaries continue to be subject to a variety of licensing requirements the company and the carriers that the company relies on in arranging transportation services for its customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact the company’s operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject the company to fines or in the event of serious violation suspension or revocation of operating authority as well as increased claims liability 

  

risk management and insurance 

  

in its truck and intermodal operations robinson assumes cargo risk to its customers the company subrogates its losses against the motor or rail carrier with the transportation responsibilities robinson requires all motor carriers participating in its contract program to carry at least 750000 in general auto insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance many carriers carry insurance limits exceeding these minimums railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment for both truck and rail transportation higher coverage is available to the customer on a loadbyload basis at an additional price 

  

in its international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses the company does not assume cargo liability to its customers above minimum industry standards robinson offers its customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when the company agrees to store goods for its customers for longer terms it provides limited warehouseman’s coverage to its customers and contracts for warehousing services from companies that provide robinson the same degree of coverage 

  

the company maintains a broad cargo liability policy to protect it against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier robinson also carries various liability policies including auto and general liability with a 100 million umbrella 

  

agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination has led to recalls of products and tort claims have been brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because the company is a seller of produce it may have legal responsibility arising from sales of produce while the company carries product liability coverage of 75 million settlement of class action claims is often costly and robinson cannot assure that its liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available in addition in connection with any recall robinson may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product for which it is not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect the company’s reputation particularly of its the fresh 1 ® brand loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business

  robinson has developed global multimodal transportation and distribution networks to provide seamless logistics services worldwide as a result the company has the capability of managing all aspects of the supply chain on behalf of its customers as a nonasset based transportation provider robinson can focus on optimizing the transportation solution for its customer rather than on its own asset utilization using established relationships with motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers air freight carriers and ocean carriers 

  throughout its 95year history the company has been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of robinson’s logistics expertise can be traced to its significant experience in handling perishable commodities due to the timesensitive nature and quality requirements of the shipments fresh produce represents a unique logistics challenge and the distribution and transportation costs are significant robinson has developed a network of produce sources and maintains access to specialized equipment and transportation modes designed to ensure timely delivery of uniform quality produce in response to demand from large grocery retailers and food service distributors the company has developed its own brand of produce the fresh 1® and entered into licensing agreements for national brand names the produce for these brands is sourced through various relationships and packed to order through contract packing agreements 

  robinson’s business philosophy has accounted for its strong historical results and has positioned the company for continued growth the company’s principal competitive advantage is its large decentralized branch network staffed by approximately 2590 salespersons who are employees rather than agents these branch employees are in close proximity to both customers and carriers which facilitates quick responses to customers’ changing needs branch employees act as a team in both marketing robinson’s services and providing these services to individual customers robinson compensates its branch employees principally on the basis of individual performance and their branch’s profitability which in the company’s opinion produces a more serviceoriented focused and creative sales force the company believes more than 1000 of its employees hold approximately half of the company’s common stock 

  the company was reincorporated in delaware in 1997 as the successor to a business existing in various legal forms since 1905 robinson’s common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market under the symbol “chrw” on october 15 1997 certain stockholders of the company sold 24330310 shares of the company’s common stock to the public pursuant to a registered public offering the proceeds of which were paid entirely to the selling stockholders prior to such date there was no established public trading market for the company’s common stock

logistics services 

  as a global thirdparty logistics company robinson provides multimodal transportation and related logistics services sourcing and feebased information services 

  the company seeks to establish longterm relationships with its customers in order to provide logistics solutions that reduce or eliminate inefficiencies in customers’ supply chains whenever appropriate robinson analyzes the customer’s current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection robinson may also examine the customer’s warehousing picking procedures loading unloading and dock scheduling procedures as well as packaging and pallet configuration procedures the company then evaluates how these procedures interact with shipping manufacturing and customer service upon completion of an initial analysis robinson proposes solutions that allow the customer to streamline operating procedures and contain costs while improving the management of its supply chain robinson branch employees remain involved with the customer throughout the analysis and implementation of the proposed solution in the course of providing daytoday transportation services branch employees offer further logistics analysis and solutions as the employees become more familiar with the customer’s daily operations and the nuances of its supply chain the company’s ultimate goal is to assist the customer in managing its entire supply chain while being the customer’s key provider of individual transportation services 

multimodal transportation services 

  on a daytoday basis customers communicate their freight needs typically on a loadbyload basis to robinson by means of a telephone call fax transmission internet email or edi message to the branch office salesperson responsible for the particular customer all appropriate information about each load is entered into the company’s computer based operating system with the help of the operating system a salesperson then determines the appropriate mode of transportation for the load and selects a carrier or carriers based upon the salesperson’s knowledge of the carrier’s service capability equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors a salesperson then communicates with the carrier’s dispatch office to confirm a price for the transportation and the carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation at this point the salesperson provides the carrier information to the customer together with the company’s sales price which is intended to provide a profit to robinson for the totality of services performed for the customer by accepting the customer’s order robinson becomes legally responsible for transportation of the load from origin to destination rather than being a mere freight broker the carrier’s contract is with robinson not the customer and robinson is responsible for prompt payment of carrier charges robinson is also responsible to its customer for any claims for damage to freight while in transit or performance in most cases robinson receives reimbursement from the carrier for these claims 

  as a result of its logistics capabilities many customers now look to robinson to handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements to or from a particular manufacturing facility or distribution center in a number of instances robinson has contracts with the customer whereby robinson agrees to handle a specified number of loads usually to specified destinations such as from the customer’s plant to a distribution center at specific rates but subject to seasonal variation most of the company’s rate commitments are for periods of one year or less to meet its obligations under these customer contracts robinson may obtain advance commitments from one or more carriers to transport all or a significant portion of the contracted loads again at specific rates for the length of robinson’s customer contract 

  as part of its customer focus robinson offers a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis to assure timely efficient and cost effective delivery through the use of one or more transportation modes these logistics services include transportation management price and modal comparisons and selection shipment consolidation and optimization improvement of operating and shipping procedures and claims management minimization of storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations logistics network and nodal location analysis to optimize the entire supply chain tracking and tracing reverse logistics and other special needs management information and analysis of a customer’s risk and claims management practices robinson will evaluate a customer’s core carrier program by reviewing such factors as carriers’ insurance certificates safety ratings and financial stability as well as establishing a program to measure and monitor key quality standards for those core carriers these services are bundled with underlying transportation services and are not typically 

separately priced but instead are reflected as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by the company on a transactional basis pursuant to continuing customer relationships in addition to these transportation services robinson may supply sourcing contract warehousing consulting and other services for which it is separately compensated 

the company is capable of arranging all modes of transportation services on a worldwide basis 

truck — through its contracts with approximately 20000 motor carriers robinson maintains access to dry vans temperaturecontrolled units and flatbeds it offers both timedefinite and expedited truck transportation in many instances particularly in connection with its sourcing business the company will consolidate partial loads for several customers into full truckloads 

  less than truckload “ltl” — ltl transportation involves the shipment of small package single or multiple pallet up to and including full trailerload freight robinson focuses on pallet to partial load freight although it handles any size shipment through contracts with motor carriers and its proprietary internetbased software system robinson consolidates both freight and freight information to provide shippers with single source tracking and tracing capability and the economic benefits of consolidating partial loads into full truckloads 

intermodal — intermodal transportation involves the shipment of trailers or containers by a combination of truck rail andor ship in a coordinated manner robinson provides intermodal service by both rail and ship arranges local pickup and delivery known as drayage through local motor carriers and provides temperaturecontrolled double and triplestacked intermodal containers the company currently owns or leases approximately 500 intermodal containers robinson also has intermodal marketing contracts with railroads which give the company access to additional trailers and containers 

ocean — as an indirect ocean carrier and freight forwarder robinson consolidates shipments determines routing selects ocean carriers contracts for ocean shipments provides for local pickup and delivery of shipments and arranges for customs clearance of shipments including the payment of duties 

air — the company provides doortodoor service as a fullservice air freight forwarder both domestically and internationally the table below shows the company’s net revenues by transportation mode for the periods indicated

sourcing 

  throughout its 95year history robinson has been in the business of sourcing fresh produce much of the company’s logistics expertise can be traced to robinson’s significant experience in handling perishable commodities because of its perishable nature produce must be quickly packaged transported within tight timetables in temperature controlled equipment and distributed quickly to replenish high turnover inventories maintained by wholesalers food service companies and retailers in most instances robinson consolidates individual customers’ produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arranges for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations the company’s sourcing business is with produce wholesalers who purchase produce in relatively large quantities through robinson and resell the produce to grocery retailers restaurants and other resellers of food and with grocery store chains and other multistore retailers most of robinson’s remaining customers are food service companies that distribute a range of food products to retailers restaurants and institutions 

  during the past five years the company has actively sought to expand its food sourcing customer base by focusing on the larger multistore retailers as these retailers have expanded through store openings and industry consolidation their traditional methods of produce sourcing and storelevel distribution which relied principally on regional or even local purchases from wholesalers have become inefficient robinson’s logistics and perishable commodities sourcing expertise can greatly improve the retailers’ produce purchasing as well as assure uniform quality from region to region and store to store the company provides justintime replenishment services to retailers the company introduced its proprietary the fresh 1® brand of produce in 1989 which includes a wide range of uniform quality top grade fruits and vegetables purchased from various domestic and international growers during 1998 robinson entered into new sourcing programs including licensing agreements for major national brands that have expanded the company’s market presence and sourcing capabilities with respect to both product lines and nationally recognized brand names 

  sourcing accounted for approximately 18 15 and 10 of the company’s net revenues in 1998 1999 and 2000 respectively 

information services 

  a subsidiary of the company tchek systems inc provides motor carrier customers with funds transfer and driver payroll services fuel management services fuel and use tax reporting as well as online access to customtailored information management reports all through the use of its proprietary automated system this system enables motor carriers to track equipment manage fleets and dictate where and when their drivers purchase fuel for several companies and truck stop chains tchek captures sales and fuel cost data applies the margin agreed between seller and purchaser reprices the sale invoices the carrier and provides management information to the seller 

  through its subsidiary payment  logistics services inc the company provides freight payment services to shippers using a proprietary system often linked to the carriers by edi with the ability to process freight payments by electronic funds transfer this system also enables robinson to automatically audit the customer’s freight rates eliminate duplicate payments to carriers and produce reports containing information about such matters as shipping patterns freight volumes and overall transportation costs upon agreement the company and the customer can use this data to better manage the customer’s supply chain robinson is not actively trying to grow this business freight payment and audit is an extremely competitive industry requiring large volumes of business to be profitable robinson has continued in this business primarily as an added service to those customers who request it 

  the company’s information services accounted for approximately 5 6 and 5 of the company’s net revenues in 1998 1999 and 2000 respectively

  to allow the company to stay close to customers and markets robinson has created and continues to expand a network of 137 offices supported by executives and services in a central office

  branch salespersons are responsible for developing new business receiving and processing orders from specific customers and customers located in the area served by the branch and contracting with carriers to provide the transportation requested in addition to routine transportation salespersons are often called upon to handle customers’ unusual seasonal and emergency needs shipments to be transported by truck are almost always contracted at the branch level and branches cooperate with each other to cover loads some branches may rely on expertise in other branches when contracting ltl intermodal international and air shipments 

  salespersons in the branches both sell and service their customers rather than rely exclusively on a central office or dedicated sales staff sales opportunities are identified through the company’s database industry directories referrals by existing customers and leads generated by branch office personnel through knowledge of their local and regional markets each branch is also responsible for locating and contracting with carriers 

the table below shows certain information about the company’s branches for the periods indicated 

   as of december 31 2000 robinson’s branch salespersons represented approximately 71 of the company’s total work force and all branch employees including support staff represented over 84 of the company’s work force at december 31 2000 the number of salespersons per company branch ranged from three to approximately 450 including salespersons and customer support at american backhaulers 

  branch expansion robinson expects to continue to add branch offices as management determines that a new branch may contribute to continued growth and as branch salespersons develop the capability to manage a new branch robinson intends to continue to open overseas branches as opportunities arise to serve the local needs of multinational customers additional branches are often opened within a territory previously served by another branch such as within major cities as the volume of business in a particular area warrants opening a separate branch capital required to open a new branch is modest involving a lease for a small amount of office space communication links and often employee compensation guaranties for a short time 

  branch employees for almost two decades new branch salespersons have been hired through a sophisticated profiling system using standardized tests to measure an applicant against the traits determined by the company to be those of successful robinson employees these common traits facilitate cooperative efforts necessary for the success of each office applicants are recruited nationally from across the united states and canada typically have college degrees and some have business experience not necessarily within the transportation industry the company is highly selective in determining to whom it offers employment 

  newly hired branch employees receive extensive onthejob training at the branch level which ranges from six months to a year and emphasizes development of the necessary skills and attitude to become productive members of a branch team the company believes most salespersons become productive employees in a matter of weeks after gaining approximately a year of experience each salesperson attends a companysponsored national meeting to receive additional training and foster relationships between branches 

  employees at the branch level form a team which is enhanced by robinson’s incentive compensation system under this system part of the cash compensation of most branch managers and salespersons is dependent 

on the profitability of the particular branch or business unit for any calendar year branch managers and salespersons who have been employed for at least one complete year are paid a portion of the branch’s earnings for that calendar year based on a system of “points” awarded to the employees on the basis of their productivity and contribution most of a branch manager’s cash compensation is provided by this compensation program for 2000 incentivebased cash compensation averaged approximately 35 of branch salespersons’ total cash compensation 64 of branch managers’ total cash compensation and 64 of officers’ total cash compensation branch employees can earn significant individual incentive compensation based on achieving individual growth goals and in the company’s profit sharing plan contributions that depend on overall company profitability and other factors in connection with establishing new branches and other special circumstances robinson may guarantee a level of compensation to the branch manager and key salespersons 

  all managers and other employees throughout the company who have significant responsibilities are eligible to participate in the company’s 1997 omnibus stock plan employees at all levels after a qualifying period of employment are eligible to participate in the company’s employee stock purchase plan 

  individual salespersons benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual branches and by achieving individual goals and are motivated by the opportunity to become branch managers assistant managers or department managers all branch salespersons are full time employees

robinson believes that its compensation and benefit plans are among the most competitive in the industry and that its relationship with employees is excellent 

customers and marketing 

  robinson seeks to establish longterm relationships with its customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by seeking to provide the customer with a full range of logistics services the company serves 14000 customers worldwide ranging from fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries during 2000 no customer accounted for more than 8 of gross revenues or 4 of net revenues in recent years revenue growth has been achieved through the growth and consolidation of customers expansion of the services provided by the company and an increase in the number of customers served 

  robinson believes that decentralization allows salespersons to better serve its customers by fostering the development of a broad knowledge of logistics and local and regional market conditions as well as the specific logistics issues facing individual customers with the guidance of experienced branch managers who have an average tenure of 12 years with the company branches are given significant latitude in pursuing opportunities and committing the company’s resources to serve customers 

  branches seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on their knowledge of local markets and the range and value of logistics services that the company is capable of providing robinson has begun placing increased emphasis on national sales and marketing support to enhance branch capabilities increasingly branches call on central office executives a national sales staff and a central logistics group to support them in the pursuit of multinational corporations and other companies with more complex logistics requirements 

relationships with carriers 

  robinson seeks to establish longterm relationships with carriers in order to assure dependable services favorable pricing and carrier availability during peak shipping periods and periods of undercapacity to strengthen and maintain these relationships company salespersons regularly communicate with carriers serving their region and seek to assist carriers with equipment utilization reduction of empty miles and equipment repositioning the company has a policy of prompt payment and provides centralized claims management on behalf of various shippers many smaller carriers effectively consider robinson as their sales and marketing department 

  as of december 31 2000 robinson had contracts with approximately 20000 motor carriers providing access to temperature controlled vans dry vans and flatbeds those carriers include owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies consequently the company is not dependent on any one carrier as of december 31 2000 robinson also had intermodal marketing contracts with railroads including all of the major north american railroads giving the company access to additional trailers and containers robinson qualifies each motor carrier to assure that it is properly licensed and insured and has the resources to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis the company’s motor carrier contracts require that the carrier commit to a minimum number of shipments issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from robinson and permit robinson to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages carrier contracts also establish transportation rates that can be modified by issuance of an individual load confirmation the company’s contracts with railroads govern the transportation services and payment terms by which robinson’s intermodal shipments are transported by rail intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between the company and the railroad on a customerspecific basis 

competition 

  the transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented the company competes primarily against a large number of other nonasset based logistics companies as well as assetbased logistics companies thirdparty freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and freight forwarders robinson also competes against carriers’ internal sales forces and shippers’ own transportation departments it also buys and sells transportation services from and to companies with which it competes 

  the company often competes with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believes that its most significant competitive advantages are 

its large decentralized branch network staffed by salespersons who are employees rather than agents which enables the company’s salespersons to gain significant knowledge about individual customers carriers and the local and regional markets they serve 

its technology including internet communications capabilities 

its ability to provide a broad range of logistics services and 

its ability to provide doortodoor services on a worldwide basis communications and information systems 

  to handle the large number of daily transactions and to accommodate its decentralized branch system the company has designed an extensive communications and information system employees are linked with each other and with customers and carriers by telephone facsimile internet email andor edi to communicate requirements and availability to confirm and bill orders and through the company’s internet home page chrw ecenter wwwchrobinsoncom to contract loads or equipment and track and trace shipments customers and carriers also have access to robinson’s systems through the chrw ecenter the company has developed its own proprietary computer based systems that help salespersons service customer orders select the optimal modes of transportation build and consolidate loads and selects routes all based on customerspecific service parameters makes load data visible to the entire sales team as well as customers and carriers enabling the salespersons to select carriers and track loads in progress and automatically provides visible alerts to any arising problems robinson’s internally developed proprietary decision support system uses data captured from daily transactions to generate various management reports which are available to the company’s logistics customers to provide information on traffic patterns product mix and production schedules and enables customers to analyze their own customer base transportation expenditure trends and the impact on outofroute and outofstock costs 

government regulation 

  the transportation industry has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes that have affected the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and cost of providing transportation services the company cannot predict the effect if any that future legislative and regulatory changes may have on the transportation industry 

  robinson is subject to licensing and regulation as a transportation provider the company is licensed by the department of transportation “dot” as a broker in arranging for the transportation of property by motor vehicle the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements the company provides motor carrier transportation services that require registration with the dot and compliance with certain economic regulations administered by the dot including a requirement to maintain insurance coverage in minimum prescribed amounts the company is subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and maintains a nonvessel operating common carrier bond the company operates as an indirect air cargo carrier subject to economic regulation by the dot the company provides customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the united states customs service of the department of treasury the company sources fresh produce under a license issued by the united states department of agriculture other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations although congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight the company and several of its subsidiaries continue to be subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements the company and the carriers that the company relies on in arranging transportation services for its customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on the company’s operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact the company’s operations in the future violation of these regulations could also subject the company to fines or in the event of serious violation suspension or revocation of operating authority as well as increased claims liability 

risk management and insurance 

  in its truck and intermodal operations robinson assumes full value cargo risk to its customers the company subrogates its losses against the motor or rail carrier with the transportation responsibilities robinson requires all motor carriers participating in its contract program to carry at least 100 million in general liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance many carriers carry insurance limits exceeding these minimums railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment for both truck and rail transportation higher coverage is available to the customer on a loadbyload basis at an additional price 

  in its international freight forwarding ocean transportation and air freight businesses the company does not assume cargo liability to its customers above minimum industry standards robinson offers its customers the option to purchase ocean marine cargo coverage to insure goods in transit when the company agrees to store goods for its customers for longer terms it provides limited warehouseman’s coverage to its customers and contracts for warehousing services from companies that provide robinson the same degree of coverage 

  the company maintains a broad cargo liability policy to protect it against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible carrier robinson also carries various liability policies including auto and general liability with a 100 million umbrella 

  agricultural chemicals used on agricultural commodities intended for human consumption are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination has led to recalls of products and tort claims have been brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce because the company is a seller of produce it may have legal responsibility arising from sales of produce while the company carries product liability coverage of 75 million settlement of class action claims is often costly and robinson cannot assure that its liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available in addition in connection with any recall robinson may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product for which it is not insured any recall or allegation of contamination could affect the company’s reputation particularly of it’s the fresh 1® brand loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business
