intellectual property 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology we periodically have discussions with third parties regarding licensing fortinet’s intellectual property “ip” and have sometimes taken legal action against competitors to protect our ip and as a result third parties have paid us fees in return for licenses or covenantsnottosue related to fortinet ip as of december 31 2021 we had 1255 us and foreignissued patents and 254 pending us and foreign patent applications we also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products including open source software and other software 

despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our 

proprietary information however we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other ip rights third parties have asserted are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark or other ip rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a thirdparty could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected in certain instances we indemnify our endcustomers distributors and resellers against claims that our products infringe the ip of third parties 

government regulation 

we are subject to regulation by various federal state regional local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety product labeling environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws data privacy laws import and export controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations many of the laws and regulations that are or may be applicable to our business are changing or being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could adversely impact our business in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain particularly in the industry in which we operate we believe we are in compliance with current laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty we do not currently expect compliance to have a material adverse effect 

seasonality 

for information regarding seasonality in our sales see the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product security performance throughput features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

• addition and integration of new networking and security features and technological expertise 

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

• brand recognition 

• customer service and support across varied and complex customer segments and use cases 

• sales and distribution capabilities 

• size and financial stability 

• breadth of product line 

• form factor of the solution and 

• other competitive differentiators 

among others our competitors include barracuda networks inc “barracuda” check point software technologies ltd “check point” cisco systems inc “cisco” crowdstrike holdings inc “crowdstrike” f5 networks inc “f5 networks” forcepoint llc “forcepoint” imperva inc “imperva” juniper networks inc “juniper” mandiant inc “mandiant” mcafee llc “mcafee” palo alto networks inc “palo alto networks” proofpoint inc “proofpoint” sonicwall inc “sonicwall” sophos group plc “sophos” trend micro incorporated “trend micro” and zscaler inc “zscaler” 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ security performance throughput reliability breadth and ability to work together our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionalities to our products 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements market consolidation supply chain constraints price list or discount changes or inflation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance are better marketed or achieve greater market acceptance than our products additionally our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are better positioned to withstand a significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business

risks related to our business and financial position 

our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control or may be difficult to predict including

• increases or decreases in our billings revenue and expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or a strengthening of the us dollar as a significant portion of our expenses is incurred and paid in currencies other than the us dollar and the impact such fluctuations may have on the actual prices that our partners and customers are willing to pay for our products and services

• changes in our estimated annual effective tax rates 

• changes in circumstances and challenges in business conditions including decreased demand which may negatively impact our channel partners’ ability to sell the current inventory they hold and negatively impact their future purchases of products from us 

• increased demand for cloudbased services and the uncertainty associated with transitioning to providing such services 

  

• our channel partners having insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions 

  

• disruptions in our channel or termination of our relationship with important channel partners including as a result of consolidation among distributors and resellers of security solutions

• legislative or regulatory changes such as with respect to privacy information and cybersecurity exports the environment and applicable accounting standards 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are 

fixed in nature over the near term accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

the covid19 pandemic including its ongoing variants could adversely affect our business in a material way based on for example component shortages or negative impact on demand 

the covid19 pandemic including its ongoing variants has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains and demand for certain solutions and created significant volatility in and disruption of global markets the extent of the future impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance including on demand for our products and services our ability to source components and our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the covid19 pandemic and related restrictions on and disruptions of business and world economies all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict there is a worldwide shortage of various components impacting many industries caused inpart by the covid19 pandemic we are experiencing ongoing component shortages which have resulted in extended lead times of certain products and significant disruption to our production schedule we also have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased component costs which may have a negative impact on our gross margins an extended period of global supply chain disruption demand reduction and economic slowdown would materially negatively affect our overall business and our operating results including billings revenue gross margins operating margins cash flows and other operating results if the covid19 pandemic continues to limit the availability of our products either by limiting components available the actual manufacture and assembly or by limiting or restricting shipping of components and products this could continue to result in increased product backlog and result in lower billings lower revenue and decreased profitability and would negatively impact and may materially negatively impact our operating results and business in addition we may also face personnelrelated risks as restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic begin to ease and we transition back to an inperson working model including that our “return to office” plan may be viewed negatively by employees and lead to attrition or to difficulty in hiring 

moreover the covid19 pandemic has created a reduction in certain business activity and demand for certain solutions which we believe has negatively impacted our billings and may in the future materially and negatively affect the rate and amount of our billings the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect certain of our partners’ and customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our products and services delay certain customers’ purchasing decisions and increase customer attrition rates all of which will adversely affect our future sales and operating results possibly in a material way as a result we may experience extended sales cycles our ability to close transactions with new and existing customers and partners may be negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue from sales we do close may be negatively impacted certain businesses will not buy our products and services when they otherwise would have certain current partners customers and customer prospects may go out of business or face significant business challenges thereby negatively impacting our sales product or component shortages implementation delays or other factors and our ability to provide technical and other support to our customers may be affected we have also offered and may continue to offer payment terms in excess of our contractual agreements to some of our distributors which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to collect from these customers in addition the covid19 pandemic has caused an increase in certain of our expenses including increased shipping costs increased cancellation charges and reduced attendance fees due to the cancellation of several of our 2021 accelerate sales conferences and has resulted in increased component and product manufacturing costs the covid19 pandemic has limited certain demand generation activities such as conferences and inperson sales meetings which may reduce our costs but also may reduce leads that could result in closed sales the full impact of the covid19 pandemic is unknown at this time while we continue to monitor developments and the potential effect on our business it is clear that the covid19 pandemic will negatively impact certain sales and may have a material negative impact on our operating results in the near term and longer term 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global and regional economic conditions and spending environments geopolitical instability and uncertainty weak economic conditions in certain regions or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions including the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the foregoing issues could have adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our channel partners reduced unit sales and slower or declining growth 

our billings revenue and free cash flow growth may slow or may not continue and our operating margins may decline 

  

we may experience slowing growth or a decrease in billings revenue operating margin and free cash flow for a number of reasons including as a result of the covid19 pandemic a slowdown in demand for our products or services a shift 

in demand from products to services increased competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market or softness in demand in certain geographies or industry verticals such as the service provider industry changes in our strategic opportunities execution risks and our failure for any reason to continue to capitalize on sales and growth opportunities due to other risks identified in the risk factors described in this periodic report our expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expected if our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings and revenue growth we may experience margin declines in addition we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue and do not appropriately manage our cost structure free cash flow or encounter unanticipated liabilities as a result any failure by us to maintain profitability and margins and continue our billings revenue and free cash flow growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder chief executive officer and chairman or michael xie our cofounder president and chief technology officer or of any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives the loss of the services or the distraction of our senior management for any reason including the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners for substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results may be harmed additionally a small number of distributors represents a large percentage of our revenue and gross accounts receivable and one distributor accounted for 33 of our total net accounts receivable as of december 31 2021 

  

a significant portion of our sales is generated through a limited number of distributors and substantially all of our revenue is from sales by our channel partners including distributors and resellers we depend on our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities and to manage our sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our products or our channel partners shift focus to other vendors andor our competitors our ability to sell our products and operating results may be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

in addition a small number of channel partners represents a large percentage of our revenue and gross accounts receivable we are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of some of our channel partners and to credit exposure in weakened markets which could result in material losses our dependence on a limited number of key channel partners means that our billings revenue and operating results may be harmed by the inability of these key channel partners to successfully sell our products and services or if any of these key channel partners is unable or unwilling to pay us terminates its relationship with us or goes out of business although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate credit and liquidity risks we cannot guarantee these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks if we are unable to adequately control these risks our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed if channel partners fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or we are otherwise unable to collect on our accounts receivable from these channel partners we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts including litigation our channel partners may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us or pay those amounts more slowly either of which could adversely affect our operating results financial position and cash flow we may be further impacted by consolidation of our existing channel partners in such instances we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be more limited we may also become increasingly dependent on a more limited number of channel partners as consolidation increases the relative proportion of our business for which each channel partner is responsible which may magnify the risks described in the preceding paragraphs 

exclusive accounted for 33 and 34 of our total net accounts receivable as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and six distributors accounted for 68 and 70 of our total net accounts receivable in the aggregate as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively during 2021 2020 and 2019 exclusive accounted for 31 30 and 31 of our total revenue respectively in addition to other risks associated with the concentration of accounts receivable and revenue from these distributors exclusive is a private equitybacked company and we may not have sufficient information to assess its financial condition and accordingly if exclusive were to experience financial difficulties we might not have advance notice 

additionally exclusive may face liquidity risk or other financial challenges which may harm our ability to collect on our accounts receivable 

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them with selling our products and incentivize them to sell our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services and may purchase more inventory than they can sell our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions moreover many of our channel partners are privately held including our largest distributor exclusive and we may not have sufficient information to assess their financial condition if our channel partners’ financial condition or operations weaken their ability to sell our product and services could be negatively impacted our channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products or may decide to cease selling our products and services altogether in favor of a competitor’s products and services they may also have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot ensure that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results 

any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers our service provider customers suffer a cyber event impacting end users or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter we typically arrange for a logistics partner to pick up the last shipment of our products a few hours prior to the end of the quarter and a delay in the arrival of the logistics partner or other factors such as a power outage could prevent us from shipping and billing for a material amount of products for which we have orders further it is possible that the dollar value of these products intended to be shipped late on the last day of the quarter may be material additionally our service billings are dependent on the completion of certain automated processes by our internal business management systems some of which cannot be performed until after the related products have been shipped if we do not have enough time after shipping our products for our systems to perform these processes prior to the end of the quarter or we have system issues that prevent processing in time to realize service billings in a quarter we will not be able to bill and realize billings for those services until the following quarter which may materially negatively impact our billings for a particular quarter we implemented a cloudbased quoting tool to help provide our sales team with the ability to have faster quote generation reduce quote errors and increase sales productivity our ability to integrate the data from this tool into our order processing may cause order processing delays that could have an effect on our financial results our billings and revenue for any quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason or our ability to fulfill orders at the end of any quarter is hindered for any reason including among others 

• the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize 

• our logistics partners’ failure or inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter 

• disruption in manufacturing or shipping based on power outages system failures labor disputes or constraints excessive demand natural disasters or widespread public health problems including pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic 

• our failure to accurately forecast our inventory requirements and to appropriately manage inventory to meet demand 

• our inability to release new products on schedule 

• any failure of our systems related to order review and processing and 

• any delays in shipments due to trade compliance requirements labor disputes or logistics changes at shipping ports airline strikes severe weather or otherwise 

we rely significantly on revenue from fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services and revenue from these services may decline or fluctuate because we recognize revenue from these services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue revenue from the sale of new or from the renewal of existing fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in purchases of fortigate appliances or our fortinet security fabric cybersecurity mesh platform products changes in the sales mix between products and services endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors reductions in our customers’ spending levels and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to these arrangements if our sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business could suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact our billings and revenue furthermore we recognize fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically from one to five years as a result much of the fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts entered into during previous quarters or years consequently a decline in new or renewed fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services is not reflected in full in our statements of income until future periods our fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

  

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering sales and marketing may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we experience turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success 

competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense especially for qualified sales support and engineering employees in network security and especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel such as the san francisco bay area and the vancouver canada area we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs the covid19 pandemic may also decelerate our hiring and increase the challenge of recruiting qualified personnel to leave their current positions to join us in addition to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information changes in immigration laws including changes to the rules regarding h1b visas may also harm our ability to attract personnel from other countries our inability to hire properly qualified and effective sales support and engineering employees could harm our growth and our ability to effectively support growth 

we have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

as of december 31 2021 we had an aggregate of 9884 million of indebtedness outstanding under our senior notes under the agreements governing our indebtedness we are permitted to incur additional debt this debt and any debt that we may incur in the future may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

• increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions and 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and our industries 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital operating or investment expenditures such measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 

additionally the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to comply with certain covenants if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the noteholders then subject to applicable cure periods any or all of our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable there can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us if at all 

under the terms of our outstanding senior notes we may be required to repurchase the notes for cash prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain changes of control that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the notes the repayment obligations under the notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a negative impact on our cash position and liquidity and impair our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our unsecured revolving credit facility may increase in addition any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may negatively impact the terms of any such financing 

risks related to our sales and endcustomers 

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world our international sales have represented a majority of our total revenue in recent periods therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

• economic or political instability in foreign markets 

  

• greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection including longer collection periods 

• longer sales processes for larger deals particularly during the summer months or as a result of the covid19 pandemic and related travel and gathering restrictions 

• changes in regulatory requirements 

  

• difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations 

  

• the uncertainty of protection for ip rights in some countries 

  

• costs of compliance with foreign policies laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance with such policies laws and regulations 

• disruption in the supply chain or in manufacturing or shipping or decreases in demand by channel partners or endcustomers including any such disruption or decreases caused by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and health emergencies including earthquakes droughts fires power outages typhoons floods pandemics or epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic and manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars and critical infrastructure attacks 

• protectionist policies and penalties and local laws requirements policies and perceptions that may adversely impact a usheadquartered business’s sales in certain countries outside of the us 

  

• costs of complying with and the risks reputational damage and other costs of noncompliance with us or other foreign laws and regulations for foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” import and export control laws trade laws and regulations tariffs and retaliatory measures trade barriers and economic sanctions 

• other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets and the risks and costs of noncompliance 

• heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales or salesrelated arrangements such as sales “side agreements” to allow return rights that could disrupt the sales team through terminations of employment or otherwise and may adversely impact financial results as compared to those already reported or forecasted and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements 

• our ability to effectively implement and maintain adequate internal controls to properly manage our international sales and operations 

• political unrest changes and uncertainty associated with terrorism hostilities war or natural disasters 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

• management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion and 

• changes in tax tariff employment and other laws 

  

the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic may enhance the severity and unpredictability of a number of the foregoing risks and the risks to our business presented by the covid19 pandemic may be more significant and for a longer term in certain international geographies where we do meaningful business 

product and service sales and employee and contractor matters may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep up to date with changes in government requirements as they change over time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in litigation regulatory action costs of investigation delays in revenue recognition delays in financial reporting financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may undertake corporate operating restructurings or transfers of assets that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad in order to maximize the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure if ineffectual such restructurings or transfers could increase our income tax liabilities and in turn increase our global effective tax rate moreover our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner that we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws however the tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results 

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations while we have increased sales in recent periods to large and mediumsized businesses our sales volume varies by quarter and there is risk as to our level of success selling to these target customers such sales involve unique sales skillsets processes and structures are often more complex and feature a longer contract term and may be at higher discount levels we also have experienced uneven traction selling to certain government organizations and service providers and mssps and there can be no assurance that we will be successful selling to these customers sales to these organizations involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller entities these risks include 

• increased competition from competitors that traditionally target large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations and that may already have purchase commitments from those endcustomers 

  

• increased purchasing power and leverage held by large endcustomers in negotiating contractual arrangements 

• unanticipated changes in the capital resources or purchasing behavior of large endcustomers including changes in the volume and frequency of their purchases and changes in the mix of products and services willingness to change to cloud delivery model and related payment terms 

  

• more stringent support requirements in our support service contracts including stricter support response times more complex requirements and increased penalties for any failure to meet support requirements 

• longer sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential endcustomer that elects not to purchase our products and services 

• increased requirements from these customers that we have certain thirdparty security or other certifications which we may not have the lack of which may adversely affect our ability to successfully sell to such customers 

• uncertainty as to timing to close large deals and any delays in closing those deals and 

• longer rampup periods for enterprise sales personnel as compared to other sales personnel 

  

large and mediumsized businesses service providers and mssps and government organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases longer than 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with endcustomers along with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales in addition purchases by large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays in light of the current covid19 pandemic and regulations in place by various government authorities some of these sales cycles are being further extended furthermore service providers and mssps represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or continued changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business large and mediumsized businesses service providers and mssps and government organizations typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability expect a broader range of services including design implementation and post golive services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue 

recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors in addition large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations may require that our products and services be sold differently from how we offer our products and services which could negatively impact our operating results our large business and service provider customers may also become more deliberate in their purchases as they plan their nextgeneration network security architecture leading them to take more time in making purchasing decisions or to purchase based only on their immediate needs all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers in addition if sales expected from a large and mediumsized endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition mitigation and containment measures adopted by government authorities to contain the spread of covid19 in the united states and internationally including travel restrictions and other requirements that limit inperson meetings could limit our ability to establish and maintain relationships with new and existing customers which may exacerbate the risks described above 

if we do not increase the effectiveness of our sales organization we may have difficulty adding new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomers and our business may be adversely affected 

although we have a channel sales model sales in our industry are complex and members of our sales organization often engage in direct interaction with our prospective endcustomers particularly for larger deals involving larger endcustomers therefore we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales organization to obtain new endcustomers and sell additional products and services to our existing endcustomers there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require including experienced enterprise sales employees and others our ability to grow our revenue depends in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth and on the effectiveness of those personnel in selling successfully in different contexts each of which has its own different complexities approaches and competitive landscapes such as managing and growing the channel business for sales to small businesses and more actively selling to the endcustomer for sales to larger organizations new hires require substantial training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect especially in light of the covid19 pandemic and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business furthermore hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity if our sales employees do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected our revenue may not increase at anticipated levels and our ability to achieve longterm projections may be negatively impacted if we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing customer base our business operating results and prospects may be adversely affected if we do not hire properly qualified and effective sales employees and organize our sales team effectively to capture the opportunities in the various customer segments we are targeting our growth and ability to effectively support growth may be harmed 

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products and to improve lead generation and sales enablement our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly the market for sales to large businesses service providers and government organizations while we have increased our investments in sales and marketing it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased revenue if our investments in additional sales personnel or our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market awareness of our company and products or increasing lead generation or if we experience turnover and disruption in our sales and marketing teams we may not be able to achieve sustained growth and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected we are also limited in our marketing efforts as a result of the covid19 pandemic as mitigation and containment measures adopted by government authorities to contain the spread of covid19 including travel restrictions and other requirements that limit inperson meetings could limit our ability to establish and maintain relationships with new and existing customers and negatively affect our sales and marketing efforts 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods sales to government organizations are subject to a number of risks selling to government organizations can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense with long sales cycles and without any assurance of winning a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

• public sector budgetary cycles 

• the government has and in the future may require them to make operational changes in order to obtain the necessary approvals to sell into the government 

• funding authorizations and requirements unique to government agencies with funding or purchasing reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products 

• geopolitical matters including tariff and trade disputes government shutdowns and trade protectionism and other political dynamics that may adversely affect our ability to sell in certain locations or obtain the requisite permits and clearances required for certain purchases by government organizations of our products and services and 

• rules and regulations applicable to certain government sales including us general service administration regulations and certain thirdparty security certifications and changes to such rules and regulations that may require us to make operational changes in order to obtain the necessary approvals to sell to government agencies 

government spending may also be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

the rules and regulations applicable to sales to government organizations may also negatively impact sales to other organizations to date we have had limited traction in sales to us government agencies and any future sales to government organizations is uncertain government organizations may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such government organization the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate review and audit government vendors’ administrative and other processes and any unfavorable investigation audit other review or unfavorable determination related to any government clearance of certification could result in the government’s refusing to continue buying our products and services a limitation and reduction of government purchases of our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the investigation audit or other review uncovers improper illegal or otherwise concerning activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way further any refusal to grant certain certifications or clearances by one government agency or decision by one government agency that our products do not meet certain standards may cause reputational harm and cause concern with other government agencies governments and businesses and cause them to not buy our products and services andor lead to a decrease in demand for our products generally finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government and may not successfully obtain all certifications or clearances required for certain us government purchases 

risks related to our industry customers products and services 

we face intense competition in our market and we may not maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and dynamic and we expect competition to continue to intensify we face many competitors across the different cybersecurity markets our competitors include companies such as barracuda check point cisco crowdstrike f5 networks forcepoint imperva juniper mandiant mcafee palo alto networks proofpoint sonicwall sophos trend micro and zscaler 

  

some of our existing and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as 

  

• greater name recognition andor longer operating histories 

  

• larger sales and marketing budgets and resources 

  

• broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and endcustomers 

  

• access to larger customer bases 

  

• greater customer support resources 

  

• greater resources to make acquisitions 

• stronger us government relationships 

  

• lower labor and development costs and 

  

• substantially greater financial technical and other resources 

  

in addition certain of our larger competitors have broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat are often able to deliver these specialized security products to the market more quickly than we can 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services and leverage new business models that are equal or superior to ours achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services disrupt our markets and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do for example certain of our competitors are focusing on delivering security services from the cloud which include cloudbased security providers such as zscaler in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions as a result of such acquisitions competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services as our customers refresh the security products bought in prior years they may seek to consolidate vendors which may result in current customers choosing to purchase products from our competitors on an ongoing basis due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory or components may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex especially given current supply chain disruption our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders or not place orders commensurate with our expectations if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products and accurately forecasting inventory requirements and demand can be challenging our channel partners also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore the time required to source components including chips and other components and manufacture or ship certain products has increased and so we expect inventory shortfalls to continue and costs to manufacture and ship ontime to continue to increase if we cannot manufacture and ship our products due to for example global chip shortages excessive demand on contract manufacturers capacity natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes fires power outages typhoons floods cyber events pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic or manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars and critical infrastructure attacks our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted 

the global chip shortage caused by the covid19 pandemic and other factors affecting manufacturing capacity is having and we expect to continue to have an adverse impact on our ability to manage our inventory and to meet product demand in a timely fashion we expect this shortage will persist for an indefinite period of time management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell which may impact our billings revenue margins and free cash flow mismanagement of our inventory whether due to imprecise forecasting employee errors 

or malfeasance inaccurate information or otherwise may adversely affect our results of operations the covid19 pandemic has resulted in challenges for us to obtain components and inventory as well as increases to freight and shipping costs and may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology product transitions customer requirements or excess inventory levels if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed billings and revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have in the past experienced inventory shortages and excesses due to the variance in demand for certain products from forecasted amounts our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

covid19 pandemic impacts on global supply chains are impacting our ability to procure parts required for our hardware appliances extended lead times have been introduced in delivering products for customer orders in a timely fashion 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to impact global supply chains for many organizations including us resulting in shortages of and delays in both raw materials and electronic components such as computer chips events in upstream supplies and component shortages are negatively impacting our ability to plan and deliver upon orders received in a timely fashion and supply chain disruption component shortages and shipping challenges are increasing our costs these increased costs have resulted in us increasing the prices of our products in turn such price increases may result in our products being less pricecompetitive in the market if our price increases do not offset our increased costs based on covid19 our margins will be negatively impacted 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to acquire and develop internally new products and enhanced versions of our existing products in order to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

• delays in releasing our new products or enhancements to the market 

  

• failure to accurately predict market demand in terms of product functionality and to supply products that meet this demand in a timely fashion 

• failure to have the appropriate research and development expertise and focus to make our top strategic fabric products successful 

  

• failure of our sales force and partners to focus on selling new products 

  

• inability to interoperate effectively with the networks or applications of our prospective endcustomers 

  

• inability to protect against new types of attacks or techniques used by hackers 

  

• actual or perceived defects vulnerabilities errors or failures 

  

• negative publicity about their performance or effectiveness 

  

• introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products by our competitors 

  

• poor business conditions for our endcustomers causing them to delay it purchases 

  

• changes to the regulatory requirements around security and 

  

• reluctance of customers to purchase products incorporating open source software 

  

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

demand for our products may be limited by market perception that individual products from one vendor that provide multiple layers of security protection in one product are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of many of our products depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality into one appliance if the market for these products fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view “allinone” network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that such products of ours provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform our solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of our product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that “allinone” solutions may be suitable only for small and mediumsized businesses because such solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large businesses service provider and government organization endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with our market in general demand for multisecurity functionality products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners including manufacturers with facilities located in taiwan and other countries outside the united states such as adlink ibase microstar senao and wistron our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers reduces our 

control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance costs supply and timing and possible tariffs any manufacturing disruption related to our thirdparty manufacturers or their component suppliers for any reason including global chip shortages natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes fires power outages typhoons floods health pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic and manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption cyber events international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars and critical infrastructure attacks could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed further approximately 83 of our hardware is manufactured in taiwan any increase in tensions between china and taiwan including threats of military actions or escalation of military activities could adversely affect our manufacturing operations in taiwan 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production or shipping interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages quality problems or strike or other labor disruption at one of our manufacturing partners or locations or at shipping ports or locations would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary spus which are key to the performance of our appliances are built by contract manufacturers including renesas and toshiba these contract manufacturers use foundries operated by tsmc or renesas on a purchaseorder basis and these foundries do not guarantee their capacity and could delay orders or increase their pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer inventory shortages of our spu as well as increased costs in addition to our proprietary spu we also purchase offtheshelf asics or integrated circuits from vendors for which we have experienced and may continue to experience long lead times our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes or more profitable products if any of these manufacturers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our spu or asics our business would be harmed 

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances directive the “eu rohs” adopted in the european union the “eu” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals” that are contained in our products have originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank” the securities and exchange commission the “sec” adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to efforts to determine the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements which would make it more difficult to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage cause loss of sales and customers or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers may discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of cpus from intel and advanced micro devices inc “amd” network chips from broadcom marvell and intel and memory devices from intel adata toshiba samsung and western digital we also may face shortages in the supply of the capacitors and resistors that are used in the manufacturing of our products for example the global chip shortage caused by the covid19 pandemic and other factors affecting manufacturing capacity in asia continues to affect the manufacturing capacity of us and our contract manufacturers this shortage may persist for an indefinite period of time the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as global chip shortages natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes fires power outages typhoons floods health pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic and manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars critical infrastructure attacks and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

• a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required parts or components when required 

• financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers 

  

• infringement or misappropriation of our ip 

  

• price increases 

  

• failure of a component to meet environmental or other regulatory requirements 

  

• failure to meet delivery obligations in a timely fashion 

  

• failure in component quality and 

• inability to ship products on a timely basis 

  

the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories 

if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and operating margin and which may adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons or our product mix may change resulting in lower growth and margins based on a number of factors including competitive pricing pressures discounts or promotional programs we offer a change in our mix of products and services and anticipation of the introduction of new products and services competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or services or may bundle them with other products or services additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions have in the past and may in the future negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products or services will decrease over product life cycles we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product and service offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices gross profits and operating margin at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to detect or prevent a security breach or the misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins cause them to fail to help secure our customers or cause our products or services to allow unauthorized access to our customers’ networks additionally any perception that our products have product vulnerabilities whether or not accurate may cause rep utation harm our products are also susceptible to errors defects logic flaws vulnerabilities and inserted vulnerabilities that may arise in or be included in our products in different stages of our supply chain manufacturing and shipment processes and a threat actor’s exploitation of these weaknesses may be difficult to anticipate prevent and detect if we are unable to maintain an effective supply chain security risk management program then the security and integrity of our products and the updates to those products that our customers receive could be exploited by third parties or insiders different customers deploy and use our products in different ways and certain deployments and usages may subject our products to adverse conditions that may negatively impact the effectiveness and useful lifetime of our products our networks and products including cloudbased technology could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation we cannot ensure that our products will prevent all adverse security events because the techniques used by malicious adversaries to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard and other security subscription or forticare updates or our fortinet appliances and operating systems could result in a failure of our fortiguard and other security subscription services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortinet appliances and cloudbased products and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms ransomware attacks or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our data centers and networks and those of our hosting vendors and cloud service providers may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of our customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach or any actual or perceived security risk in our supply chain could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products and services cause customers and customer prospects not to buy from us and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused or misconfigured by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized third party any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

  

• the expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze correct eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities 

  

• the loss of existing or potential endcustomers or channel partners 

  

• delayed or lost revenue 

  

• delay or failure to attain market acceptance 

  

• negative publicity and harm to our reputation and 

  

• litigation regulatory inquiries or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects may be harmed 

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and timeconsuming research and development processes for example we enter into development agreements with third parties if our contract development projects are not successfully completed or are not completed in a timely fashion our product development could be delayed and our business generally could suffer costs for contract development can be substantial and our profitability may be harmed if we are unable to recover these costs although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

moreover business models based on saas cloudbased services have become increasingly indemand by our endcustomers and adopted by other providers including our competitors while we have introduced additional cloudbased products and services and will continue to do so most of our platform is currently deployed on premise and therefore if customers demand that our platform be provided through a saas business model we would be required to make additional investments in our infrastructure and personnel to be able to more fully provide our platform through a saas model in order to maintain the competitiveness of our platform such investments may involve expanding our data centers servers and networks and increasing our technical operations and engineering teams these risks are compounded by the uncertainty concerning the future viability of saas business models and the future demand for such models by customers additionally if we are unable to meet the demand to provide our services through a saas model we may lose customers to competitors 

our uniform resource locator “url” database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’ expectations 

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and 

reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations could impair the growth of our business 

false detection of vulnerabilities viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

our fortiguard and other security subscription services may falsely detect report and act on viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our fortiguard and other security subscription services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures in addition our threat researchers periodically identify vulnerabilities in various thirdparty products and if these identifications are perceived to be incorrect or are in fact incorrect this could harm our business any such false identification or perceived false identification of important files applications or vulnerabilities could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

our ability to sell our products is dependent on our quality control processes and the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer highquality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners and other third parties to resolve any issues relating to our products if we our channel partners or other third parties do not effectively assist our customers in planning deploying and operational proficiency for our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many large endcustomers and service provider or government organization endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers because of their more complex deployments and more demanding environments and business models if we our channel partners or other third parties fail to meet the requirements of our larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with large businesses service providers and government organizations our failure to maintain highquality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to litigation reputational damage loss of customers and additional costs 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance and effectiveness of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us result in litigation and 

disputes with customers and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to litigation litigation costs and liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims if exceptions apply or if the provisions are deemed unenforceable and in some circumstances we may be required to indemnify a customer in full without limitation for certain liabilities including liabilities that are not contractually limited the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us if at all and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

risks related to our systems and technology 

if our internal enterprise it networks on which we conduct internal business and interface externally our operational networks through which we connect to customers vendors and partners systems and provide services or our research and development networks our backend labs and cloud stacks through which we research and develop products and services are compromised public perception of our products and services may be harmed our customers may be breached and harmed we may become subject to liability and our business operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted 

our success depends on the market’s confidence in our ability to provide effective network security protection despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal networks systems and websites we are still vulnerable to computer viruses breakins phishing attacks ransomware attacks attempts to overload our servers with denialofservice vulnerabilities in vendor hardware and software that we leverage advanced persistent threats from sophisticated actors and other cyberattacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our internal networks systems or websites our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance or otherwise which breaches may be more difficult to detect than outsider threats and the existing programs and trainings we have in place to prevent such insider threats may not be effective or sufficient third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to transfer funds or disclose information in order to gain access to our networks and confidential information third parties may also send our customers or others malware or malicious emails that falsely indicate that we are the source potentially causing lost confidence in us and reputational harm we cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to protect our networks systems and websites will provide adequate security moreover because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers and any security breaches and other security incidents involving us may result in more harm to our reputation and brand than companies that do not sell network security solutions hackers and malicious parties may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products and customers that impersonate our update servers in an effort to access customer networks and negatively impact customers or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees customers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our internal networks systems or data 

for example from time to time we have discovered that unauthorized parties have targeted us using sophisticated techniques including by stealing technical data and attempting to steal private encryption keys in an effort to both impersonate our products and threat intelligence update services and possibly attempt other attack methodologies using these techniques these unauthorized parties have tried and may in the future try to gain access to certain of our and our customers’ systems we have also for example discovered that unauthorized parties have targeted vulnerabilities in our product software in an effort to gain entry into our customers’ networks these and other hacking efforts against us and our customers may be ongoing and may recur in the future although we take numerous measures and implement multiple layers of security to protect our networks we cannot guarantee that our security products processes and services will secure against all threats f urther we cannot be sure that third parties have not been or will not in the future be successful in improperly accessing our systems and our customers’ systems which could negatively impact us and our customers an actual breach could significantly harm us and our customers and an actual or perceived breach or any other actual or perceived data security incident threat or vulnerability that involves our supply chains networks systems or websites andor our customers’ supply chains networks systems or websites could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services and investor confidence in our company any breach of our 

networks systems or websites could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide fortiguard forticloud and other security subscription and forticare technical support services to our endcustomers lead to interruptions or system slowdowns cause loss of critical data or lead to the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential proprietary or sensitive information we could also be subject to liability and litigation and reputational harm and our channel partners and endcustomers may be harmed lose confidence in us and decrease or cease using our products and services any breach of our internal networks systems or websites could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and stock price 

in addition due to the covid19 pandemic a substantial majority of our employees are temporarily working remotely which may pose additional data security risks for example there has been an increase in phishing attempts and spam emails as well as social engineering attempts from hackers hoping to use the recent covid19 pandemic to their advantage the risks described above could therefore be exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic 

  

if we do not appropriately manage any future growth including through the expansion of our real estate facilities or are unable to improve our systems processes and controls our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

we rely heavily on information technology to help manage critical functions such as order configuration pricing and quoting revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews in addition we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on manual data entry of customer purchase orders received through email and to a lesser extent through electronic data interchange from our customers due to the use of manual processes and the fact that we may receive a large amount of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter an interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased billings and revenue for that quarter 

to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial operating security and administrative systems and controls and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and processes we must also continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems controls and processes such as system capacity access security and change management controls in a timely or efficient manner our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner whether as a result of the significant growth of our business or otherwise may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses moreover the failure of our systems and processes could undermine our ability to provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results and could impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

in addition our systems processes and controls may not prevent or detect all errors omissions malfeasance or fraud such as corruption and improper “side agreements” that may impact revenue recognition or result in financial liability our productivity and the quality of our products and services may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to ensure appropriate systems processes and controls and to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our reputation and results of operations 

we have expanded our office real estate holdings to meet our projected growing need for office space these plans will require significant capital expenditure over the next several years and involve certain risks including impairment charges and acceleration of depreciation changes in future business strategy that may decrease the need for expansion such as a decrease in headcount or increase in work from home and risks related to construction future changes in growth or fluctuations in cash flow may also negatively impact our ability to pay for these projects or free cash flow additionally inaccuracies in our projected capital expenditures could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

  

we may experience difficulties maintaining and expanding our internal business management systems 

  

the maintenance of our internal business management systems such as our enterprise resource planning “erp” and customer relationship management “crm” systems has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources in addition we may choose to upgrade or expand the functionality of our internal systems leading to additional costs we may also discover deficiencies in our design or maintenance of our internal systems that could adversely affect our ability to forecast orders process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations accurately maintain books and records provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business additionally if any of our internal 

systems does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed further we may expand the scope of our erp and crm systems our operating results may be adversely affected if these upgrades or expansions are delayed or if the systems do not function as intended or are not sufficient to meet our operating requirements 

risks related to our intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce and we may be subject to claims by others that we infringe their propriety technology 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from time to time legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other ip rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license the gnu lesser public license the bsd license the apache license the mit x license and the mozilla public license from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ ip rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of ip rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as for example open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that for example could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products 

if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which requirements could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other ip disputes are common in the network security industry third parties are currently asserting have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of ip rights against us third parties have also asserted such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we may indemnify against claims that our products infringe the ip rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies nonpracticing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes as well as general commercial litigation and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion in december 2021 we entered into an agreement that provided for settlement and dismissal of an existing patent infringement lawsuit and a mutual covenantnottosue for a defined duration of time please refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we have several ongoing patent lawsuits certain companies have sent us demand letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and organizations have sent letters demanding that we provide indemnification for patent claims given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities and recent nonpracticing entity and operating entity patent litigation against other companies in the security space we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any settlement payment or adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products include software or other ip licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products licensors may claim we owe them additional license fees for past and future use of their software and other ip or that we cannot utilize such software or ip in our products going forward there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or for reasonable pricing or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may result in significant license fees and have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other ip licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

we also rely on technologies licensed from third parties in order to operate functions of our business if any of these third parties allege that we have not properly paid for such licenses or that we have improperly used the technologies under 

such licenses we may need to pay additional fees or obtain new licenses and such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all or may be costly in any such case or if we were required to redesign our internal operations to function with new technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

other risks related to our business and financial position 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies or to successfully invest in and form successful strategic alliances with other businesses could seriously harm our competitive position 

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products technologies or ip such as patents and to make equity investments in businesses coupled with strategic alliances for example in 2021 we acquired shieldx and alaxala and we made an equity investment in linksys holdings inc “linksys” f or any possible future acquisitions or investments we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition or investment or financing the acquisition or investment for both our prior and future acquisitions we may not be successful in effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or ip and sales force into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies ip or products with our existing product lines integrating reporting systems and procedures and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies for example we may experience difficulties integrating an acquired company’s erp or crm systems sales support and other processes and systems with our current systems and processes the results of certain businesses that we invest in such as linksys are or may in the future be reflected in our operating results and we depend on these companies to provide us financial information in a timely manner in order to meet our financial reporting requirements we may experience difficulty in timely obtaining financial information from the companies in which we have invested in order to meet our financial reporting requirements our due diligence for acquisitions and investments may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with ip product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices environmental and sustainability compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or an investment and alliance in addition any acquisitions and significant investments we are able to complete may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in negative impact to our operating results and impairment charges that could be substantial we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders acquisitions or investments during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our cash flows or our results of operations for that period and future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition or investment and alliance and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or ip are challenging to do successfully and could significantly divert management time and resources 

in addition because we are accounting for our linksys investment using the equity method of accounting we are reliant on the accuracy and timeliness of their financial reporting to us if their financial reporting to us is not accurate and timely it may result in delays in our financial reporting 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose endcustomers in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state regional local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety product labeling environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws data privacy laws import and export controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations sanctions enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

for example the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 and superseded current eu data protection regulations imposes stringent data handling requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the eu noncompliance with the gdpr could result in significant penalties including data protection audits and heavy fines compliance with and the other burdens imposed by the gdpr may limit our ability to operate or expand our business in europe and could adversely impact our operating results as could delays or shortcomings in the implementation of our gdpr compliance program in july 2020 the european court of justice issued a judgment declaring invalid the euus privacy shield framework the “privacy shield” as a mechanism for exportation of personal data from the european economic area to the 

united states though we are not participants of the privacy shield and instead employ alternative mechanisms for personal data transfers the ruling raises questions as to gdpr implications and adequate data protection in the united states and may have an impact on our european customers and related business operations 

additionally we may be subject to other legal regimes throughout the world governing data handling protection and privacy for example in june 2018 california passed the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies and became effective on january 1 2020 the ccpa was expanded pursuant to the california privacy rights act which was passed in 2020 and which will become effective in 2023 the costs of compliance with and the penalties for violations of the gdpr and ccpa along with other burdens imposed by these regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business 

selling our solutions to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements government permit and clearance requirements and other risks failure to comply with these requirements or to obtain and maintain government permits and clearances required to do certain business by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines suspension limitations on business or debarment from doing business with the us government or one of its divisions as well as other penalties damages and reputational harms which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and prospects any violations of regulatory and contractual requirements could result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our revenue operating results financial condition and prospects 

these laws regulations and other requirements impose added costs on our business and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements including noncompliance in the past could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners penalties termination of contracts loss of exclusive rights in our ip and temporary suspension permanent debarment from government contracting or other limitations on doing business any such damages penalties disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales and that could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the united states only with the required export license or through an export license exception or may be prohibited altogether from export to certain countries if we were to fail to comply with us export laws us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits eg for stocking orders placed by our partners we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements to change tax provisions related to global manufacturing and sales or to impose new tariffs economic sanctions or related legislation any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business benefits directly and indirectly from free trade agreements and we also rely on various us corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we develop market and sell our products and services globally efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements or to change corporate tax policy related to international commerce could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as could the continuing uncertainty regarding whether such actions will be taken 

moreover efforts to implement changes related to export or import regulations including the imposition of new border taxes or tariffs on foreign imports trade barriers economic sanctions and other related policies could harm our results of operations for example in recent years the united states has imposed additional import tariffs on certain goods from different countries and on most of chinese imported goods as a result china and other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods exported from the united states and both the united states and foreign countries have threatened to alter or leave current trade agreements while we do not currently expect these tariffs to have a significant effect on our raw material and product import costs if the united states expands increased tariffs or retaliatory trade measures are taken by other countries in response to the tariffs the cost of our products could increase our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to raise our prices which may result in the loss of customers and harm to our reputation and operating performance 

any modification in these areas any shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or any change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential endcustomers with international operations and could result in increased costs any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products laws relating to our real property and future expansion plans and laws concerning the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment “eee” the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs directive eu regulation 19072006 – registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals the “reach” regulation and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations these legal and regulatory regimes including the laws rules and regulations thereunder evolve frequently and may be modified interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with one another moreover the timing and effect of these laws and regulations on our business may be uncertain to the extent we have not complied with such laws rules and regulations we could be subject to significant fines revocation of licenses limitations on our products and services reputational harm and other regulatory consequences each of which may be significant and could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition these laws and regulations may also impact our suppliers which could have among other things have an adverse impact on the costs of components in our products 

the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban or restrict the presence of certain hazardous substances such as lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium and certain fireretardant plastic additives in electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off scrapped noncompliant inventory we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on exemptions for lead and other substances in network infrastructure equipment it is possible one or more of these use exemptions will be revoked in the future additionally although some of the eu rohs exemptions have been extended it is possible that some of these exemptions may expire in the future without being extended if this exemption is revoked or expires without extension if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us andor disrupt our operations or logistics 

as part of the circular economy action plan the european commission amended the eu waste framework directive “wfd” to include a number of measures related to waste prevention and recycling whereby we are responsible for 

submitting product data to a substances of concern in articles as such or in complex objects products “scip” database containing information on substances of very high concern “svhc” in articles and in complex objects the scip database is established under the wfd and managed by the european chemicals agency “echa” we expect to incur costs in order to comply with this new requirement 

the eu’s weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in decreased demand for our products and services resulting in reduced sales of our products increased demand for competitive products and services that result in lower emissions than our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions any of which could harm our business and financial condition to date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our operating results or cash flows and although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs new laws may result in increased penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

investors’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

there is an increasing focus from certain investors employees customers and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility specifically related to esg matters some investors may use these nonfinancial performance factors to guide their investment strategies and in some cases may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to corporate responsibility are inadequate the growing investor demand for measurement of nonfinancial performance is addressed by thirdparty providers of sustainability assessment and ratings on companies the criteria by which our corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change due to the constant evolution of the sustainability landscape which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria if we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria investors may conclude that our policies andor actions with respect to corporate social responsibility are inadequate we may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the esg standards set by various constituencies 

furthermore in the event that we communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding esg matters such as our commitment to target carbon neutrality we could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or goals or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors customers employees and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned our reputation and business operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

risks related to finance accounting and tax matters 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition deferred contract costs and commission expense valuation of inventory accounting for business combination contingent liabilities and accounting for income taxes 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro canadian dollar and british pound additionally fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar may negatively impact our development plans in burnaby canada while we are not currently engaged in material hedging activities we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts through the use of forward exchange contracts if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currencydenominated operating expenses in addition a strengthening of the us dollar may increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of our subsidiaries are organized our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control these include 

• the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or withholding taxes 

• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

• transfer pricing adjustments 

• increases to corporate tax rates 

• an increase in nondeductible expenses for tax purposes including certain stockbased compensation expense 

• changes in availability of tax credits andor tax deductions 

• tax costs related to intercompany realignments 

• tax assessments resulting from income tax audits or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our provision for income taxes for the period in which the settlement takes place and 

• changes in accounting principles court decisions tax rulings and interpretations of or changes to tax laws and regulations by international federal or local governmental authorities 

we have open tax years that could be subject to the examination by the internal revenue service the “irs” and other tax authorities we currently have ongoing tax audits in the united kingdom canada germany and several other foreign jurisdictions the focus of all of these audits is the allocation of profits among our legal entities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results 

we may undertake corporate operating restructurings or transfers of assets that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad in order to maximize the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure if ineffectual such restructurings or transfers could increase our income tax liabilities and in turn increase our global effective tax rate moreover our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner that we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws however the tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of 

future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or our effective tax rate in a given jurisdiction differs from our estimate our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations additionally our actual tax rate may be subject to further uncertainty due to potential changes in us and foreign tax rules 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently tax authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” an international association comprised of 38 countries including the united states has issued and continues to issue guidelines and proposals that change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business due to our extensive international business activities any changes in the taxation of such activities could increase our tax obligations in many countries and may increase our worldwide effective tax rate 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sarbanesoxley” doddfrank and other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these requirements as well as proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations sarbanesoxley requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly although our most recent assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2021 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2022 or future periods and there can be no assurance that in the future our internal controls over financial reporting will be effective or deemed effective we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile which may be exacerbated by share repurchases under our share repurchase program 

  

the market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report news about us and our financial results the impact of the covid19 pandemic news about our competitors and their results and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us for example during 2021 the closing price of our common stock ranged from 13811 to 36767 per share 

furthermore stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business in addition the market price of our common stock and the market price of the common stock of many other companies have fallen significantly since the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may impact the market price of our common stock is unclear and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

share repurchases under the repurchase program could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock could diminish our cash reserves could occur at nonoptimal prices and may not result in the most effective use of our capital 

in october 2021 our board of directors approved a 125 billion increase in the authorized stock repurchase amount under the repurchase program and extended the term of the repurchase program to february 28 2023 bringing the aggregate amount authorized to be repurchased to 425 billion as of december 31 2021 152 billion remained available for future share repurchases under the repurchase program share repurchases under the repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock increase stock price volatility and diminish our cash reserves in addition an announcement of the reduction suspension or termination of the repurchase program could result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock moreover our stock price could decline resulting in repurchases made at nonoptimal prices our failure to repurchase our stock at optimal prices may be perceived by investors as an inefficient use of our cash and cash equivalents which could result in litigation that may have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition while our board of directors carefully considers various alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents in determining whether to authorize stock repurchases there can be no assurance that the decision by our board of directors to repurchase stock would result in the most effective uses of our cash and cash equivalents and there may be alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents that would be more effective such as investing in growing our business organically or through acquisitions 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

• authorizing “blank check” preferred stock which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock 

  

• limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers 

  

• requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors 

• providing that certain litigation matters may only be brought against us in state or federal courts in the state of delaware 

  

• controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings and 

  

• providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings 

  

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

in addition our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum to the fullest extent permitted by law the federal district courts of the united states shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act of 1933 as amended any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision this provision as well as provisions providing that certain litigation matters may only be brought against us in state or federal courts in the state of delaware may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

however these antitakeover provisions will not have the effect of preventing activist stockholders from seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as nominating board candidates and requesting that we pursue strategic combinations or other transactions these actions could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of activist stockholder actions could result in the loss of potential business opportunities as well as other negative business consequences actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect our business further we may incur significant expenses in retaining professionals to advise and assist us on activist stockholder matters including legal financial communications advisors and solicitation experts which may negatively impact our future financial results 

general risks 

global economic uncertainty and weakening product demand caused by political instability changes in trade agreements and conflicts such as the conflict between russia and ukraine could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

economic uncertainty in various global markets caused by political instability and conflict and economic challenges caused by the covid19 pandemic has resulted and may continue to result in weakened demand for our products and services and difficulty in forecasting our financial results and managing inventory levels political developments impacting government spending and international trade including potential government shutdowns and trade disputes and tariffs may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions the effects of these events may continue due to potential us government shutdowns and the transition in administrations and the united states’ ongoing trade disputes with china and other countries the continuing effect of any or all of these events could adversely impact demand for our products harm our operations and weaken our financial results 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes drought fire power outages typhoon floods virus outbreaks and other broad healthrelated challenges cyber events and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest labor disruption critical infrastructure attack and terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake drought fire power outage flood viral outbreak or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our 

corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity and our research and development and data center in burnaby canada from which we deliver to customers our fortiguard and other security subscription updates is subject to the risk of flooding and is also in a region known for seismic activity any earthquake in the bay area or burnaby or flooding in burnaby could materially negatively impact our ability to provide products and services such as forticare support and fortiguard subscription services and could otherwise materially negatively impact our business in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products or performing or assisting with shipments on a timely basis as well as our customers’ ability to order from us and our employees’ ability to perform their duties for example a typhoon in taiwan could materially negatively impact our ability to ship products and could result in delays and reductions in billings and revenues and the covid19 pandemic will negatively impact our ability to manufacture and ship products possibly in a material way and could result in delays and reductions in billings and revenues also possibly in a material way the impact of climate change could affect economies in ways that negatively impact us and our results of operations in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in our missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability international disputes wars and other acts of aggression civil and political unrest labor disruptions rebellions acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers suppliers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or of the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at the end of each quarter any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results to the extent that any of the above results in security risks to our customers delays or cancellations of customer orders the delay of the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products or interruption or downtime of our services our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing or new accounting pronouncements as well as significant costs incurred or that may be incurred to adopt and to comply with these new pronouncements could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which could have an adverse effect on our business our ability to meet our reporting obligations and compliance with internal control requirements 

management will continue to make judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of new standards if our circumstances change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock further marketable equity investments are required to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income which may increase the volatility of our earnings

our revenue growth was driven by both product and service revenue on a geographic basis revenue continues to be diversified globally which remains a key strength of our business in 2021 the americas region the europe middle east and africa “emea” region and the asia pacific “apac” region contributed 41 38 and 21 of our total revenue respectively and increased by 26 29 and 35 compared to 2020 respectively 

product revenue grew 37 in 2021 product revenue growth was consistent with an elevated cyber threat landscape fortigate products accounted for more than half of the product revenue growth in 2021 while secure sdwan contributed to product revenue growth the main driver was the strong demand for the wide range of other operating system capabilities embedded in the fortigate products we experienced strong product revenue growth across many of our security fabric platform products including our ot solutions secure access products and software licenses the impact of the increase in backlog was largely seen in certain fabric platform products service revenue growth of 24 in 2021 was driven by the strength 

of our fortiguard and other security subscription revenue and fortigate technical support and other service revenue which grew 22 and 27 respectively in 2021

covid19 pandemic update 

the united states and the global community we serve are facing unprecedented challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic including the various covid19 variants in response to the pandemic we undertook a number of actions to protect our employees including restricting travel and directing many of our employees to work from home in certain geographies we have started to transition back to an inperson working mode allowing increasing numbers of employees to work from our offices with reasonable precautions and in all cases subject to abiding by local legal restrictions we intend to continue to monitor and abide by local employee health and safety protocols and other regulations as applicable to each local office 

while the broader implications of the covid19 pandemic on our employees and overall financial performance continue to evolve we have seen certain impacts on our business and operations results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and capital and financial resources as of and during the year ended december 31 2021 conversely some aspects of our business do not appear to have been significantly affected during the year ended december 31 2021 we have observed the following 

• we have seen supply chain challenges increase including chip and other component shortages and increased costs for certain chips and other components and shipping and we do not have enough inventory to promptly meet all demand for all products 

• in most countries our employees’ ability to travel has been reduced inperson sales and marketing events or meetings that would normally have been held were canceled postponed or converted into virtual events however as certain country’s restrictions start to ease we have started to see an increase in expenses related to travel and marketing events although we cannot predict if or when such expenses will return to prepandemic levels as of december 31 2021 we have started to see an increase in such expenses as compared to the same peri od last year 

• in order to mitigate supply chain disruption and other supply chain risks and in anticipation of future demand we worked to increase our onhand stock of certain products we increased our commitments with certain suppliers to secure capacity and are meeting regularly with our contract manufacturers and component suppliers to manage future commitments address component shortages and monitor delivery of finished goods we have also transitioned primarily to air shipping to avoid port congestion and extended ocean freight time 

• in accordance with the cares act we have deferred the deposit and payment of our employer’s share of social security taxes this did not materially affect net cash provided by operating activities during the period 

going forward the situation remains uncertain rapidly changing and hard to predict and the covid19 pandemic may have a material negative impact on our future periods if we experience greater component shipping or inventory challenges than we expect or significant changes in our billings growth rates it will negatively impact billings and product revenue in the current quarter and fortiguard and forticare service revenues in subsequent quarters as we sell annual and multiyear service contracts that are recognized ratably over the contractual service term in addition the broader implications of the pandemic on our business and operations and our financial results including the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will impact future results and growth in the cybersecurity industry remain uncertain the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on ongoing developments including the duration and spread of the virus and its variants the impact on our endcustomers’ spending the volume of sales and length of our sales cycles the impact on our partners suppliers and employees actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and other factors identified in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this form 10k given the dynamic nature of these circumstances the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and operations results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and capital and financial resources cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

business model 

we typically sell our security solutions to distributors that sell to networking security focused resellers and to service providers and managed security service providers “mssps” who in turn sell to endcustomers or use our products and services to provided hosted solutions to other enterprises at times we also sell directly to large service providers and major systems integrators our endcustomers are located in over 100 countries and include small medium and large enterprises and government organizations across a wide range of industries including telecommunications government financial services retail technology education manufacturing and healthcare an endcustomer deployment may involve as few as one or as many as thousands of appliances and other fortinet security fabric cybersecurity mesh platform products depending on the endcustomer’s size and security requirements 

we also offer our products hosted in our own data centers and through major cloud providers and have recognized revenue on a usage basis from alibaba cloud amazon web services google cloud ibm cloud microsoft azure and oracle cloud we have also recognized revenue from customers who deploy our products in a bringyourownlicense “byol” arrangement in private clouds or at cloud providers in a byol arrangement a customer purchases a software license from us through our channel partners and deploys the software in a cloud provider’s environment similarly customers may purchase such a license from us and deploy in thirdparty clouds or in their private cloud 

our customers purchase our hardware products and software licenses as well as our fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services we generally invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and security and technical support services standard payment terms are generally no more than 60 days though we continue to offer extended payment terms to certain distributors 

key metrics 

we monitor a number of key metrics including the key financial metrics set forth below in order to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies the following table summarizes revenue deferred revenue billings nongaap net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow nongaap we discuss revenue below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss net cash provided by operating activities below under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue billings nongaap and free cash flow nongaap are discussed immediately below the following table 



deferred revenue our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unrecognized portion of service revenue from fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual service period we monitor our deferred revenue balance deferred revenue growth and the mix of shortterm and longterm deferred revenue because deferred revenue represents a significant portion of free cash flow and of revenue to be recognized in future periods deferred revenue was 345 billion as of december 31 2021 an increase of 8476 million or 33 from december 31 2020  

billings nongaap we define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations and an adjustment due to adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 202108 during the period we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive current and future revenue which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business there are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of gaap revenue first billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue and are impacted by the term of fortiguard security and forticare support agreements second we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding gaap revenue and evaluating billings together with gaap revenue total billings were 418 billion for 2021 an increase of 35 compared to 309 billion in 2020 

a reconciliation of revenue the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to billings is provided below 



free cash flow nongaap we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment and excluding any significant nonrecurring items we believe free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after capital expenditures can be used for strategic opportunities including repurchasing outstanding common stock investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet a limitation of using free cash flow rather than the gaap measures of cash provided by or used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance for the period because it excludes cash flows from investing activities other than capital expenditures and cash flows from financing activities management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the consolidated statements of cash flows and under “—liquidity and capital resources” and by presenting cash flows from investing and financing activities in our reconciliation of free cash flow in addition it is important to note that other companies including companies in our industry may not use free cash flow may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to free cash flow is provided below 



components of operating results 

revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our hardware and software products and amortization of amounts included in deferred revenue related to previous sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services we also recognize revenue from cloud security solutions professional services and training 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

• product revenue  product revenue is primarily generated from sales of our physical and virtual machine appliances the majority of our product revenue continues to be generated by our fortigate product line product revenue also includes revenue derived from sales of fabric appliance and software products as a percentage of total revenue our product revenue has varied from quarter to quarter 

• service revenue  service revenue is generated primarily from fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services we recognize revenue from fortiguard security subscription and 

forticare technical support services over the contractual service period our typical contractual support and subscription term is one to five years we also generate a small portion of our revenue from other services for which we recognize revenue as the services are provided and cloudbased services for which we recognize revenue as the services are delivered or on a monthly usage basis as a percentage of total revenue we continue to expect service revenue to be higher than product revenue our service revenue growth rate depends significantly on the growth of our customer base the expansion of our service bundle offerings the expansion and introduction of new service offerings the attach rate of service contracts to new product sales and the renewal of service contracts by our existing customers 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

• cost of product revenue  the majority of the cost of product revenue consists of thirdparty contract manufacturers’ costs and the costs of materials used in production our cost of product revenue also includes supplies shipping costs personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control facilityrelated costs excess and obsolete inventory costs warranty costs and amortization of intangible assets personnel costs include direct compensation benefits and stock based compensation 

• cost of service revenue  cost of service revenue is primarily comprised of personnel costs thirdparty repair and contract fulfillment data center costs colocation expenses and cloud hosting supplies and facilityrelated costs 

gross margin  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products product costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between hardware products software licenses and services and any excess inventory writeoffs service revenue and software licenses have had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher gross margins compared to hardware product gross margins during 2021 product gross margin benefited from gains in average selling price as well as lower direct and indirect product costs as a percentage of product revenue it also benefited from product mix software revenue growth and a stable product transition environment service gross margin benefited from renewals and continued sales of services and subscriptions growing faster than related expenses overall gross margin in 2022 will be impacted by service and product revenue mix 

operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries benefits bonuses sales commission and stockbased compensation we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our workforce 

• research and development  research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs additional research and development expenses include asic and system prototypes and certificationrelated expenses depreciation of property and equipment and facilityrelated expenses the majority of our research and development is focused on software development and the ongoing development of our hardware products we record research and development expenses as incurred as of december 31 2021 approximately 88 of our research and development teams were located in canada the united states and india 

• sales and marketing  sales and marketing expense is the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consists of personnel costs additional sales and marketing expenses include product marketing public relations field marketing and channel marketing programs eg partner cooperative marketing arrangements as well as travel depreciation of property and equipment and facilityrelated expenses we intend to hire additional personnel focused on sales and marketing and expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide in order to capture market share 

• general and administrative  general and administrative expense consists of personnel costs as well as professional fees depreciation of property and equipment and software and facilityrelated expenses general and administrative personnel include our executive finance human resources information technology and legal organizations our professional fees principally consist of outside legal auditing tax information technology and other consulting costs 

• gain on intellectual property matter gain on intellectual property matter consists of the amortization of the deferred component of an agreement with a competitor in the network security industry whereby the 

competitor party paid us a lump sum of 500 million for a sevenyear mutual covenantnottosue for patent claims 

interest income—net interest income—net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash equivalents and investments historically our investments include corporate debt securities certificates of deposit and term deposits commercial paper money market funds and us government and agency securities 

other expense — net  other expense—net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses due to the changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities as well as the gain on the sale or the impairment charges of our investments in privately held companies 

provision for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in local countries and may be subject to us income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than in the us nondeductible stockbased compensation expense federal research and development tax credit state taxes withholding taxes excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense and the tax impacts of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” including the foreignderived intangible income “fdii” deduction 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of the significant accounting policies described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

revenues are recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services 

we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 

• identification of a contract or contracts with a customer 

• identification of the performance obligations in a contract including evaluation of performance obligations as to being distinct goods or services in a contract 

• determination of a transaction price 

• allocation of a transaction price to the performance obligations in a contract and 

• recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation 

our sales contracts typically contain multiple deliverables such as hardware software license security subscription technical support services and other services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations our hardware and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities accordingly the hardware and software licenses are distinct from the security subscription and technical support services as a customer can benefit from the product without the services and the services are separately identifiable within a contract we allocate a transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price we establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately if not observable through past transactions we determine standalone selling price by considering multiple historical factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies and the term of a service contract 

deferred contract costs and commission expense 

we defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts contract costs which primarily consist of sales commissions are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates costs for initial contracts that are not commensurate with commissions on renewal contracts are amortized on a straightline basis over the period of benefit of five years estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for deferred contract costs include but are not limited to identification of contract costs anticipated billings and the expected period of benefit 

business combinations 

we include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill we often continue to gather additional information throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded such changes are recorded in the period in which they are identified 

contingent liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in disputes litigation and other legal actions however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other thirdparty claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations we periodically review significant claims and litigation matters for the probability of an adverse outcome we accrue for a loss contingency if a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these accruals are generally based on a range of possible outcomes that require significant judgement estimates can change as individual claims develop the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in addition deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of income become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets would be recorded in the consolidated statements of income for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of the position that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we have elected to account for global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” which was introduced in the 2017 tax act as a current period expense 

investments in privately held companies 

our investments in privately held companies primarily consist of investments in common stock or insubstance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee but not an absolute controlling financial interest and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting determining that we do not control but exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee requires significant judgement when considering many factors including but not limited to the ownership interest in the investee board representation participation in policymaking processes and participation rights in certain significant financial and operating decisions of the investee in the ordinary course of business our investment in linksys is our only equity method investment we record our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of linksys based on the most recently available financial statements of linksys which are provided to us on a threemonth lag and our share of the amortization of any basis differences in gain or loss from equity method investment in our consolidated statements of income 

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 





discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 as compared to 2019 can be found in item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 filed with the sec on february 19 2021 

2021 and 2020 

revenue 



total revenue increased by 7478 million or 29 in 2021 compared to 2020 we continued to experience diversification of revenue globally and across both customer and industry segments revenue from all regions grew with emea contributing the largest portion of the increase on an absolute dollar basis and apac which included alaxala contributing the fastest growth on a percentage basis 

product revenue increased by 3386 million or 37 in 2021 compared to 2020 we experienced revenue growth across many of our products due to an increase in product revenue from our fortigate products and security fabric platform products including our sdwan solutions and software licenses 

service revenue increased by 4092 million or 24 in 2021 compared to 2020 fortiguard security subscription forticare technical support and other revenues increased by 2063 million or 22 and 2029 million or 27 respectively in 2021 compared to 2020 the increases were primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance related to fortiguard and other security subscriptions and forticare technical support including our customers moving to highertier support offerings as well as growth from our service bundles and professional services 

of the service revenue recognized in 2021 65 was included in the deferred revenue balance as of december 31 2020 of the service revenue recognized in 2020 68 was included in the deferred revenue balance as of december 31 2019 

cost of revenue and gross margin 



total gross margin decreased by 14 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by shift in the revenue mix to lower margin product revenue from higher margin service revenue as a percentage of total revenue the revenue mix shifted by 23 percentage points to product revenue from service revenue 

product gross margin decreased by 04 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by higher component costs related to supply constraints higher freight costs and the impact of alaxala’s product gross margin  cost of product revenue was comprised primarily of thirdparty contract manufacturers’ costs and the costs of materials used in production 

service gross margin decreased by 11 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020 cost of service revenue was comprised primarily of personnel costs thirdparty repair and contract fulfillment data center costs colocation expenses and cloud hosting supplies and facilityrelated costs the decrease in service gross margin was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuation increased costs associated with an expansion in our data centers and the impact of alaxala’s service gross margin  

operating expenses 



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 828 million or 24 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs o f 695 mill ion as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements to our existing products and foreign currency fluctuations in addition we incurred increases in depreciation and other occupancy costs of 84 million and third party product development costs of 83 million such as thirdparty testing and prototypes partially offset by a decrease in other costs of 36 million we currently intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization and expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2022 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 2738 million or 26 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 2137 million as a result of increases to sales and marketing headcount in order to drive global market revenue increases and foreign currency fluctuations marketing related expenses increased 329 million and included expenses related to our sponsorship of the fortinet championship a professional golfers’ association tour event that we sponsored in september 2021 in addition we incurred increases in depreciation and other occupancy expense of 94 million marketing supplies expense of 58 million and travel expense of 52 million we currently intend to continue to make investments in sales and marketing resources which are critical to support our future growth and expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2022

gain on ip matter 

in january 2020 we entered into an agreement with a competitor in the network security industry whereby in february 2020 the competitor party paid us a lump sum of 500 million for a mutual covenantnottosue for patent claims of this amount we recorded a 46 million gain on intellectual property matter in our consolidated statements of income in 2021 compared to 402 million in 2020 refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the gain on ip matter 

operating income and margin 

we generated operating income of 6504 million in 2021 an increase of 1186 million or 22 compared to 5318 million in 2020 operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to 19 in 2021 compared to 20 in 2020 we recorded a 46 million gain on intellectual property matter in our consolidated statements of income in 2021 compared to a 402 million gain in 2020 which increased our operating margin by 15 percentage points in 2020 excluding the impact of these gains our operating margin increased 04 percentage points primarily due to 10 percentage point 05 percentage point and 03 percentage point decreases in sales and marketing expense research and development expense and general and administrative expense as percentage of revenue respectively partially offset by a decrease in gross margin largely driven by the mix shift from service revenue to product revenue 

interest income interest expense and other expense — net 



 not meaningful 

interest income decreased by 132 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily as a result of lower interest rates interest income varies depending on our average investment balances during the period types and mix of investments and market interest rates interest expense increased by 149 million due to the senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2021 other expense—net increase by 38 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily the re sult of an increase of 51 million in losses on marketable equity securities and an increase of 27 million in foreign exchange losses in 2021 compared to 2020 in 2020 we recognized a 43 million impairment charge on an investment in a privately held company and there were no such impairment charges in 2021 

provision for income taxes 



our provision for income taxes for 2021 reflects an effective tax rate of 2 compared to an effective tax rate of 10 for 2020 the provision for income taxes for 2021 w as comprised primarily of a 1408 million tax expense related to us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes and unrecognized tax benefits the provision was partially offset by excess tax benefits of 820 million from stockbased compensation expense a tax benefit of 336 million from the fdii deduction and tax benefits of 111 million from federal research and development tax credits 

our provision for income taxes for 2020 reflects an effective tax rate of 10 compared to an effective tax rate of 14 for 2019 the provision for income taxes for 2020 was comprised primarily of a 1468 million tax expense related to us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes and unrecognized tax benefits the provision was partially offset by a tax benefit of 443 million from the fdii deduction excess tax benefits of 420 million from stockbased compensation expense and tax benefits of 75 million from federal research and development tax credits 

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend which has positively impacted billings and product revenue activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential customer product buying followed by an increase in buying in the second and third quarters although these seasonal factors may be common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

consistent with the seasonality note above our total quarterly revenue over the past two years has increased sequentially each year product revenue increased yearoveryear as compared to 2020 as we have continued product innovation and launched new product models expanded our solution sales including sdwan and wfa solutions and increased our investments in our sales and marketing organizations 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to the relative product and service mix as well as the timing of supplier cost increases and our own price increases product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold their cost profile and their average selling prices in 2021 product gross margin was impacted by new product introductions the mix of highend midrange and entrylevel fortigate products and the mix of other fabric products software sales and the timing and impact of supplier cost increases and our own price list increases in 2021 we experienced an unusual level of component suppliers charging new expedite fees and increases in freight costs historically we have been able to improve our direct cost of appliances and our product gross margin service gross margin is impacted by revenue growth and our personnelrelated costs thirdparty repair and contract fulfillment data center colocation fees cloud hosting supplies facilityrelated costs and foreign currency fluctuations 

liquidity and capital resources 



liquidity and capital resources are impacted by our operating activities proceeds from issuance of our investment grade debt and from exercise of stock options issued to employees as well as cash used on stock repurchases real estate purchases and other capital expenditures investments in various companies and business acquisitions 

in recent years we have received significant capital resources from our billings to customers issuance of investment grade debt and to some extent from the exercise of stock options by our employees additional increases in billings may depend on a number of factors including demand for our products and services competition market or industry changes macroeconomic events such as the covid19 pandemic supply chain capacity and disruptions international conflicts and our ability to execute we expect proceeds from the exercise of stock options in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units versus stock options granted to our employees and to vary based on our share price 

in october 2021 our board of directors authorized a 125 billion increase in the authorized stock repurchase under the repurchase program and extended the term of the repurchase program to february 28 2023 bringing the aggregate amount of authorized to be repurchased to 425 billion in 2021 we repurchased 26 million shares of common stock under the repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of 7418 million as of december 31 2021 152 billion remained available for future share repurchases under the repurchase program 

in march 2021 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 10 notes due march 15 2026 and 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 22 notes due march 15 2031 in an underwritten registered public offering the “notes” we do not currently intend to retire these notes early refer to note 11 debt in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for information on the notes 

in february 2020 we received a cash payment of 500 million pursuant to a mutual covenantnottosue and release agreement with a competitor in the network security industry 

in 2021 we completed our new netzero building on our sunnyvale headquarters campus we expect to continue to increase our office and warehouse capacity to support growth as we purchase new properties we will work to incorporate these properties into the environmental goals we have established we estimate 2022 capital expenditures to be between 270 million and 300 million 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under our notes inventory purchase and other contractual commitments as of december 31 2021 the longterm debt net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs was 9884 million in addition we enter into noncancellable agreements with contract manufacturers to procure inventory based on our requirements in order to reduce manufacturing lead times plan for adequate component supply or incentivize suppliers to deliver in 2021 we significantly increased these commitments as contract manufacturers and component suppliers significantly increased their pricing and lead times inventory purchase commitments as of december 31 2021 were 114 billion an increase of 8811 million compared to 2594 million as of december 31 2020 we estimate payments of 108 billion due on or before december 31 2022 related to these commitments we also have open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services as of december 31 2021 we had 1267 million in other contractual commitments having a remaining term in excess of one year that are noncancelable 

as of december 31 2021 our cash cash equivalents investments and marketable equity securities of 299 billion were invested primarily in deposit accounts commercial paper corporate debt securities us government and agency securities certificates of deposit and term deposits money market funds municipal bonds and marketable equity securities it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital provides liquidity and generates return without significantly increasing risk we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments held by our international subsidiaries was 1324 million and 1198 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet our requirements and plans for cash including meeting our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements in the long term our ability to support our requirements and plans for cash including our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and amount of our share repurchases the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the continuing market acceptance of our products the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts our investments in purchasing or leasing real estate and macroeconomic impacts such as the covid19 pandemic historically we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisition activities in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 

during 2021 2020 and 2019 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

operating activities 

cash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity it is primarily comprised of net income as adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash adjustments consist primarily of stockbased compensation amortization of deferred contract costs and depreciation and amortization changes in operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of changes in deferred revenue deferred contract costs deferred tax assets and accounts receivable 

our operating activities during 2021 provided cash flows of 150 billion as a result of the continued growth of our business and our ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard and other security subscription services and forticare technical support services to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue our total deferred revenue balance grew 8476 million or 33 during 2021 

investing activities 

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments purchases of property and equipment investments in various companies and business acquisitions historically in making a lease versus ownership decision related to our larger facilities we have considered various factors including financial metrics and the impact on our engineers and other employees and expected longterm growth rates in certain cases we have elected to own the facility if we believed that purchasing building or developing buildings rather than leasing is more in line with our longterm strategy we may make similar decisions in the future we may also make cash payments in connection with future business combinations 

during 2021 cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by 7522 million spent for purchases of investments net of maturities and sales of investments 2959 million of purchases of property and equipment a large portion of which relates to our headquarters building construction 1600 million used for purchases of investment in a privately held company and 749 million used for the acquisitions of alaxala shieldx and other net of cash and 425 million used for purchases of marketable equity securities 

financing activities 

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to the issuance of the notes repurchase and retirement of common stock and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the 2009 plan 

during 2021 cash provided by financing activities was 828 million primarily driven by 9870 million in cash proceeds from longterm investment grade debt net of discount and underwriting fees partially offset by 7418 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock and 1419 million used to pay tax withholding net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

investment and interest rate fluctuation risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risks related to our investment portfolio and outstanding debt 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents investments and marketable equity securities in a variety of securities including commercial paper corporate debt securities us government and agency securities certificates of deposit and term deposits money 

market funds municipal bonds and marketable equity securities the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2021 2020 and 2019 would have resulted in an insignificant decrease in our interest income in each of these periods 

on march 5 2021 we issued 10 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 10 notes due march 15 2026 and 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 22 notes due march 15 2031 we carry the senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets as the senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates refer to note 11 debt in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the united states are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar “cad” the euro “eur” and the british pound “gbp” to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to minimize the impact of balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the credit worthiness of these parties these contracts typically have a maturity of one month and settle on the last day of each month we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts in other expense—net in the consolidated statements of income we recognized an expense of 82 million in 2021 due to foreign currency transaction losses 

our use of forward exchange contracts is intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements our forward exchange contracts are relatively shortterm in nature and are focused on the cad longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar against other foreign currencies such as the eur and gbp could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 83 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash balances as of december 31 2021 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are predominantly shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other ip rights third parties have asserted are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark or other ip rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a thirdparty could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected in certain instances we indemnify our endcustomers distributors and resellers against claims that our products infringe the ip of third parties

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance throughput features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

• addition and integration of new networking and security features and technological expertise 

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

• brand recognition 

• customer service and support across varied and complex customer segments 

• sales and distribution capabilities 

• size and financial stability 

• breadth of product line 

• form factor of the solution and 

• other competitive differentiators 

among others our competitors include barracuda networks inc “barracuda” check point software technologies ltd “check point” cisco systems inc “cisco” crowdstrike holdings inc “crowdstrike” f5 networks inc “f5 networks” fireeye inc “fireeye” forcepoint llc “forcepoint” imperva inc “imperva” juniper networks inc “juniper” mcafee llc “mcafee” palo alto networks inc “palo alto networks” proofpoint inc “proofpoint” sonicwall inc “sonicwall” sophos group plc “sophos” trend micro incorporated “trend micro” and zscaler inc “zscaler” 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance throughput reliability breadth and ability to work together our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionalities to our products 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance are better marketed or achieve greater market acceptance than our products additionally our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are better positioned to withstand a significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature over the near term accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global and regional economic conditions and spending environments geopolitical instability and uncertainty weak economic conditions in certain regions or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions including the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the foregoing issues could have adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our channel partners reduced unit sales and slower or declining growth 

our billings revenue operating margin and free cash flow growth may slow or may not continue 

  

we may experience slowing growth or a decrease in billings revenue operating margin and free cash flow for a number of reasons including as a result of the covid19 pandemic a slowdown in demand for our products or services a shift in demand from products to services increased competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market or softness in demand in certain geographies or industry verticals such as the service provider industry changes in our strategic opportunities execution risks and our failure for any reason to continue to capitalize on sales and growth opportunities due to other risks identified in the risk factors described in this periodic report our expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expected if our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings and revenue growth we may experience margin declines in addition we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue and do not appropriately manage our cost structure free cash flow or encounter unanticipated liabilities as a result any failure by us to maintain profitability and margins and continue our billings revenue and free cash flow growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business in a material way 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains and demand for certain solutions and created significant volatility in and disruption of global financial markets the extent of the future impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance including on demand for our products and services our ability to source components and our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the covid19 pandemic and related restrictions on and disruptions of business and world economies all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict an extended period of global supply chain disruption demand reduction and economic slowdown would materially negatively affect our overall business and our operating results including billings revenue gross margins operating margins cash flows and other operating results if the spread of the covid19 pandemic limits the availability of our products either by limiting components available by limiting the actual manufacture and assembly or by limiting or restricting shipping of components and products this likely would result in increased product backlog lower billings lower revenue and decreased profitability and would negatively impact and may materially negatively impact our operating results and business moreover the covid19 pandemic has created a reduction in certain business activity and demand for certain solutions which we believe has negatively impacted our billings and may in the future materially and negatively affect the rate and amount of our billings the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect certain of our partners’ and customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our products and services delay certain customers’ purchasing decisions and increase customer attrition rates all of which will adversely affect our future sales and operating results possibly in a material way as a result we may experience extended sales cycles our ability to close transactions with new and existing customers and partners may be negatively impacted our ability to recognize revenue from sales we do close may be negatively impacted certain businesses will not buy our products and services when they otherwise would have certain current partners customers and customer prospects may go out of business or face significant business challenges thereby negatively impacting our sales due to product or component shortages implementation delays or other factors and our ability to provide technical and other support to our customers may be affected we have also offered and may continue to offer payment terms in excess of our contractual agreements to some of our distributor customers 

which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to collect from these customers in addition the covid19 pandemic has caused an increase in certain of our expenses including increased shipping costs increased cancellation charges and reduced attendance fees due to the cancellation of several of our 2020 accelerate sales conferences and it may result in increased component and product manufacturing costs the covid19 pandemic has limited certain demand generation activities such as conferences and inperson sales meetings which may reduce our costs but also may reduce leads that could result in closed sales the full impact of the covid19 pandemic is unknown at this time while we continue to monitor developments and the potential effect on our business it is clear that the covid19 pandemic will negatively impact certain sales and may have a material negative impact on our operating results in the near term and longer term 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners for substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results may be harmed additionally a small number of distributors represents a large percentage of our revenue and gross accounts receivable and one distributor accounted for 34 of our total net accounts receivable as of december 31 2020 

  

a significant portion of our sales is generated through a limited number of distributors and substantially all of our revenue is from sales by our channel partners including distributors and resellers we depend on our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities and to manage our sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our products or our channel partners shift focus to other vendors andor our competitors our ability to sell our products and operating results may be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

in addition a small number of channel partners represents a large percentage of our revenue and gross accounts receivable we are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of some of our channel partners and to credit exposure in weakened markets which could result in material losses our dependence on a limited number of key channel partners means that our billings revenue and operating results may be harmed by the inability of these key channel partners to successfully sell our products and services or if any of these key channel partners is unable or unwilling to pay us terminates its relationship with us or goes out of business although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate credit and liquidity risks we cannot guarantee these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks if we are unable to adequately control these risks our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed if channel partners fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or we are otherwise unable to collect on our accounts receivable from these channel partners we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts including litigation our channel partners may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us or pay those amounts more slowly either of which could adversely affect our operating results financial position and cash flow we may be further impacted by consolidation of our existing channel partners in such instances we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be more limited we may also become increasingly dependent on a more limited number of channel partners as consolidation increases the relative proportion of our business for which each channel partner is responsible which may magnify the risks described in the preceding paragraphs 

exclusive networks group “exclusive” accounted for 34 and 36 of our total net accounts receivable as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively and six distributor customers accounted for 70 and 69 of our total net accounts receivable in the aggregate respectively during 2020 2019 and 2018 exclusive accounted for 30 31 and 30 of our total revenue respectively in addition to other risks associated with the concentration of accounts receivable and revenue from these distributors exclusive is a private equitybacked company and we may not have sufficient information to assess its financial condition and accordingly if exclusive were to experience financial difficulties we might not have advance notice additionally exclusive may face liquidity risk which may harm our ability to collect on our accounts receivable 

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them with selling our products and incentivize them to sell our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services and may purchase more inventory than they can sell our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions moreover many of our channel partners are privately held including our largest distributor exclusive and we may not have sufficient information to assess their financial condition if our channel partners’ financial condition or operations weaken their ability to sell our product and services could be negatively impacted our channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products or may decide to cease selling our products and services altogether in favor of a competitor’s products and services they may also have 

incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot ensure that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results 

any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter we typically arrange for a logistics partner to pick up the last shipment of our products a few hours prior to the end of the quarter and a delay in the arrival of the logistics partner or other factors such as a power outage could prevent us from shipping and billing for a material amount of products for which we have orders further it is possible that the dollar value of these products intended to be shipped late on the last day of the quarter may be material additionally our service billings are dependent on the completion of certain automated processes by our internal business management systems some of which cannot be performed until after the related products have been shipped if we do not have enough time after shipping our products for our systems to perform these processes prior to the end of the quarter or we have system issues that prevent processing in time to realize service billings in a quarter we will not be able to bill and realize billings for those services until the following quarter which may materially negatively impact our billings for a particular quarter we implemented a cloudbased quoting tool to help provide our sales team with the ability to have faster quote generation reduce quote errors and increase sales productivity our ability to integrate the data from this tool into our order processing may cause order processing delays that could have an effect on our financial results our billings and revenue for any quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason or our ability to fulfill orders at the end of any quarter is hindered for any reason including among others 

• the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize 

• our logistics partners’ failure or inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter 

• disruption in manufacturing or shipping based on power outages system failures labor disputes natural disasters or widespread public health problems including pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic 

• our failure to accurately forecast our inventory requirements and to appropriately manage inventory to meet demand 

• our inability to release new products on schedule 

• any failure of our systems related to order review and processing and 

• any delays in shipments due to trade compliance requirements labor disputes or logistics changes at shipping ports airline strikes severe weather or otherwise 

we rely significantly on revenue from fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services and revenue from these services may decline or fluctuate because we recognize revenue from these services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue revenue from the sale of new or from the renewal of existing fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in purchases of fortigate appliances or our fortinet security fabric platform products changes in the sales mix between products and services endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors reductions in our customers’ spending levels and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to these arrangements if our sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business could suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact our billings and revenue furthermore we recognize fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically from one to five years as a result much of the fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts entered into during previous quarters or years consequently a decline in new or renewed fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services is not reflected in full in our statements of income until future periods our fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

  

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder chief executive officer and chairman or michael xie our cofounder president and chief technology officer or of any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives the loss of the services or the distraction of our senior management for any reason including the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering sales and marketing may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we experience turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success 

competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense especially for qualified sales support and engineering employees in network security and especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel such as the san francisco bay area and vancouver canada we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs the covid19 pandemic may also decelerate our hiring and increase the challenge of recruiting qualified personnel to leave their current positions to join us in addition to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information changes in immigration laws including changes to the rules regarding h1b visas may also harm our ability to attract personnel from other countries our inability to hire properly qualified and effective sales support and engineering employees could harm our growth and our ability to effectively support growth 

risks related to our sales and endcustomers 

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world our international sales have represented a majority of our total revenue in recent periods therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

• economic or political instability in foreign markets 

  

• greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection including longer collection periods 

• longer sales processes for larger deals particularly during the summer months or as a result of the covid19 pandemic and related travel and gathering restrictions 

• changes in regulatory requirements 

  

• difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations 

  

• the uncertainty of protection for ip rights in some countries 

  

• costs of compliance with foreign policies laws and regulations and the risks and costs of noncompliance with such policies laws and regulations 

• any disruption in manufacturing or shipping or decreases in demand by channel partners or endcustomers including any such disruption or decreases caused by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and health emergencies including earthquakes fires power outages typhoons floods pandemics or epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic and manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars and critical infrastructure attacks 

• protectionist policies and penalties and local laws requirements policies and perceptions that may adversely impact a usheadquartered business’s sales in certain countries outside of the us for example over the past year our revenue from sales in china has been insignificant totaling less than 1 of aggregate revenue possibly based in part on a preference in china to do business with chinese businesses over us businesses like fortinet 

  

• costs of complying with and the risks reputational damage and other costs of noncompliance with us or other foreign laws and regulations for foreign operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” import and export control laws trade laws and regulations tariffs and retaliatory measures trade barriers and economic sanctions 

• other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets and the risks and costs of noncompliance 

• heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales or salesrelated arrangements such as sales “side agreements” to allow return rights that could disrupt the sales team through terminations of employment or otherwise and may adversely impact financial results as compared to those already reported or forecasted and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements 

• our ability to effectively implement and maintain adequate internal controls to properly manage our international sales and operations 

• political unrest changes and uncertainty associated with terrorism hostilities war or natural disasters 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

• management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion and 

• changes in tax tariff employment and other laws 

  

the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic may enhance the severity and unpredictability of a number of the foregoing risks 

product and service sales and employee and contractor matters may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep up to date with changes in government requirements as they change over time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in litigation regulatory action costs of investigation delays in revenue recognition delays in financial reporting financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may undertake corporate operating restructurings or transfers of assets that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad in order to maximize the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure if ineffectual such restructurings or transfers could increase our income tax liabilities and in turn increase our global effective tax rate moreover our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner that we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws however the tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results 

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations while we have increased sales in recent periods to large and mediumsized businesses our sales volume varies by quarter and there is risk as to our level of success selling to these target customers such sales involve unique sales skillsets processes and structures are often more complex and feature a longer contract term and may be at higher discount levels we also have experienced uneven traction selling to certain government organizations and service providers and mssps and there can be no assurance that we will be successful selling to these customers sales to these organizations involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller entities these risks include 

• increased competition from competitors that traditionally target large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations and that may already have purchase commitments from those endcustomers 

  

• increased purchasing power and leverage held by large endcustomers in negotiating contractual arrangements 

• unanticipated changes in the capital resources or purchasing behavior of large endcustomers including changes in the volume and frequency of their purchases and changes in the mix of products and services willingness to change to cloud delivery model and related payment terms 

  

• more stringent support requirements in our support service contracts including stricter support response times more complex requirements and increased penalties for any failure to meet support requirements 

• longer sales cycles and the associated risk that substantial time and resources may be spent on a potential endcustomer that elects not to purchase our products and services 

• uncertainty as to timing to close large deals and any delays in closing those deals and 

• longer rampup periods for enterprise sales personnel as compared to other sales personnel 

  

large and mediumsized businesses service providers and mssps and government organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases longer than 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with endcustomers along with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales in addition purchases by large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays in light of the current covid19 pandemic and regulations in place by various government authorities some of these sales cycles are being further extended furthermore service providers and mssps represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or continued changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business large and mediumsized businesses service providers and mssps and government organizations typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability expect a broader range of services including design implementation and post golive services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors in addition large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations may require that our products and services be sold differently from how we offer our products and services which could negatively impact our operating results our large business and service provider customers may also become more deliberate in their purchases as they plan their nextgeneration network security architecture leading them to take more time in making purchasing decisions or to purchase based only on their immediate needs all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers in addition if sales expected from a large and mediumsized endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

in addition mitigation and containment measures adopted by government authorities to contain the spread of covid19 in the united states and internationally including travel restrictions and other requirements that limit inperson meetings could limit our ability to establish and maintain relationships with new and existing customers which may exacerbate the risks described above 

if we do not increase the effectiveness of our sales organization we may have difficulty adding new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomers and our business may be adversely affected 

although we have a channel sales model sales in our industry are complex and members of our sales organization often engage in direct interaction with our prospective endcustomers particularly for larger deals involving larger endcustomers therefore we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales organization to obtain new endcustomers and sell additional products and services to our existing endcustomers there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require including experienced enterprise sales employees and others our ability to grow our revenue depends in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth and on the effectiveness of those personnel in selling successfully in different contexts each of which has its own different complexities approaches and competitive landscapes such as managing and growing the channel business for sales to small businesses and more actively selling to the endcustomer for sales to larger organizations new hires require substantial training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect especially in light of the covid19 pandemic and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business furthermore hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity if our sales employees do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected our revenue may not increase at anticipated levels and our ability to achieve longterm projections may be negatively impacted if we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing customer base our business operating results and prospects may be adversely affected if we do not hire properly qualified and effective sales employees and organize our sales team effectively to capture the opportunities in the various customer segments we are targeting our growth and ability to effectively support growth may be harmed 

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products and to improve lead generation and sales enablement our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly the market for sales to large businesses service providers and government organizations while we have increased our investments in sales and marketing it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased revenue if our investments in additional sales personnel or our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market awareness of our company and products or increasing lead generation or if we experience turnover and disruption in our sales and marketing teams we may not be able to achieve sustained growth and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected we are also limited in our marketing efforts as a result of the covid19 pandemic as mitigation and containment measures adopted by government authorities to contain the spread of covid19 including travel restrictions and other requirements that limit inperson meetings could limit our ability to establish and maintain relationships with new and existing customers and negatively affect our sales and marketing efforts 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods sales to government organizations are subject to a number of risks selling to government organizations can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense with long sales cycles and without any assurance of winning a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

• public sector budgetary cycles 

• funding authorizations and requirements unique to government agencies with funding or purchasing reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products 

• geopolitical matters including tariff and trade disputes government shutdowns and trade protectionism and other political dynamics that may adversely affect our ability to sell in certain locations or obtain the requisite permits and clearances required for certain purchases by government organizations of our products and services and 

• rules and regulations applicable to certain government sales including gsa regulations 

government spending may also be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic 

the rules and regulations applicable to sales to government organizations may also negatively impact sales to other organizations to date we have had limited traction in sales to us government agencies and any future sales to government organizations is uncertain government organizations may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such government organization the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate review and audit government vendors’ administrative and other processes and any unfavorable investigation audit other review or unfavorable determination related to any government clearance of certification could result in the government’s refusing to continue buying our products and services a limitation and reduction of government purchases of our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the investigation audit or other review uncovers improper illegal or otherwise concerning activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way further any refusal to grant certain certifications or clearances by one government agency or decision by one government agency that our products do not meet certain standards may cause reputational harm and cause concern with other government agencies governments and businesses and cause them to not buy our products and services andor lead to a decrease in demand for our products generally finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government and may not successfully obtain all certifications or clearances required for certain us government purchases 

risks related to our industry customers products and services 

we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face many competitors across the different cybersecurity markets our competitors include companies such as barracuda check point cisco crowdstrike f5 networks fireeye forcepoint imperva juniper mcafee palo alto networks proofpoint sonicwall sophos trend micro and zscaler 

  

some of our existing and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as 

  

• greater name recognition andor longer operating histories 

  

• larger sales and marketing budgets and resources 

  

• broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and endcustomers 

  

• access to larger customer bases 

  

• greater customer support resources 

  

• greater resources to make acquisitions 

• stronger us government relationships 

  

• lower labor and development costs and 

  

• substantially greater financial technical and other resources 

  

in addition certain of our larger competitors have broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of security threat are often able to deliver these specialized security products to the market more quickly than we can 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services and leverage new business models that are equal or superior to ours achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do for example certain of our competitors are focusing on delivering security services from the cloud in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions as a result of such acquisitions competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services as our customers refresh the security products bought in prior years they may seek to consolidate vendors which may result in current customers choosing to purchase products from our competitors on an ongoing basis due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to acquire and develop internally new products and enhanced versions of our existing products in order to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

• delays in releasing our new products or enhancements to the market 

  

• failure to accurately predict market demand in terms of product functionality and to supply products that meet this demand in a timely fashion 

• failure to have the appropriate research and development expertise and focus to make our top strategic fabric products successful 

  

• failure of our sales force and partners to focus on selling new products 

  

• inability to interoperate effectively with the networks or applications of our prospective endcustomers 

  

• inability to protect against new types of attacks or techniques used by hackers 

  

• actual or perceived defects vulnerabilities errors or failures 

  

• negative publicity about their performance or effectiveness 

  

• introduction or anticipated introduction of competing products by our competitors 

  

• poor business conditions for our endcustomers causing them to delay it purchases 

  

• changes to the regulatory requirements around security and 

  

• reluctance of customers to purchase products incorporating open source software 

  

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

demand for our products may be limited by market perception that individual products from one vendor that provide multiple layers of security protection in one product are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of many of our products depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality into one appliance if the market for these products fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view “allinone” network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that such products of ours provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform our solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of our product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that “allinone” solutions may be suitable only for small and mediumsized businesses because such solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large businesses service provider and government organization endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions 

become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with our market in general demand for multisecurity functionality products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco f5 networks and juniper offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory or components may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders or not place orders commensurate with our expectations if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products and accurately forecasting inventory requirements and demand can be challenging our channel partners also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to source components manufacture or ship certain products increases for any reason inventory shortfalls could result if we cannot manufacture and ship our products due to for example natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes fires power outages typhoons floods pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic or manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars and critical infrastructure attacks our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell which may impact our billings revenue margins and free cash flow mismanagement of our inventory whether due to imprecise forecasting employee errors or malfeasance inaccurate information or otherwise may adversely affect our results of operations the covid19 pandemic has resulted in challenges to obtaining components and inventory as well as increases to freight and shipping costs and may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations in order to mitigate supply chain risk from covid19 we have increased our onhand stock of certain products if we are unable to sell these products we would be required to writeoff excess inventory which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

  

inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology product transitions customer requirements or excess inventory levels if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed billings and revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have in the past experienced inventory shortages and excesses due to the variance in demand for certain products from forecasted amounts our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners including manufacturers with facilities located in taiwan china and other countries outside the united states such as microstar wistron senao adlink and ibase our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers in asia and elsewhere reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance costs supply and timing and possible tariffs any manufacturing disruption related to our thirdparty manufacturers or their component suppliers for any reason including natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes fires power outages typhoons floods health pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic and manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars and critical infrastructure attacks could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed further approximately 85 of our hardware is manufactured in taiwan any increase in tensions between china and taiwan including threats of military actions or escalation of military activities could adversely affect our manufacturing operations in taiwan 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production or shipping interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages quality problems or strike or other labor disruption at one of our manufacturing partners or locations or at shipping ports or locations would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary spus which are key to the performance of our appliances are built by contract manufacturers including renesas and toshiba these contract manufacturers use foundries operated by tsmc or renesas on a purchaseorder basis and these foundries do not guarantee their capacity and could delay orders or increase their pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer inventory shortages of our spu as well as increased costs in addition to our proprietary spu we also purchase offtheshelf asics or integrated circuits from vendors for which we have experienced and may continue to experience long lead times our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes or more profitable products if any of these manufacturers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our spu or asics our business would be harmed 

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances directive the “eu rohs” adopted in the european union the “eu” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals” that are contained in our products have originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank” the securities and exchange commission the “sec” adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to efforts to determine the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements which would make it more difficult to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to 

meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage cause loss of sales and customers or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers may discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of cpus from intel network chips from broadcom marvell and intel and memory devices from intel adata toshiba samsung and western digital we also may face shortages in the supply of the capacitors and resistors that are used in the manufacturing of our products the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes fires power outages typhoons floods health pandemics and epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic and manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars critical infrastructure attacks and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

• a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required parts or components when required 

• financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers 

  

• infringement or misappropriation of our ip 

  

• price increases 

  

• failure of a component to meet environmental or other regulatory requirements 

  

• failure to meet delivery obligations in a timely fashion 

  

• failure in component quality and 

• inability to ship products on a timely basis 

  

the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and operating margin and which may adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons or our product mix may change resulting in lower growth and margins based on a number of factors including competitive pricing pressures discounts or promotional programs we offer a change in our mix of products and services and anticipation of the introduction of new products and services competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or services or may bundle them with other products or services additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions have in the past and may in the future negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products or services will decrease over product life cycles we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product and service offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices gross profits and operating margin at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to detect or prevent a security breach or the misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins cause them to fail to help secure our customers or cause our products or services to allow unauthorized access to our customers’ networks additionally any perception that our products have product vulnerabilities whether or not accurate may cause rep utation harm our products are also susceptible to errors defects logic flaws vulnerabilities and inserted vulnerabilities that may arise in or be included in our products in different stages of our supply chain manufacturing and shipment processes and a threat actor’s exploitation of these weaknesses may be difficult to anticipate prevent and detect if we are unable to maintain an effective supply chain security risk management program then the security and integrity of our products and the updates to those products that our customers receive could be exploited by third parties or insiders different customers deploy and use our products in different ways and certain deployments and usages may subject our products to adverse conditions that may negatively impact the effectiveness and useful lifetime of our products our networks and products including cloudbased technology could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation we cannot ensure that our products will prevent all adverse security events because the techniques used by malicious adversaries to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard and other security subscription or forticare updates or our fortinet appliances and operating systems could result in a failure of our fortiguard and other security subscription services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortinet appliances and cloudbased products and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our data centers and networks and those of our hosting vendors and cloud service providers may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of our customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach or any actual or perceived security risk in our supply chain could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products and services cause customers and customer prospects not to buy from us and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized third party any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

  

• the expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze correct eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities 

  

• the loss of existing or potential endcustomers or channel partners 

  

• delayed or lost revenue 

  

• delay or failure to attain market acceptance 

  

• negative publicity and harm to our reputation and 

  

• litigation regulatory inquiries or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects may be harmed 

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and timeconsuming research and development processes for example we enter into development agreements with third parties if our contract development projects are not successfully completed or are not completed in a timely fashion our product development could be delayed and our business generally could suffer costs for contract development can be substantial and our profitability may be harmed if we are unable to recover these costs although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

moreover business models based on saas either hosted or cloudbased services have become increasingly indemand by our endcustomers and adopted by other providers including our competitors while we have introduced additional cloudbased products and services and will continue to do so most of our platform is currently deployed on premise and therefore if customers demand that our platform be provided through a saas business model we would be required to make additional investments in our infrastructure and personnel to be able to more fully provide our platform through a saas model in order to maintain the competitiveness of our platform such investments may involve expanding our data centers servers and networks and increasing our technical operations and engineering teams these risks are compounded by the uncertainty concerning the future viability of saas business models and the future demand for such models by customers additionally if we are unable to meet the demand to provide our services through a saas model we may lose customers to competitors 

our uniform resource locator “url” database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’ expectations 

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations could impair the growth of our business 

false detection of vulnerabilities viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

our fortiguard and other security subscription services may falsely detect report and act on viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our fortiguard and other security subscription services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures in addition our threat researchers periodically identify vulnerabilities in various thirdparty products and if these identifications are perceived to be incorrect or are in fact incorrect this could harm our business any such false identification or perceived false identification of important files applications or vulnerabilities could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer highquality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners and other third parties to resolve any issues relating to our products if we our channel partners or other third parties do not effectively assist our customers in planning deploying and operational proficiency for our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many large endcustomers and service provider or government organization endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers because of their more complex deployments and more demanding environments and business models if we our channel partners or other third parties fail to meet the requirements of our larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our 

penetration with large businesses service providers and government organizations our failure to maintain highquality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to litigation reputational damage loss of customers and additional costs 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance and effectiveness of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us result in litigation and disputes with customers and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to litigation litigation costs and liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims if exceptions apply or if the provisions are deemed unenforceable and in some circumstances we may be required to indemnify a customer in full without limitation for certain liabilities including liabilities that are not contractually limited the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us if at all and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

risks related to our systems and technology 

if our internal enterprise it networks on which we conduct internal business and interface externally our operational networks through which we connect to customer systems and provide services or our research and development networks our backend labs and cloud stacks through which we research and develop products and services are compromised public perception of our products and services may be harmed our customers may be breached and harmed we may become subject to liability and our business operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted 

our success depends on the market’s confidence in our ability to provide effective network security protection despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal networks systems and websites we are still vulnerable to computer viruses breakins phishing attacks attempts to overload our servers with denialofservice and other cyberattacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our internal networks systems or websites our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance or otherwise which breaches may be more difficult to detect than outsider threats and the existing programs and trainings we have in place to prevent such insider threats may not be effective or sufficient third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to transfer funds or disclose information in order to gain access to our networks and confidential information third parties may also send our customers or others malware or malicious emails that falsely indicate that we are the source potentially causing lost confidence in us and reputational harm we cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to protect our networks systems and websites will provide adequate security moreover because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers and any security breaches and other security incidents involving us may result in more harm to our reputation and brand than companies that do not sell network security solutions hackers and malicious parties may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products and customers that impersonate our update servers in an effort to access customer networks and negatively impact customers or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees customers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our internal networks systems or data 

for example from time to time we have discovered that unauthorized parties have targeted us using sophisticated techniques including by stealing technical data and attempting to steal private encryption keys in an effort to both impersonate our products and threat intelligence update services and possibly attempt other attack methodologies using these techniques these unauthorized parties have tried and may in the future try to gain access to certain of our and our customers’ systems we have also for example discovered that unauthorized parties have targeted vulnerabilities in our product software in an effort to gain entry into our customers’ networks these and other hacking efforts against us and our customers may be ongoing and may recur in the future although we take numerous measures and implement multiple layers of security to protect our networks and our customers’ networks we cannot guarantee that our security products processes and services will secure against all threats f urther we cannot be sure that third parties have not been or will not in the future be successful in improperly accessing our systems and our customers’ systems which could negatively impact us and our customers an actual breach could significantly harm us and our customers and an actual or perceived breach or any other actual or perceived data security incident threat or vulnerability that involves our supply chains networks systems or websites andor our customers’ supply chains networks systems or websites could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services and investor confidence in our company any breach of our networks systems or websites could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services to our endcustomers lead to interruptions or system slowdowns cause loss of critical data or lead to the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential proprietary or sensitive information we could also be subject to liability and litigation and reputational harm and our channel partners and endcustomers may be harmed lose confidence in us and decrease or cease using our products and services any breach of our internal networks systems or websites could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and stock price 

in addition due to the covid19 pandemic a substantial majority of our employees are temporarily working remotely which may pose additional data security risks for example there has been an increase in phishing attempts and spam emails as well as social engineering attempts from hackers hoping to use the recent covid19 pandemic to their advantage the risks described above could therefore be exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic 

  

if we do not appropriately manage any future growth including through the expansion of our real estate facilities or are unable to improve our systems processes and controls our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

we rely heavily on information technology to help manage critical functions such as order configuration pricing and quoting revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews in addition we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on manual data entry of customer purchase orders received through email and to a lesser extent through electronic data interchange from our customers due to the use of manual processes and the fact that we may receive a large amount of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter an interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased billings and revenue for that quarter 

to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial operating security and administrative systems and controls and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and processes we must also continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems controls and processes such as system capacity access security and change management controls in a timely or efficient manner our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner whether as a result of the significant growth of our business or otherwise may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses moreover the failure of our systems and processes could undermine our ability to provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results and could impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

in addition our systems processes and controls may not prevent or detect all errors omissions malfeasance or fraud such as corruption and improper “side agreements” that may impact revenue recognition or result in financial liability our productivity and the quality of our products and services may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to ensure appropriate systems processes and controls and to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our reputation and results of operations 

we have expanded our office real estate holdings to meet our projected growing need for office space we have started construction on a second building adjacent to our headquarters as we expand our campus in sunnyvale california these plans will require significant capital expenditure over the next several years and involve certain risks including impairment charges and acceleration of depreciation changes in future business strategy that may decrease the need for expansion such as a decrease in headcount or increase in work from home and risks related to construction future changes in growth or fluctuations in cash flow may also negatively impact our ability to pay for these projects or free cash flow additionally inaccuracies in our projected capital expenditures could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

  

we may experience difficulties maintaining and expanding our internal business management systems 

  

the maintenance of our internal business management systems such as our enterprise resource planning “erp” and customer relationship management “crm” systems has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources in addition we may choose to upgrade or expand the functionality of our internal systems leading to additional costs we may also discover deficiencies in our design or maintenance of our internal systems that could adversely affect our ability to forecast orders process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations accurately maintain books and records provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business additionally if any of our internal systems does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed further we may expand the scope of our erp and crm systems our operating results may be adversely affected if these upgrades or expansions are delayed or if the systems do not function as intended or are not sufficient to meet our operating requirements 

risks related to our intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from time to time legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other ip rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license the gnu lesser public license the bsd license the apache license the mit x license and the mozilla public license from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ ip rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of ip rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as for example open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that for example could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which requirements could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other ip disputes are common in the network security industry third parties are currently asserting have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of ip rights against us third parties have also asserted such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we may indemnify against claims that our products infringe the ip rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies nonpracticing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes as well as general commercial litigation and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion 

we have several ongoing patent lawsuits certain companies have sent us demand letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and organizations have sent letters demanding that we provide indemnification for patent claims as two examples of the ongoing patent lawsuits against us one such patent lawsuit by british telecommunications plc was filed in federal court in delaware in july 2018 and a second such lawsuit by finjan inc was filed in federal court in california in october 2018 and additional patent lawsuits have been filed against us since given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our 

industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities and recent nonpracticing entity and operating entity patent litigation against other companies in the security space we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any settlement payment or adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products include software or other ip licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products licensors may claim we owe them additional license fees for past and future use of their software and other ip or that we cannot utilize such software or ip in our products going forward there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or for reasonable pricing or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may result in significant license fees and have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other ip licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

we also rely on technologies licensed from third parties in order to operate functions of our business if any of these third parties allege that we have not properly paid for such licenses or that we have improperly used the technologies under such licenses we may need to pay additional fees or obtain new licenses and such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all or may be costly in any such case or if we were required to redesign our internal operations to function with new technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

other risks related to our business and financial position 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose endcustomers in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state regional local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety product labeling environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws data privacy laws import and export controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations sanctions enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

for example the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 and superseded current eu data protection regulations imposes stringent data handling requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the eu noncompliance with the gdpr could result in significant penalties including data protection audits and heavy fines compliance with and the other burdens imposed by the gdpr may limit our ability to operate or expand our business in europe and could adversely impact our operating results as could delays or shortcomings in the implementation of our gdpr compliance program in july 2020 the european court of justice issued a judgment declaring invalid the euus privacy shield framework the “privacy shield” as a mechanism for exportation of personal data from the european economic area to the united states though we are not participants of the privacy shield and instead employ alternative mechanisms for personal data transfers the ruling raises questions as to gdpr implications and adequate data protection in the united states and may have an impact on our european customers and related business operations 

additionally we may be subject to other legal regimes throughout the world governing data handling protection and privacy for example in june 2018 california passed the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies and became effective on january 1 2020 the costs of compliance with and the penalties for violations of the gdpr and ccpa along with other burdens imposed by these regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business 

selling our solutions to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements government permit and clearance requirements and other risks failure to comply with these requirements or to obtain and maintain government permits and clearances required to do certain business by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines suspension limitations on business or debarment from doing business with the us government or one of its divisions as well as other penalties and damages which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and prospects any violations of regulatory and contractual requirements could result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our revenue operating results financial condition and prospects 

these laws regulations and other requirements impose added costs on our business and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements including noncompliance in the past could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners penalties termination of contracts loss of exclusive rights in our ip and temporary suspension permanent debarment from government contracting or other limitations on doing business any such damages penalties disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales and that could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the united states only with the required export license or through an export license exception or may be prohibited altogether from export to certain countries if we were to fail to comply with us export laws us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits eg for stocking orders placed by our partners we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements to change tax provisions related to global manufacturing and sales or to impose new tariffs economic sanctions or related legislation any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business benefits directly and indirectly from free trade agreements and we also rely on various us corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we develop market and sell our products and services globally efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements or to change corporate tax policy related to international commerce could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as could the continuing uncertainty regarding whether such actions will be taken 

moreover efforts to implement changes related to export or import regulations including the imposition of new border taxes or tariffs on foreign imports trade barriers economic sanctions and other related policies could harm our results of operations for example in recent years the united states has imposed additional import tariffs on certain goods from different countries and on most of chinese imported goods as a result china and other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods exported from the united states and both the united states and foreign countries have threatened to alter or leave current trade agreements while we do not currently expect these tariffs to have a significant effect on our raw material and product import costs if the united states expands increased tariffs or retaliatory trade measures are taken by china or other countries in response to the tariffs the cost of our products could increase our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to raise our prices which may result in the loss of customers and harm to our reputation and operating performance 

any modification in these areas any shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or any change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential endcustomers with international operations and could result in increased costs any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products laws relating to our real property and future expansion plans and laws concerning the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs directive eu regulation 19072006 – registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals the “reach” regulation and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban or restrict the presence of certain hazardous substances such as lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium and certain fireretardant plastic additives in electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off scrapped noncompliant inventory we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on exemptions for lead and other substances in network infrastructure equipment it is possible one or more of these use exemptions will be revoked in the future additionally although some of the eu rohs exemptions have been extended it is possible that some of these exemptions may expire in the future without being extended if this exemption is revoked or expires without extension if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us andor disrupt our operations or logistics 

as part of the circular economy action plan the european commission amended the eu waste framework directive “wfd” to include a number of measures related to waste prevention and recycling starting on january 5 2021 we will be responsible for submitting product data to a database of hazardous substances known as the substances of concern in articles as such and in complex objects products database the “scip database” the scip database was established under the wfd and will be managed by the european chemicals agency we expect to incur costs in order to comply with this new requirement 

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products technologies or ip such as patents for example we acquired opaq in july 2020 and panopta in december 2020 for any possible future acquisitions we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition or financing the acquisition for both our prior and future acquisitions we may not be successful in effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or ip and sales force into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies ip or products with our existing product lines integrating reporting systems and procedures and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies for example we may experience difficulties integrating an acquired company’s erp or crm systems sales support and other processes and systems with our current systems and processes our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with ip product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or ip could significantly divert management time and resources 

risks related to finance accounting and tax matters 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition deferred contract costs and commission expense valuation of inventory accounting for business combination contingent liabilities and accounting for income taxes 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro canadian dollar and british pound additionally fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar may negatively impact our development plans in burnaby canada while we are not currently engaged in material hedging activities we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts through the use of forward exchange contracts if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currencydenominated operating expenses in addition a strengthening of the us dollar may increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of our subsidiaries are organized our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control these include 

• the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or withholding taxes 

• changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 

• transfer pricing adjustments 

• an increase in nondeductible expenses for tax purposes including certain stockbased compensation expense 

• changes in availability of tax credits andor tax deductions 

• tax costs related to intercompany realignments 

• tax assessments resulting from income tax audits or any related tax interest or penalties that could significantly affect our provision for income taxes for the period in which the settlement takes place and 

• changes in accounting principles court decisions tax rulings and interpretations of or changes to tax laws and regulations by international federal or local governmental authorities 

we have open tax years that could be subject to the examination by the internal revenue service the “irs” and other tax authorities we currently have ongoing tax audits in the united kingdom canada and several other foreign jurisdictions the focus of all of these audits is the allocation of profit between our legal entities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results 

we may undertake corporate operating restructurings or transfers of assets that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad in order to maximize the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure if ineffectual such restructurings or transfers could increase our income tax liabilities and in turn increase our global effective tax rate moreover our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner that we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws however the tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates in a given jurisdiction differs from our estimate our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations additionally our actual tax rate may be subject to further uncertainty due to potential changes in us and foreign tax rules 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently tax authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” an international association comprised of 37 countries including the united states has issued and continues to issue guidelines and proposals that change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business due to our extensive international business activities any changes in the taxation of such activities could increase our tax obligations in many countries and may increase our worldwide effective tax rate 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sarbanesoxley” doddfrank and other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these requirements as well as proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations sarbanesoxley requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly although our most recent assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2020 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2021 or future periods we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report news about us and our financial results the impact of the covid19 pandemic news about our competitors and their results and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us for example during 2020 the closing price of our common stock ranged from 7570 to 15215 per share 

furthermore stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business in addition the market price of our common stock and the market price of the common stock of many other companies have fallen significantly since the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may impact the market price of our common stock is unclear and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

share repurchases under our repurchase program the “repurchase program” could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock could diminish our cash reserves could occur at nonoptimal prices and may not result in the most effective use of our capital 

in july 2020 our board of directors approved a 5000 million increase in the authorized stock repurchase amount under the repurchase program and extended the term of the repurchase program to february 28 2022 bringing the aggregate amount authorized to be repurchased to 30 billion as of december 31 2020 101 billion remained available for future share repurchases under the repurchase program share repurchases under the repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock increase stock price volatility and diminish our cash reserves in addition an announcement of the reduction suspension or termination of the repurchase program could result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock moreover our stock price could decline resulting in repurchases made at nonoptimal prices our failure to repurchase our stock at optimal prices may be perceived by investors as an inefficient use of our cash and cash equivalents which could result in litigation that may have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition while our board of directors carefully considers various alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents in determining whether to authorize stock repurchases there can be no assurance that the decision by our board of directors to repurchase stock would result in the most effective uses of our cash and cash equivalents and there may be alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents that would be more effective such as investing in growing our business organically or through acquisitions 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

• authorizing “blank check” preferred stock which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock 

  

• limiting the liability of and providing indemnification to our directors and officers 

  

• requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors 

• providing that certain litigation matters may only be brought against us in state or federal courts in the state of delaware 

  

• controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings and 

  

• providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings 

  

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

in addition our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum to the fullest extent permitted by law the federal district courts of the united states shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act of 1933 as amended any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision this provision as well as provisions providing that certain litigation matters may only be brought against us in state or federal courts in the state of delaware may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

however these antitakeover provisions will not have the effect of preventing activist stockholders from seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as nominating board candidates and requesting that we pursue strategic combinations or other transactions these actions could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of activist stockholder actions could result in the loss of potential business opportunities as well as other negative business consequences actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect our business further we may incur significant expenses in retaining professionals to advise and assist us on activist stockholder matters including legal financial communications advisors and solicitation experts which may negatively impact our future financial results 

general risks 

global economic uncertainty and weakening product demand caused by political instability and conflict could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

economic uncertainty in various global markets caused by political instability and conflict and economic challenges caused by the covid19 pandemic has resulted and may continue to result in weakened demand for our products and services and difficulty in forecasting our financial results and managing inventory levels political developments impacting government spending and international trade including potential government shutdowns and election year instability in the united states and trade disputes and tariffs may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions the effects of these events may continue due to potential us government shutdowns and the transition in administrations and the united states’ ongoing trade disputes with china and other countries the continuing effect of any or all of these events could adversely impact demand for our products harm our operations and weaken our financial results 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages typhoon floods virus outbreaks and other broad healthrelated challenges and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest labor disruption critical infrastructure attack and terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire power outage flood viral outbreak or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity and our research and development and data center in burnaby canada from which we deliver to customers our fortiguard and other security subscription updates is subject to the risk of flooding and is also in a region known for seismic activity any earthquake in the bay area or burnaby or flooding in burnaby could materially negatively impact our ability to provide products and services such as forticare support and fortiguard subscription services and could otherwise materially negatively impact our business in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products or performing or assisting with shipments on a timely basis as well as our customers’ ability to order from us and our employees’ ability to perform their duties for example a typhoon in taiwan could materially negatively impact our ability to ship products and could result in delays and reductions in billings and revenues and the covid19 pandemic will negatively impact our ability to manufacture and ship products 

possibly in a material way and could result in delays and reductions in billings and revenues also possibly in a material way in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in our missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability civil unrest labor disruptions acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or of the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at the end of each quarter any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results to the extent that any of the above results in security risks to our customers delays or cancellations of customer orders the delay of the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products or interruption or downtime of our services our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing or new accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to accounting for credit losses on financial instruments which became effective for us on january 1 2020 as well as significant costs incurred or that may be incurred to adopt and to comply with these new pronouncements could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which could have an adverse effect on our business our ability to meet our reporting obligations and compliance with internal control requirements 

management will continue to make judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of new standards if our circumstances change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock further equity investments are required to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income which may increase the volatility of our earnings

correction of prior period financial data 

as discussed further in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we identified an immaterial error related to the commencement of revenue recognition for certain forticare support service contracts which resulted in an understatement of revenue during the years ended 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the correction of this error resulted in increases to service revenue gross profit and operating income of 68 million and 34 million for the year ended 2019 and 2018 respectively net income increased by 52 million and 27 million for the year ended 2019 and 2018 respectively this resulted in an increase to diluted net income per share of 003 and 001 for the year ended 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we evaluated the effect of this correction on the previous results of operations and determined that it did not materially impact any trends previously disclosed this correction did not impact net cash provided by operating activities billings or free cash flows

covid19 update 

the united states and the global community we serve are facing unprecedented challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic in response to the pandemic we have taken a number of actions to protect our employees including restricting travel and directing most of our employees to work from home where onsite work is permitted we have implemented measures such as staggered work shifts social distancing the use of face coverings health safety awareness training and frequent disinfection of shared spaces we have implemented our readiness plans which include steps to maintain critical internet infrastructure with many employees working remotely 

we are also providing free online information technology security training for the public aimed at helping high school and college students and professionals augment their security skill sets to open career opportunities and to help narrow the security skills gap as of december 31 2020 there have been over 800000 registrations for our free online trainings since we launched the program we will continue to provide free online trainings in 2021 

while the broader implications of the covid19 pandemic on our employees and overall financial performance remain uncertain we have seen certain impacts on our business and operations results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and capital and financial resources as of and during the year ended december 31 2020 conversely some aspects of our business do not appear to have been significantly affected during the year ended december 31 2020 we have observed the following 

• in most countries our employees ability to travel was reduced inperson sales and marketing events or meetings that would normally have been held were canceled postponed or converted into virtual events as a result expenses related to travel and marketing events decreased significantly to the extent that it becomes safe for our employees to travel and for us to hold or attend marketing events these expenses may increase in the future although we cannot predict if or when such expenses will increase or return to prepandemic levels 

• after performing additional credit review of our existing customers including obtained credit reports and reviewing their latest available statements of financial position we increased the allowance of credit losses for certain accounts receivable the allowance for credit losses was 25 million as of december 31 2020 provisions writeoffs and recoveries were not material during the year ended december 31 2020 

• we have offered payment terms in excess of our contractual agreements to certain distributor customers which has resulted in an increase to the average collection period of our trade receivables as of december 31 2020 97 of our outstanding trade accounts receivable was due to be collected during the first quarter of 2021 

• the countries and geographic regions in which we experienced the fastest billings growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 were countries and geographic regions in which the covid19 pandemic is generally considered to have had a comparatively shorter or less severe impact on the local population and economy during the quarter 

• we have noted that for some of our customers sales cycles appear to have lengthened though it is unclear whether this trend will persist 

• our average service contract duration increased by approximately two months in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 

• in order to mitigate supply chain risk and in anticipation of fourthquarter demand we have increased our onhand stock of certain products 

• the yield on investmentgrade debt has decreased and while the risk of credit losses on our investments and cash equivalents has not changed significantly as the debt securities in our portfolio have matured they have been replaced by securities with lower effective interest rates this has contributed to a decrease in our interest income during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same periods last year 

• in accordance with the cares act we have deferred the deposit and payment of our employer’s share of social security taxes this did not materially affect net cash provided by operating activities during the period 

t hrough the filing of this annual report on form 10k t here have been no material changes to the trends described above going forward however the situation is uncertain rapidly changing and hard to predict and the covid19 pandemic may have a material negative impact on our future periods if we experience significant changes in our billings growth rates it will impact product revenue in the current quarter and fortiguard and forticare service revenues in subsequent quarters as we sell annual and multiyear service contracts that are recognized ratably over the contractual service term in addition the broader implications of the pandemic on our business and operations and our financial results including the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will impact future results and growth in the cybersecurity industry remain uncertain the duration and severity of the economic downturn from the pandemic may negatively impact our business and operations results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and capital and financial resources in a material way as a result the effects of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods for further discussion see part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

business model 

we typically sell our security solutions to distributors that sell to networking security focused resellers and to service providers and managed security service providers “mssps” who in turn sell to endcustomers at times we also sell directly to large service providers and major systems integrators who may sell to our endcustomers or use our products and services to provided hosted solutions to other enterprises our endcustomers are located in over 80 countries and include small medium and large enterprises and government organizations across a wide range of industries including telecommunications government financial services retail technology education manufacturing and healthcare an endcustomer deployment may involve as few as one or as many as thousands of appliances and other fortinet security fabric platform products depending on the endcustomer’s size and security requirements 

we also offer our products through major cloud providers and have recognized revenue on a usage basis from amazon web services microsoft azure google cloud oracle cloud alibaba cloud and ibm cloud we have also recognized revenue from customers who deploy our products in a bringyourownlicense “byol” arrangement in private clouds or at cloud providers in a byol arrangement a customer purchases a software license from us through our channel partners and deploys the software in a cloud provider’s environment similarly customers may purchase such a license from us and deploy in thirdparty clouds or in their private cloud 

our customers purchase our hardware products and software licenses as well as our fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support services we generally invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and security and technical support services standard payment terms are generally no more than 60 days though as noted in the covid19 update above we have recently offered extended payment terms to certain distributor customers 

key metrics 

we monitor a number of key metrics including the key financial metrics set forth below in order to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies the following table summarizes revenue deferred revenue billings nongaap net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow nongaap we discuss revenue below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss net cash provided by operating activities below under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue billings nongaap and free cash flow nongaap are discussed immediately below the following table 



deferred revenue our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unrecognized portion of service revenue from fortiguard and other security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual service period we monitor our deferred revenue balance deferred revenue growth and the mix of shortterm and longterm deferred revenue because deferred revenue represents a significant portion of free cash flow and of revenue to be recognized in future periods deferred revenue was 261 billion as of december 31 2020 an increase of 4962 million or 24 from december 31 2019  

billings nongaap we define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period and adjustments to the deferred revenue balance due to adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers “topic 606” less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations during the period we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive current and future revenue which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business there are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of gaap revenue first billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue and are impacted by the term of security and support agreements second we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding gaap revenue and evaluating billings together with gaap revenue total billings were 309 billion for 2020 an increase of 19 compared to 260 billion in 2019 

a reconciliation of revenue the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to billings is provided below 



free cash flow nongaap we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment and excluding any significant nonrecurring items we believe free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after capital expenditures can be used for strategic opportunities including repurchasing outstanding common stock investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet a limitation of using free cash flow rather than the gaap measures of cash provided by or used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance for the period because it excludes cash flows from investing activities other than capital expenditures and cash flows from financing activities management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the consolidated statements of cash flows and under “—liquidity and capital resources” and by presenting cash flows from investing and financing activities in our reconciliation of free cash flow in addition it is important to note that other companies including companies in our industry may not use free cash flow may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to free cash flow is provided below

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of the significant accounting policies described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

revenues are recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services 

we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 

• identification of a contract or contracts with a customer 

• identification of the performance obligations in a contract including evaluation of performance obligations as to being distinct goods or services in a contract 

• determination of a transaction price 

• allocation of a transaction price to the performance obligations in a contract and 

• recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation 

our sales contracts typically contain multiple deliverables such as hardware software license security subscription technical support services and other services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations our hardware and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities accordingly the hardware and software licenses are distinct from the security subscription and technical support services as a customer can benefit from the product without the services and the services are separately identifiable within a contract we allocate a transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price we establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately if not observable through past transactions we determine standalone selling price by considering multiple historical factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies and the term of a service contract 

deferred contract costs and commission expense 

we defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts contract costs which primarily consist of sales commissions are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates costs for initial contracts that are not commensurate with renewal commissions are amortized on a straightline basis over the period of benefit of five years significant estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for deferred contract costs include but are not limited to identification of contract costs anticipated billings and the expected period of benefit 

valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using the firstin firstout method in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

business combinations 

we include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill we often continue to gather additional information throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded such changes are recorded in the period in which they are identified 

contingent liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in disputes litigation and other legal actions however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other thirdparty claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations we review significant new claims and litigation for the probability of an adverse outcome estimates can change as individual claims develop the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in addition deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of the position that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

effective january 1 2018 the 2017 tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax our selection of an accounting policy for 2018 with respect to the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” tax rules was to treat gilti tax as a current period expense under the period cost method for 2019 and 2020 we were not subject to gilti we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the 2017 tax act and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations issued in response to the 2017 tax act 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of income become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets would be recorded in the consolidated statements of income for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 





discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2019 as compared to 2018 can be found in item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 filed with the sec on february 26 2020 

2020 and 2019 

revenue 



total revenue increased by 4314 million or 20 in 2020 compared to 2019 we continued to experience diversification of revenue globally and across both customer and industry segments revenue from all regions grew with emea contributing the largest portion of the increase on an absolute dollar basis and apac contributing the fastest growth on a percentage basis 

product revenue increased by 1279 million or 16 in 2020 compared to 2019 we experienced revenue growth across many of our products due to an increase in product revenue from our fortigate sdwan solutions software licenses and our security fabric platform products 

service revenue increased by 3035 million or 22 in 2020 compared to 2019 fortiguard security subscription forticare technical support and other revenues increased by 1679 million and 1356 million respectively or 22 in 2020 compared to 2019 the increases were primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance related to fortiguard and other security subscriptions and forticare technical support including our customers moving to highertier support offerings 

of the service revenue recognized in 2020 68 was included in the deferred revenue balance as of december 31 2019 of the service revenue recognized in 2019 68 was included in the deferred revenue balance as of december 31 2018 

cost of revenue and gross margin 



total gross margin increased by 14 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2019 driven primarily by improvements to product gross margins 

product gross margin increased by 27 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2019 product gross margin benefited from lower direct costs of hardware as a percentage of product revenue and increased software sales cost of product revenue was comprised primarily of thirdparty contract manufacturers’ costs and the costs of materials used in production 

service gross margin increased by 02 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2019 as our personnel costs grew slower than our service revenue and we experienced lower costs to replace and repair our products cost of service revenue was comprised primarily of personnel costs 

operating expenses 



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 643 million or 23 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 490 million as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements to our existing products in addition product development costs such as thirdparty testing and prototypes increased 123 million we currently intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization and expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2021 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 1450 million or 16 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 1734 million as a result of increases to sales and marketing headcount in order to drive global market revenue increases this increase was offset by savings related to decreased travel and fewer inperson marketing events as a result of the covid19 pandemic we currently intend to continue to make investments in sales and marketing resources which are critical to support our future growth and expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2021 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 174 million or 17 in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 93 million an increase in legalrelated costs of 25 million an increase in professional services fee of 22 million and an increase in the provision for expected credit losses of 20 million we currently expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2021 

gain on ip matter 

in january 2020 we entered into an agreement with a competitor in the network security industry whereby in february 2020 the competitor party paid us a lump sum of 500 million for a mutual covenantnottosue for patent claims in 2020 we recorded a 402 million gain on intellectual property matter in our consolidated statements of income see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the gain on ip matter 

operating income and margin 

we generated operating income of 5318 million in 2020 an increase of 1808 million or 52 compared to 3510 million in 2019 operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 20 in 2020 compared to 16 in 2019 the increase in operating margin is primarily due to the 402 million gain on ip matter the 14 percentage point improvement in gross margin and the 16 percentage point decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue 

interest income—net and other expense — net 



interest income—net decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates and to a lesser extent lower invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments interest income—net varies depending on our average investment balances during the period types and mix of investments and market interest rates the change in other expense—net in 2020 as compared to 2019 was the result of a 43 million impairment charge on an investment in a privately held company during 2020 compared to a 38 million impairment charge on an investment in a privately held company in the same period last year 

provision for benefit from income taxes 



our provision for income taxes for 2020 reflects an effective tax rate of 10 compared to an effective tax rate of 14 for 2019 the provision for income taxes for 2020 was comprised primarily of a 1468 million tax expense related to us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes and unrecognized tax benefits the provision was partially offset by a tax benefit of 443 million from the fdii deduction excess tax benefits of 420 million from stockbased compensation expense and tax benefits of 75 million from federal research and development tax credits 

our provision for income taxes for 2019 reflects an effective tax rate of 14 compared to an effective tax rate benefit of 32 for 2018 the provision for income taxes for 2019 was comprised primarily of a 903 million tax expense related to us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes and a 101 million tax expense for an unrecognized tax benefit related to the ninth circuit’s opinion in altera corporation and subsidiaries vs commissioner of internal revenue “altera” the provision was partially offset by excess tax benefits of 393 million from stockbased compensation expense and tax benefits of 68 million from federal research and development tax credits 

unaudited quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of income for the last eight quarters the quarterly results of operations for the four quarters of 2019 were adjusted for an immaterial error related to the commencement of revenue recognition for certain forticare support service contracts which resulted in an understatement of revenue see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further detail additionally the quarterly results of operations for the first two quarters of 2020 were also adjusted to reflect the correction of the immaterial error related to the commencement of revenue recognition for certain forticare support service contracts which resulted in an understatement of revenue 

the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period 







2 total amortization included in product costs service costs and sales and marketing expense are as follows 



seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend which has positively impacted billings and product revenue activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential customer buying followed by an increase in buying in the second quarter in 2020 seasonality was impacted by the covid19 pandemic although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

consistent with the seasonality note above our total quarterly revenue over the past two years has generally increased sequentially each year product revenue increased yearoveryear as compared to 2019 as we have continued product innovation and successfully launched new product models expanded our solution sales with focus on sdwan and work from home solutions and continued our investments in our sales and marketing organizations due to our growing customer base we continue to see a relative shift from product revenue to highermargin recurring service revenue 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to the relative service and product mix as well as the seasonality of cost increases product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold their cost profile and the average selling prices of our products in 2020 product gross margin was impacted by new product introductions and the mix of highend midrange and entrylevel products and other fabric appliances as well as increasing software sales we have been able to improve our direct cost of appliances with newer generations and our product gross margin continuously benefits from increasing software sales service gross margin is impacted by revenue growth and our personnelrelated costs thirdparty repair and contract fulfillment data center and cloud hosting supplies and facilityrelated costs 

liquidity and capital resources 



liquidity and capital resources is impacted by our operating activities as well as by our stock repurchases proceeds from the issuances of common stock under our the amended and restated fortinet inc 2009 equity incentive plan the “2009 plan” and payment of taxes in connection with the net settlement of equity awards real estate and other capital expenditures and business acquisitions 

in recent years we have received significant capital resources from our billings to customers and to some extent from the exercise of stock options by our employees additional increases in billings may depend on a number of factors including demand for our products and services competition market or industry changes macroeconomic events such as the covid19 pandemic and our ability to execute we expect proceeds from the exercise of stock options in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units versus stock options granted to our employees and to vary based on our share price 

in february 2020 we received a cash payment of 500 million pursuant to a mutual covenantnottosue and release agreement with a competitor in the network security industry 

in july 2020 our board of directors approved a 5000 million increase in the authorized stock repurchase amount under the repurchase program and extended the term of the repurchase program to february 28 2022 bringing the aggregate amount authorized to be repurchased to 30 billion in 2020 we repurchased 117 million shares of common stock under the repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of 108 billion as of december 31 2020 101 billion remained available for future share repurchases under the repurchase program 

construction of a second building at our headquarters campus started in the fourth quarter of 2018 and related spending will continue until project completion we estimate 2021 spending on the second building of our headquarters campus project to be between 500 million and 600 million which was moved from 2020 due to a delay to the project schedule as a result of the covid19 pandemic we estimate construction to be completed in the first half of 2021 

as of december 31 2020 our cash cash equivalents and investments of 196 billion were invested primarily in deposit accounts money market funds corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit and term deposits and us government securities it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital provides liquidity and generates return without significantly increasing risk we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments held by our international subsidiaries was 1198 million and 1093 million as of december 31 2020 and as of december 31 2019 respectively 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and amount of our share repurchases the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the continuing market acceptance of our products the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts our investments in purchasing or leasing real estate and macroeconomic impacts such as the covid19 pandemic historically we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisition activities in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 

operating activities 

cash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity it is primarily comprised of net income as adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash adjustments consist primarily of stockbased compensation amortization of deferred contract costs and depreciation and amortization changes in operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of changes in deferred revenue deferred contract costs and accounts receivable 

our operating activities during 2020 provided 108 billion in cash as a result of the continued growth of our business and our ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard and other security services subscription and forticare technical support services to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue and proceeds from the mutual covenantnottosue and release agreement our total deferred revenue balance grew 4962 million or 24 during 2020 

investing activities 

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments and purchases of property and equipment historically in making a lease versus ownership decision related to our larger facilities we have considered various factors including financial metrics and the impact on our engineers and other employees in certain cases we have elected to own the facility if we believed that ownership rather than leasing is more in line with our longterm strategy we may make similar decisions in the future we may also make cash payments in connection with future business combinations 

during 2020 cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by 1259 million spent on purchases of property and equipment a large portion of which relates to our headquarters building construction and 402 million used for the opaq and panopta acquisitions net of cash acquired and partially offset by 920 million provided by sales and maturities of investments net of purchases of investments 

financing activities 

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to repurchase and retirement of common stock and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the 2009 plan 

during 2020 cash used in financing activities was 117 billion primarily due to 108 billion used to repurchase shares of our common stock 861 million used to pay tax withholding net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and 41 million used to pay debt assumed in connection with the opaq acquisition 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following summarizes our inventory purchase commitments as of december 31 2020 



in addition to commitments with contract manufacturers we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services as of december 31 2020 we had 289 million in other contractual commitments having a remaining term in excess of one year that may not be cancelable 

as of december 31 2020 we had 903 million of longterm income tax liabilities including interest related to uncertain tax positions because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during 2020 2019 and 2018 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities including corporate debt securities certificates of deposit and term deposits commercial paper money market funds and us government and agency securities the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2020 2019 and 2018 would have resulted in an insignificant decrease in our interest income in each of these periods 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the united states are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar “cad” the euro “eur” and the british pound “gbp” to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to minimize the impact of balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the credit worthiness of these parties these contracts typically have a maturity of one month and settle on the last day of each month we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts in other expense—net in the consolidated statements of income we recognized an expense of 55 million in 2020 due to foreign currency transaction losses 

our use of forward exchange contracts is intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements our forward exchange contracts are relatively shortterm in nature and are focused on the cad longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar against other foreign currencies such as the eur and gbp could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 59 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash balances as of december 31 2020 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are predominantly shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

technology and architecture 

the fortinet security fabric platform helps organizations secure their environments and reduce their security and network complexities the fortinet security fabric platform has an open architecture designed to connect fortinet solutions and thirdparty solutions into a single ecosystem 

our proprietary spu hardware architecture fortios operating system and associated security and networking functions are combined to form the fortinet security fabric platform  this approach to security ties together discrete security solutions into an integrated whole which enables our products to perform security processing for networks with high throughput requirements across a broad threat landscape 

spu 

our proprietary spu s are applicationspecific integrated circuits “ asic s” that include i the content processor “ spu cp ” ii the network processor “ spu np ” and iii the systemonachip “ spu soc ” each successive generation of spu adds network speed and the capacity to perform security functions our spu s are designed to enhance the security processing capabilities implemented in software by accelerating computationally intensive tasks such as firewall policy enforcement sdwan  network address translation intrusion prevention systems “ ips ” threat detection and encryption 

the use of spus allows our appliances to deliver security functionality with minimal impact to network throughput performance which we believe delivers a lower total cost of ownership “tco” to our customers as the security needs of our endcustomers increase we believe that our tco and our spus will give our products a competitive advantage against other architectural approaches 

entrylevel fortigate products often use the spu soc to provide the necessary acceleration at this level midrange fortigate products use a central processing unit “ cpu ” and include the spu np and spu cp hardware acceleration the highend fortigate products use multiple cpu s spu cp s and spu np s 

fortios 

our proprietary fortios operating system provides the foundation for the operation of all fortigate appliances whether physical virtual private or public cloud based and is at the heart of the fortinet security fabric platform  we make regular updates to fortios available through our forticare support services 

the security and networking capabilities of the fortinet security fabric platform are controlled through fortios the core kernel functions to the security processing feature sets work together to provide a highly integrated solution fortios provides i multiple layers of security including a hardened kernel layer providing protection for the fortigate system ii a network security layer providing security for endcustomers’ network infrastructures and iii application content protection providing security for endcustomers’ workstations and applications fortios directs the operations of processors and spus and provides system management functions such as command line graphical user interfaces multiple network and security topology views 

key highlevel functions and capabilities of fortios include 

 

fortios also enables advanced integrated routing and switching allowing endcustomers to deploy fortigate devices within a wide variety of networks as well as providing a direct replacement solution option for legacy switching and routing equipment fortios implements a suite of commonly used standardsbased routing protocols as well as network address translation technologies allowing the fortigate appliance to integrate and operate in a wide variety of network environments additional features include virtual domain capabilities which can provide support for multiple customers on a single device or fortios instance fortios also provides capabilities for the logging of traffic for forensic analysis purposes which are particularly important for regulatory compliance initiatives such as payment card industry data security standards fortios is designed to help control network traffic in order to optimize performance by including functionality such as packet classification queue disciplines policy enforcement congestion management widearea network “wan” optimization and caching these features enable administrators to set the appropriate configurations and policies that meet their infrastructure needs

intellectual property 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology we periodically have discussions with third parties regarding licensing fortinet’s intellectual property and have sometimes taken legal action against competitors to protect our intellectual property and as a result third parties have paid us fees in return for licenses or covenantsnottosue related to fortinet intellectual property as of december 31 2019  we had 626 us and foreignissued patents and 175 pending us and foreign patent applications we also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products including open source software and other software 

despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights third parties have asserted are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected in certain instances we indemnify our endcustomers distributors and resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties 

seasonality 

for information regarding seasonality in our sales see the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—quarterly results of operations—seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance throughput features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

• addition and integration of new networking and security features and technological expertise 

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

• brand recognition 

• customer service and support across varied and complex customer segments 

• sales and distribution capabilities 

• size and financial stability and 

• breadth of product line 

among others our competitors include barracuda networks inc “ barracuda ” check point software technologies ltd “ check point ” cisco systems inc “ cisco ” crowdstrike holdings inc “ crowdstrike ” f5 networks inc “ f5 networks ” fireeye inc “ fireeye ” forcepoint llc “ forcepoint ” imperva inc “ imperva ” juniper networks inc “ juniper ” mcafee llc “ mcafee ” palo alto networks inc “ palo alto networks ” proofpoint inc “ proofpoint ” sonicwall inc “ sonicwall ” sophos group plc “ sophos ” trend micro incorporated “ trend micro ” and zscaler inc “ zscaler ” 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance throughput reliability breadth and ability to work together our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionalities to our products 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance are better marketed or achieve greater market acceptance than our products additionally our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are better positioned to withstand a significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  our total headcount was 7082 employees and contractors none of our us employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in certain european and latin american countries have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain uptodate union membership we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors may lose some or all of their investment 

risks related to our business 

our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control or may be difficult to predict including 

  

 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

   

   

 

   

   

 

 



 

 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature over the near term accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global and regional economic conditions and spending environments geopolitical instability and uncertainty weak economic conditions in certain regions or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could have adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our channel partners reduced unit sales and slower or declining growth 

our billings revenue operating margin and free cash flow growth may slow or may not continue 

  

we may experience slowing growth or a decrease in billings revenue operating margin and free cash flow for a number of reasons including a slowdown in demand for our products or services a shift in demand from products to services increased competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market or softness in demand in certain geographies or industry verticals such as the service provider industry changes in our strategic opportunities execution risks and our failure for any reason to continue to capitalize on sales and growth opportunities due to other risks identified in the risk factors described in this periodic report our expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expected and if our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings and revenue growth we may experience margin declines and may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue do not appropriately manage our cost structure and free cash flow or encounter unanticipated liabilities any failure by us to maintain profitability maintain our margins and continue our billings revenue and free cash flow growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

we rely significantly on revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services and revenue from these services may decline or fluctuate because we recognize revenue from these services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue revenue from the sale of new or from the renewal of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in purchases of fortigate appliances or our fortinet security fabric platform products changes in the sales mix between products and services endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors reductions in our customers’ spending levels and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to these arrangements if our sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business could suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact our billings and revenue furthermore we recognize fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically from one to five years as a result much of the fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts entered into during previous quarters or years consequently a decline in new or renewed fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services is not reflected in full in our statements of income until future periods our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

  

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world our international sales have represented a majority of our total revenue in recent periods therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

   

 

 

   

   

   

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

   

product and service sales and employee and contractor matters may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep up to date with changes in government requirements as they change over time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in litigation regulatory action costs of investigation delays in revenue recognition delays in financial reporting financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may undertake corporate operating restructurings or transfers of assets that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad in order to maximize the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure if ineffectual such restructurings or transfers could increase our income tax liabilities and in turn increase our global effective tax rate moreover our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a 

manner that we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws however the tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results 

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations while we have increased sales in recent periods to large and mediumsized businesses our sales volume varies by quarter and there is risk as to our level of success selling to these target customers such sales involve unique sales skillsets processes and structures are often more complex and feature a longer contract term and may be at higher discount levels we also have experienced uneven traction selling to certain government organizations and service providers and managed security service providers “mssps” and there can be no assurance that we will be successful selling to these customers sales to these organizations involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller entities these risks include 

   

 

   

 

 

 

   

large and mediumsized businesses service providers and mssps and government organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases longer than 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with endcustomers along with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales in addition purchases by large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays furthermore service providers and mssps represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or continued changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business large and mediumsized businesses service providers and mssps and government organizations typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability expect a broader range of services including design implementation and post golive services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors in addition large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations may require that our products and services be sold differently from how we offer our products and services which could negatively impact our operating results our large business and service provider customers may also become more deliberate in their purchases as they plan their nextgeneration network security architecture leading them to take more time in making purchasing decisions or to purchase based only on their immediate needs all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers in addition if sales expected from a large and mediumsized endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory or components may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders or not place orders commensurate with our expectations if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products and accurately forecasting inventory requirements and demand can be challenging our channel partners also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture or ship certain products increases for any reason inventory shortfalls could result if we cannot manufacture and ship our products due to for example natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes fires power outages typhoons floods pandemics and epidemics such as the coronavirus or manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars and critical infrastructure attacks our business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell which may impact our billings revenue margins and free cash flow mismanagement of our inventory whether due to imprecise forecasting employee errors or malfeasance inaccurate information or otherwise may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology product transitions customer requirements or excess inventory levels if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed billings and revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have in the past experienced inventory shortages and excesses due to the variance in demand for certain products from forecasted amounts in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

widespread health problems such as the outbreak and spread of the coronavirus could adversely affect our business in a material way 

while the majority of our products are manufactured outside of china certain components for our products and certain of our products are manufactured in china and taiwan in addition certain of our logistics and shipping operations are in taiwan we also have other operations in asia pandemics and epidemics such as the current coronavirus outbreak or other widespread public health problems could negatively impact our business if for example the coronavirus progresses in ways that disrupt the manufacture or shipment of our products or otherwise disrupt our operations this may materially negatively impact our operating results for the first quarter of 2020 and subsequent periods including billings revenue gross margins operating margins cash flows and other operating results and our overall business if the coronavirus spreads in ways that continue to negatively impact the overall economy and buying patterns of partners or potential customers this would negatively impact and may materially negatively impact our sales operating results and business if the spread of the coronavirus limits the manufacturing of our products either by limiting components available or by limiting the actual manufacture and assembly this likely would result in increased product backlog lower billings lower revenue and decreased profitability and would negatively impact and may materially negatively impact our operating results and business in addition the coronavirus has caused an increase in our expenses including increased cancellation charges and reduced attendance fees due to the cancellation of our accelerate barcelona sales conference and it may result in increased component and product manufacturing costs these increases in expenses will likely negatively impact and may materially negatively impact our operating results for the first quarter 2020 and in subsequent periods as a result of the foregoing the coronavirus will likely negatively impact our operating results and may do so in a material way 

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder chief executive officer and chairman or michael xie our cofounder president and chief technology officer or of any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives the loss of the services or the 

distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering sales and marketing may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we experience turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success 

competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense especially for qualified sales support and engineering employees in network security and especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel such as the san francisco bay area and vancouver canada we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information changes in immigration laws including changes to the rules regarding h1b visas may also harm our ability to attract personnel from other countries our inability to hire properly qualified and effective sales support and engineering employees could harm our growth and our ability to effectively support growth 

if we do not increase the effectiveness of our sales organization we may have difficulty adding new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomers and our business may be adversely affected 

although we have a channel sales model sales in our industry are complex and members of our sales organization often engage in direct interaction with our prospective endcustomers particularly for larger deals involving larger endcustomers therefore we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales organization to obtain new endcustomers and sell additional products and services to our existing endcustomers there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require including experienced enterprise sales employees and others our ability to grow our revenue depends in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth and on the effectiveness of those personnel in selling successfully in different contexts each of which has its own different complexities approaches and competitive landscapes such as managing and growing the channel business for sales to small businesses and more actively selling to the endcustomer for sales to larger organizations new hires require substantial training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business furthermore hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity if our sales employees do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected our revenue will not increase at anticipated levels and our ability to achieve longterm projections may be negatively impacted if we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing customer base our business operating results and prospects will be adversely affected if we do not hire properly qualified and effective sales employees and organize our sales team effectively to capture the opportunities in the various customer segments we are targeting our growth and ability to effectively support growth would be harmed 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and operating margin and which may adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons or our product mix may change resulting in lower growth and margins based on a number of factors including competitive pricing pressures discounts or promotional programs we offer a change in our mix of products and services and anticipation of the introduction of new products and services competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or services or may bundle them with other products or services additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions have in the past and may in the future negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products or services will decrease over product life 

cycles we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product and service offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices gross profits and operating margin at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

if our internal enterprise it networks on which we conduct internal business and interface externally our operational networks through which we connect to customer systems and provide services or our research and development networks our backend labs and cloud stacks through which we research and develop products and services are compromised public perception of our products and services may be harmed our customers may be breached and harmed we may become subject to liability and our business operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted 

our success depends on the market’s confidence in our ability to provide effective network security protection despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal network system and website we are still vulnerable to computer viruses breakins phishing attacks attempts to overload our servers with denialofservice and other cyberattacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our internal network system or our website our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance or otherwise which breaches may be more difficult to detect than outsider threats and the existing programs and trainings we have in place to prevent such insider threats may not be effective or sufficient third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to transfer funds or disclose information in order to gain access to our network and confidential information third parties may also send our customers or others malware or malicious emails that falsely indicate that we are the source potentially causing lost confidence in us and reputational harm we cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to protect our network and website will provide adequate security moreover because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers and any security breaches and other security incidents involving us may result in more harm to our reputation and brand than companies that do not sell network security solutions hackers and malicious parties may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products and customers that impersonate our update servers in an effort to access customer networks and negatively impact customers or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees customers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our internal network system or data for example as we previously announced in the second quarter of 2019 we discovered that an unauthorized party targeted us using sophisticated techniques such as efforts to impersonate our firewall update servers in order to try to gain access to certain of our customers’ systems although based on our investigation of this incident we do not believe that it had a material impact on our or our customers’ businesses and in general we take numerous measures and implement multiple layers of security to protect our network and our customers’ networks and in this particular case we took immediate additional action to protect our customers we cannot guarantee that our security products and services will prevent all threats further we cannot be sure that third parties have not been or will not in the future be successful in improperly accessing our system and our customers’ systems which could negatively impact us and our customers an actual or perceived breach or any other actual or perceived data security incident that involves our network systems or website andor our customers’ network systems or websites including the specific matter that is discussed above could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services and investor confidence in our company any breach of our network system or website could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to our endcustomers lead to interruptions or system slowdowns cause loss of critical data or lead to the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential proprietary or sensitive information we could also be subject to liability and litigation and reputational harm and our channel partners and endcustomers may be harmed lose confidence in us and decrease or cease using our products and services any breach of our internal network system or our website could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and stock price 

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter we implemented a cloudbased quoting tool to help provide our sales team with the ability to have faster quote generation reduce quote errors and increase sales productivity our ability to integrate the data from this tool into our order processing may cause order processing delays that could have an effect on our financial results our billings and revenue for any quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason or our ability to fulfill orders at the end of any quarter is hindered for any reason including among others 



 

 

 

 

 

 

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products and to improve lead generation and sales enablement our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large businesses service provider and government organization market we have historically had relatively low spending on marketing activities while we have increased our investments in sales and marketing it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased revenue if our investments in additional sales personnel or our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market awareness of our company and products or increasing lead generation or if we experience turnover and disruption in our sales and marketing teams we will not be able to achieve sustained growth and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners for substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results may be harmed additionally a small number of distributors represents a large percentage of our revenue and gross accounts receivable and one distributor accounted for 36 of our total net accounts receivable as of december 31 2019 

  

a significant portion of our sales is generated through a limited number of distributors and substantially all of our revenue is from sales by our channel partners including distributors and resellers we depend on our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities and to manage our sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our products or our channel partners shift focus to other vendors andor our competitors our ability to sell our products and operating results may be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them with selling our products and incentivize them to sell our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services and may purchase more inventory than they can sell our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions moreover many of our channel partners are privately held including our largest distributor exclusive networks and we may not have sufficient information to assess their financial condition if our channel partners’ financial condition or operations weaken their ability to sell our product and services could be negatively impacted our channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products or may decide to cease selling our products and services altogether in favor of a competitor’s products and services they may also have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot ensure that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results 

in addition a small number of channel partners represents a large percentage of our revenue and gross accounts receivable we are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of some of our channel partners and to credit exposure in weakened markets which could result in material losses our dependence on a limited number of key channel partners means that our billings revenue and operating results may be harmed by the inability of these key channel partners to successfully sell our products and services or if any of these key channel partners is unable or unwilling to pay us terminates its relationship with us or goes out of business although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate credit and liquidity risks we cannot guarantee these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks if we are unable to adequately control these risks our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed if channel partners fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or we are otherwise unable to collect on our accounts receivable from these channel partners we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts including litigation our channel partners may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief and fail to pay amounts due to us or pay those amounts more slowly either of which could adversely affect our operating results financial position and cash flow we may be further impacted by consolidation of our existing channel partners in such instances we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be more limited we may also become increasingly dependent on a more limited number of channel partners as consolidation increases the relative proportion of our business for which each channel partner is responsible which may magnify the risks described in the preceding paragraphs 

for example in july 2017 exclusive  which distributes our solutions to a large group of resellers and endcustomers acquired fine tec us since the acquisition of fine tec us exclusive ’s business with us has increased and may continue to increase in the future 

exclusive accounted for 36 and 38 of our total net accounts receivable as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively during 2017 2018 and 2019 exclusive accounted for 25  30 and 31 of our total revenue respectively in addition to other risks associated with the concentration of accounts receivable and revenue from these distributors exclusive is a private entity and we may not have sufficient information to assess its financial condition and accordingly if exclusive were to experience financial difficulties we might not have advance notice additionally exclusive may face liquidity risk as a private equitybacked company which may harm our ability to collect on our accounts receivable 

in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to detect or prevent a security breach or the misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins cause them to fail to help secure our customers or cause our products or services to allow unauthorized access to our customers’ networks we are also susceptible to errors defects vulnerabilities or attacks that may arise at or be inserted into our products in different stages in our supply chain or manufacturing processes and which are out of our control attacks may target specific unidentified or unresolved vulnerabilities that exist or arrive only in the supply chain making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against different customers deploy and use our products in different ways and certain deployments and usages may subject our products to adverse conditions that may negatively impact the effectiveness and useful lifetime of our products our networks and products including cloudbased technology could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation we cannot ensure that our products will prevent all security threats because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard security subscription or forticare updates or our fortigate appliances and operating systems could result in a failure of our fortiguard security subscription services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortigate appliances and cloudbased products and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates 

or fail to meet the increased requirements of our customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products and services and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized third party any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not appropriately manage any future growth including through the expansion of our real estate facilities or are unable to improve our systems processes and controls our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

we rely heavily on information technology to help manage critical functions such as order configuration pricing and quoting revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews in addition we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on manual data entry of customer purchase orders received through email and to a lesser extent through electronic data interchange from our customers due to the use of manual processes and the fact that we may receive a large amount of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter an interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased billings and revenue for that quarter 

to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial operating security and administrative systems and controls and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and processes we must also continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems controls and processes such as system capacity access security and change management controls in a timely or efficient manner our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner whether as a result of the significant growth of our business or otherwise may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses moreover the failure of our systems and processes could undermine our ability to provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results and could impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

in addition our systems processes and controls may not prevent or detect all errors omissions malfeasance or fraud such as corruption and improper “side agreements” that may impact revenue recognition or result in financial liability our productivity and the quality of our products and services may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to ensure appropriate systems processes and controls and to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our reputation and results of operations 

we have expanded our office real estate holdings to meet our projected growing need for office space we have started construction on a second building adjacent to our headquarters as we expand our campus in sunnyvale california these plans will require significant capital expenditure over the next several years and involve certain risks including impairment charges and acceleration of depreciation changes in future business strategy that may decrease the need for expansion such as a decrease in headcount and risks related to construction future changes in growth or fluctuations in cash flow may also negatively impact our ability to pay for these projects or free cash flow additionally inaccuracies in our projected capital expenditures could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

  

we may experience difficulties maintaining and expanding our internal business management systems 

  

the maintenance of our internal business management systems such as our enterprise resource planning “erp” and customer relationship management “crm” systems has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources in addition we may choose to upgrade or expand the functionality of our internal systems leading to additional costs we may also discover deficiencies in our design or maintenance of our internal systems that could adversely affect our ability to forecast orders process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations accurately maintain books and records provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business additionally if any of our internal systems does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed further we may expand the scope of our erp and crm systems our operating results may be adversely affected if these upgrades or expansions are delayed or if the systems do not function as intended or are not sufficient to meet our operating requirements 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition deferred contract costs and commission expense valuation of inventory accounting for business combination contingent liabilities and accounting for income taxes 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners including manufacturers with facilities located in taiwan china and other countries outside the united states such as microstar wistron senao adlink and ibase our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers in asia and elsewhere reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance costs supply and timing and possible tariffs any manufacturing disruption related to our thirdparty manufacturers or their component suppliers for any reason including natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes fires 

power outages typhoons floods health pandemics and epidemics such as the coronavirus and manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars and critical infrastructure attacks could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production or shipping interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages quality problems or strike or other labor disruption at one of our manufacturing partners or locations or at shipping ports or locations would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary spu s which are key to the performance of our appliances are built by contract manufacturers including renesas and toshiba these contract manufacturers use foundries operated by tsmc or renesas on a purchaseorder basis and these foundries do not guarantee their capacity and could delay orders or increase their pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer inventory shortages of our spu as well as increased costs in addition to our proprietary spu  we also purchase offtheshelf asic s or integrated circuits from vendors for which we have experienced and may continue to experience long lead times our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes or more profitable products if any of these manufacturers materially delays its supply of asic s or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asic s our business would be harmed 

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances directive the “ eu rohs ” adopted in the european union the “ eu ” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals” that are contained in our products have originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “ doddfrank ” the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to efforts to determine the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements which would make it more difficult to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage cause loss of sales and customers or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers may discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of cpus from intel network chips from broadcom marvell and intel and memory devices from intel adata toshiba samsung and western 

digital we also may face shortages in the supply of the capacitors and resistors that are used in the manufacturing of our products the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and health emergencies such as earthquakes fires power outages typhoons floods health pandemics and epidemics such as the coronavirus and manmade events such as civil unrest labor disruption international trade disputes international conflicts terrorism wars critical infrastructure attacks and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

 

   

   

   

   

   

 

   

the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro brazilian real canadian dollar and british pound additionally fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar may negatively impact our development plans in burnaby canada while we are not currently engaged in material hedging activities we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts through the use of forward exchange contracts if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currencydenominated operating expenses in addition a strengthening of the us dollar may increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose endcustomers in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state regional local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety product labeling environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws data privacy laws import and export controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be 

more stringent than in the united states noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations sanctions enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

for example the gdpr which became effective in may 2018 and superseded current eu data protection regulations imposes stringent data handling requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the eu noncompliance with the gdpr could result in significant penalties including data protection audits and heavy fines compliance with and the other burdens imposed by the gdpr may limit our ability to operate or expand our business in europe and could adversely impact our operating results as could delays or shortcomings in the implementation of our gdpr compliance program 

additionally we may be subject to other legal regimes throughout the world governing data handling protection and privacy for example in june 2018 california passed the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies and became effective on january 1 2020 fines for noncompliance may be up to 7500 per violation the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by the gdpr and ccpa may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business 

selling our solutions to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements and risks failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government or one of its divisions and other penalties and damages which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and prospects as an example the us department of justice the “doj” has in the past pursued claims against and obtained monetary settlements or damages from companies including us under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing discount practices and compliance with laws related to sales to the federal government such as the trade agreements act the “taa” the doj continues to actively pursue such claims any violations of regulatory and contractual requirements could result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our revenue operating results financial condition and prospects 

these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements including noncompliance in the past could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners penalties termination of contracts loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting any such damages penalties disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

global economic uncertainty and weakening product demand caused by political instability and conflict could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

economic uncertainty in various global markets caused by political instability and conflict has resulted and may continue to result in weakened demand for our products and services and difficulty in forecasting our financial results and managing inventory levels political developments impacting government spending and international trade including potential government shutdowns and election year instability in the united states continued uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom’s departure from the eu and trade disputes and tariffs may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions the effects of these events may continue due to potential additional us government shutdowns and developments resulting from the 2020 presidential election instability in the united kingdom and the eu as negotiations for the terms of brexit continue with the ultimate outcome still uncertain and the united states’ ongoing trade disputes with china and other countries the continuing effect of any or all of these events could adversely impact demand for our products harm our operations and weaken our financial results 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales and that could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the united states only with the required export license or through an export license exception or may be prohibited altogether from export to certain countries if we were to fail to comply with us export laws us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we 

could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits eg for stocking orders placed by our partners we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements to change tax provisions related to global manufacturing and sales or to impose new tariffs economic sanctions or related legislation any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business benefits directly and indirectly from free trade agreements and we also rely on various us corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we develop market and sell our products and services globally efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements or to change corporate tax policy related to international commerce could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as could the continuing uncertainty regarding whether such actions will be taken 

moreover efforts to implement changes related to export or import regulations including the imposition of new border taxes or tariffs on foreign imports trade barriers economic sanctions and other related policies could harm our results of operations for example during 2018 and 2019 the united states imposed additional import tariffs on certain goods from different countries and on most of chinese imported goods as a result china and other countries imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods exported from the united states and both the united states and foreign countries have threatened to alter or leave current trade agreements while we do not currently expect these tariffs to have a significant effect on our raw material and product import costs if the united states expands increased tariffs or retaliatory trade measures are taken by china or other countries in response to the tariffs the cost of our products could increase our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to raise our prices which may result in the loss of customers and harm to our reputation and operating performance 

any modification in these areas any shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or any change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential endcustomers with international operations and could result in increased costs any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products laws relating to our real property and future expansion plans and laws concerning the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs directive eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban or restrict the presence of certain hazardous substances such as lead mercury cadmium hexavalent chromium and certain fireretardant plastic additives in electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off scrapped noncompliant inventory we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on exemptions for lead and other substances in network infrastructure equipment it is possible one or more of these use exemptions will be revoked in the future additionally although some of the eu rohs exemptions have been extended it is possible that some of these exemptions may expire in the future without being extended if this exemption is revoked or expires without extension if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us andor disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to government organizations sales to government organizations are subject to a number of risks selling to government organizations can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense with long sales cycles and without any assurance of winning a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

 

 

 

 

the rules and regulations applicable to sales to government organizations may also negatively impact sales to other organizations to date we have had limited traction in sales to us federal government agencies and any future sales to government organizations is uncertain government organizations may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such government organization the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate review and audit government vendors’ administrative and other processes and any unfavorable investigation audit or other review could result in the government’s refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the investigation audit or other review uncovers improper illegal or otherwise concerning activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

false detection of vulnerabilities viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

our fortiguard security subscription services may falsely detect report and act on viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our fortiguard security subscription services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures in addition our threat researchers periodically identify vulnerabilities in various thirdparty products and if these identifications are perceived to be incorrect or are in fact incorrect this could harm our business any such false identification or perceived false identification of important files applications or vulnerabilities could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer highquality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners and other third parties to resolve any issues relating to our products if we our channel partners or other third parties do not effectively assist our customers in planning deploying and operational proficiency for our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many large endcustomers and service provider or government organization endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers because of their more complex deployments and more demanding environments and business models if we our channel partners or other third parties fail to meet the requirements of our larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with large businesses service providers and government organizations our failure to maintain highquality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to litigation reputational damage loss of customers and additional costs 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of our subsidiaries are organized our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control these include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have open tax years that could be subject to the examination by the internal revenue service the “irs” and other tax authorities we currently have ongoing tax audits in the united kingdom canada and several other foreign jurisdictions the focus of all of these audits is the allocation of profit between our legal entities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results 

on june 7 2019 the ninth circuit issued an opinion in altera corporation and subsidiaries vs commissioner of internal revenue that reversed the tax court decision in favor of the irs this ruling stated the irs rule that stock compensation must be included in cost sharing was valid based on this decision in second quarter of 2019 we recorded a reserve for uncertain tax positions for this potential tax liability on february 10 2020 the ninth circuit decision was appealed to the supreme court of the united states we will continue to monitor and assess the impact as this case moves forward 

we may undertake corporate operating restructurings or transfers of assets that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad in order to maximize the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure if ineffectual such restructurings or transfers could increase our income tax liabilities and in turn increase our global effective tax rate moreover our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner that we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws however the tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates in a given jurisdiction differs from our estimate our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations additionally our actual tax rate may be subject to further uncertainty due to potential changes in us and foreign tax rules 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently tax authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” an international association comprised of 36 countries including the united states has issued and continues to issue guidelines and proposals that change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business due to our extensive international business activities any changes in the taxation of such activities could increase our tax obligations in many countries and may increase our worldwide effective tax rate 

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products technologies or intellectual property such as patents for example we closed our acquisitions of ensilo and cybersponse in the fourth quarter of 2019 for any possible future acquisitions we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition or financing the acquisition for both our prior and future acquisitions we may not be successful in effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property and sales force into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines integrating reporting systems and procedures and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies for example we may experience difficulties integrating an acquired company’s erp or crm systems sales support and other processes and systems with our current systems and processes our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property could significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance and effectiveness of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us result in litigation and disputes with customers and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to litigation litigation costs and liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims if exceptions apply or if the provisions are deemed unenforceable and in some circumstances we may be required to indemnify a customer in full without limitation for certain liabilities including liabilities that are not contractually limited the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us if at all and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

  

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages typhoon floods virus outbreaks and other broad healthrelated challenges and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest labor disruption critical infrastructure attack and terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire power outage flood viral outbreak or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity and our research and development and data center in burnaby canada from which we deliver to customers our fortiguard security subscription updates is subject to the risk of flooding and is also in a region known for seismic activity any earthquake in the bay area or burnaby or 

flooding in burnaby could materially negatively impact our ability to provide products and services such as forticare support and fortiguard subscription services and could otherwise materially negatively impact our business in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products or performing or assisting with shipments on a timely basis as well as our customers’ ability to order from us and our employees’ ability to perform their duties for example a typhoon in taiwan could materially negatively impact our ability to ship products and could result in delays in billings and revenues and the coronavirus outbreak could materially negatively impact our ability to manufacture and ship products in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in our missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability civil unrest labor disruptions acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or of the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at the end of each quarter any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results to the extent that any of the above results in security risks to our customers delays or cancellations of customer orders the delay of the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products or interruption or downtime of our services our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects may be harmed 

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and timeconsuming research and development processes for example we enter into development agreements with third parties if our contract development projects are not successfully completed or are not completed in a timely fashion our product development could be delayed and our business generally could suffer costs for contract development can be substantial and our profitability may be harmed if we are unable to recover these costs although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

moreover business models based on saas either hosted or cloudbased services have become increasingly indemand by our endcustomers and adopted by other providers including our competitors while we have introduced additional cloudbased products and services and will continue to do so most of our platform is currently deployed on premise and therefore if customers demand that our platform be provided through a saas business model we would be required to make additional investments in our infrastructure and personnel to be able to more fully provide our platform through a saas model in order to maintain the competitiveness of our platform such investments may involve expanding our data centers servers and networks and increasing our technical operations and engineering teams these risks are compounded by the uncertainty concerning the future viability of saas business models and the future demand for such models by customers additionally if we are unable to meet the demand to provide our services through a saas model we may lose customers to competitors 

our uniform resource locator “url” database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’ expectations 

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are 

available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations could impair the growth of our business 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to acquire and develop internally new products and enhanced versions of our existing products in order to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

demand for our products may be limited by market perception that individual products from one vendor that provide multiple layers of security protection in one product are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of many of our products depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality into one appliance if the market for these products fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view “allinone” network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that such products of ours provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform our solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of our product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that “allinone” solutions may be suitable only for small and mediumsized businesses because such solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large businesses service provider and government organization endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with our market in general demand for multisecurity functionality products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future we face many competitors across the different cybersecurity markets our competitors include companies such as barracuda  check point  cisco  crowdstrike  f5 networks  fireeye  forcepoint  imperva  juniper  mcafee  palo alto networks  proofpoint  sonicwall  sophos  trend micro and zscaler  

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize 

in providing protection from a single type of security threat are often able to deliver these specialized security products to the market more quickly than we can 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services and leverage new business models that are equal or superior to ours achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do for example certain of our competitors are focusing on delivering security services from the cloud in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions as a result of such acquisitions competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services as our customers refresh the security products bought in prior years they may seek to consolidate vendors which may result in current customers choosing to purchase products from our competitors on an ongoing basis due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco f5 networks and juniper offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from time to time legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license the gnu lesser public license the bsd license the apache license the mit x license and the mozilla public license from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as for example open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that for example could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which requirements could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties are currently asserting have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us third parties have also asserted such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we may indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies nonpracticing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or 

copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes as well as general commercial litigation and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion 

we have several ongoing patent lawsuits certain companies have sent us demand letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and organizations have sent letters demanding that we provide indemnification for patent claims as two examples of the ongoing patent lawsuits against us one such patent lawsuit by british telecommunications plc was filed in federal court in delaware in july 2018 and a second such lawsuit by finjan inc was filed in federal court in california in october 2018 and additional patent lawsuits have been filed against us since given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities and recent nonpracticing entity and operating entity patent litigation against other companies in the security space we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any settlement payment or adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products licensors may claim we owe them additional license fees for past and future use of their software and other intellectual property or that we cannot utilize such software or intellectual property in our products going forward there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or for reasonable pricing or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may result in significant license fees and have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

we also rely on technologies licensed from third parties in order to operate functions of our business if any of these third parties allege that we have not properly paid for such licenses or that we have improperly used the technologies under such licenses we may need to pay additional fees or obtain new licenses and such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all or may be costly in any such case or if we were required to redesign our internal operations to function with new technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sarbanesoxley” doddfrank and other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these requirements as well as proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations sarbanesoxley requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly although our most recent assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2019 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2020 or future periods we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

in september 2018 california enacted a law that requires publicly held companies headquartered in california to have at least one female director by the end of 2019 and at least three by the end of 2021 depending on the size of the board the law would impose financial penalties for failure to comply though we are currently in compliance with the requirements of the law for 2019 we may incur costs associated with complying with the law in future years including costs associated with expanding our board of directors or identifying qualified candidates for appointment to our board of directors or financial penalties or harm to our brand and reputation if we are unable to do so 

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing or new accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition which became effective for us on january 1 2018 and accounting for leases which became effective for us on january 1 2019 as well as the significant costs incurred or that may be incurred to adopt and to comply with these new pronouncements could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which could have an adverse effect on our business our ability to meet our reporting obligations and compliance with internal control requirements 

the revenue and lease standards are principles based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances management will continue to make judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of the new standard it is possible that interpretation industry practice and guidance may evolve as we work toward implementing the new revenue recognition standard if our circumstances change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions our operating result may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock further equity investments are now required to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income which may increase the volatility of our earnings 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report news about us and our financial results news about our competitors and their results and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us for example during 2019 the closing price of our common stock ranged from 6691 to 10953 per share 

furthermore stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

share repurchases under our repurchase program the “repurchase program” could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock could diminish our cash reserves could occur at nonoptimal prices and may not result in the most effective use of our capital 

in november 2019 our board of directors approved a 10 billion increase in the authorized stock repurchase under the repurchase program and extended the term of the repurchase program to february 28 2021 bringing the aggregate amount authorized to be repurchased 25 billion as of december 31 2019 16 billion remained available for future share repurchases under the repurchase program share repurchases under the repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock increase stock price volatility and diminish our cash reserves in addition an announcement of the reduction suspension or termination of the repurchase program could result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock moreover our stock price could decline resulting in repurchases made at nonoptimal prices our failure to repurchase our stock at optimal prices may be perceived by investors as an inefficient use of our cash and cash equivalents which could result in litigation that may have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition while our board of directors carefully considers various alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents in determining whether to authorize stock repurchases there can be no assurance that the decision by our board of directors to repurchase stock would result in the most effective uses of our cash and cash equivalents and there may be alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents that would be more effective such as investing in growing our business organically or through acquisitions 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

however these antitakeover provisions will not have the effect of preventing activist stockholders from seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as nominating board candidates and requesting that we pursue strategic combinations or other transactions these actions could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result 

of activist stockholder actions could result in the loss of potential business opportunities as well as other negative business consequences actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect our business further we may incur significant expenses in retaining professionals to advise and assist us on activist stockholder matters including legal financial communications advisors and solicitation experts which may negatively impact our future financial results

financial highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our revenue growth was driven by both product and service revenue on a geographic basis revenue continues to be diversified globally which remains a key strength of our business product revenue grew 17 in 2019 we experienced revenue growth across several of our hardware and software products including fortigate enabled with sdwan features service revenue growth of 21 in 2019 was driven by the strength of our fortiguard and other security subscription revenue which grew 24  

  

during the second quarter of 2019 we reclassified the 100 series of our fortigate product from an entrylevel product to a midrange product prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation including this reclassification we saw a mix shift from highend to midrange products in 2019 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we acquired ensilo limited “ensilo” and cybersponse inc “cybersponse” to further strengthen our fortinet security fabric platform by providing realtime automated endpoint detection and response capability ensilo and security orchestration automation and response products and services cybersponse the impact of these acquisitions individually and in the aggregate were not material to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in 2019  our revenue growth outpaced our growth in operating expenses as a result operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by two percentage points compared to 2018  headcount increased by 21 to 7082 employees and contractors as of december 31 2019 up from 5845 as of december 31 2018 the acquisition of ensilo and cybersponse increased headcount by 135 employees excluding these two acquisitions headcount would have increased 19 year over year 

the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on our business remains uncertain and though the majority of our products are manufactured outside of china certain components for our products and certain of our products are manufactured in china and taiwan and we have international shipping and logistics centers in taiwan while any significant impact is uncertain at this point if the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread the business disruption caused thereby could have a material negative impact on our billings revenue gross margin operating margin cash flows and other financial results for the first quarter of 2020 and certain periods thereafter 

business model 

we primarily sell our products and services through a twotier distribution model we sell to distributors that sell to networking security and enterprisefocused resellers and to service providers and mssps  who in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to large service providers and major systems integrators in certain cases we sell directly to large service providers and major systems integrators we also offer our products across major cloud providers and have recognized ondemand revenue from amazon web services microsoft azure ibm cloud google cloud and oracle cloud we have also recognized revenue from customers who deploy our products in a bringyourownlicense “ byol ” arrangement at a cloud provider such as amazon web services microsoft azure google cloud oracle cloud and alibaba cloud in a byol arrangement a customer purchases a software license from us through our channel partners and deploys the software in a cloud provider’s environment similarly customers may purchase such a license from us and deploy in their private cloud 

typically our customers purchase our hardware products and software licenses as well as our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services we generally invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and security and technical support services the invoice is typically payable within 30 to 45 days we also invoice certain services on a monthly basis 

key metrics 

we monitor a number of key metrics including the key financial metrics set forth below in order to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies the following table summarizes revenue deferred revenue billings nongaap net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow nongaap we discuss revenue below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss net cash provided by operating activities below under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue billings nongaap and free cash flow nongaap are discussed immediately below the following table 



  

deferred revenue our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unrecognized portion of service revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual service period we monitor our deferred revenue balance deferred revenue growth and the mix of shortterm and longterm deferred revenue because deferred revenue represents a significant portion of free cash flow and of revenue to be recognized in future periods deferred revenue was 214 billion as of december 31 2019  an increase of 4491 million  or 27  from december 31 2018  

billings nongaap we define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period and adjustments to the deferred revenue balance due to adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers “topic 606” less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations during the period we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings 

drive current and future revenue which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business there are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of gaap revenue first billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue and are impacted by the security and support contractual service period agreements second we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding gaap revenue and evaluating billings together with gaap revenue total billings were 260 billion for 2019 an increase of 21 compared to 215 billion in 2018 

a reconciliation of revenue the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to billings is provided below 



free cash flow nongaap we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment we believe free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after capital expenditures can be used for strategic opportunities including repurchasing outstanding common stock investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet a limitation of using free cash flow rather than the gaap measures of cash provided by or used in operating activities investing activities and financing activities is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance for the period because it excludes cash flows from investing activities other than capital expenditures and cash flows from financing activities management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the consolidated statements of cash flows and under “—liquidity and capital resources” and by presenting cash flows from investing and financing activities in our reconciliation of free cash flow in addition it is important to note that other companies including companies in our industry may not use free cash flow may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to free cash flow is provided below 



components of operating results 

revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our hardware and software products and amortization of amounts included in deferred revenue related to previous sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services we also recognize revenue from cloud security solutions professional services and training 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

 

 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

 

 

gross margin  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products product costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between hardware products software licenses and services and any excess inventory writeoffs service revenue and software licenses have had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher gross margins compared to hardware product gross margins during 2019  service gross margin benefited from renewals and continued sales of services and subscriptions growing faster than related expenses product gross margin benefited from gains in average selling price as well as lower direct and indirect product costs as a percentage of product revenue it also benefited from deal mix software revenue growth and a stable product transition environment cost of product revenue was comprised of direct product costs and indirect costs including inventory reserves and other manufacturing overhead overall gross margin in 2020 will be impacted by service and product revenue mix but we expect it to be comparable to overall gross margin in 2019 

operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries benefits bonuses stockbased compensation and sales commissions as applicable we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our workforce 

 



intend to hire additional personnel focused on sales and marketing and expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide in order to capture market share in the enterprise market 

 

interest income—net interest income—net consists of interest earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in corporate debt securities certificates of deposit and term deposits commercial paper money market funds and us government and agency securities 

other income expense — net  other income expense—net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign currency remeasurement as well as the gain on the sale of an investment in a privately held company and the impairment charge on an investment in a privately held company 

provision for benefit from income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in local countries and may be subject to us income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than in the us nondeductible stockbased compensation expense federal research and development tax credit state taxes withholding taxes excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense and the tax impacts of the 2017 tax act  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of the significant accounting policies described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

on january 1 2018 we adopted topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under topic 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under asc topic 605 “topic 605” revenue recognition 

beginning in 2018 revenues are recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services prior to 2018 revenue was recognized under topic 605 when all of the following criteria were met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii sales price was fixed or determinable and iv collectability was reasonably assured 

under topic 606 we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 



our sales contracts typically contain multiple deliverables such as hardware software license security subscription technical support services and other services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations we evaluated the criteria to be distinct under topic 606 and concluded that the hardware and software licenses were distinct and distinct in the context of a contract from the security subscription and technical support services as a customer can benefit from the hardware and software licenses without the services and the services are separately identifiable within a contract we allocate a transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price if not observable through past transactions we determine standalone selling price based on the historical pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately we determine standalone selling price for a product or service by considering multiple historical factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies and the term of a service contract that fall within a reasonably range as a percentage of list price 

under the previous standard topic 605 revenue from contracts that contain products and services is allocated to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price using vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if it existed or thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price existed for a deliverable we used our best estimate of selling price for that deliverable for multipleelement arrangements where software deliverables were included revenue was allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in an arrangement based on the estimated selling price hierarchy the amount allocated to the software deliverables was then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when vsoe of fair value existed if evidence of vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements did not exist all software allocated revenue was deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurred or when fair value was established when the undelivered element for which we did not have vsoe of fair value was support revenue for the entire arrangement was recognized ratably over the support period the same residual method and vsoe of fair value principles applied for our multiple element arrangements that contained only software elements 

deferred contract costs and commission expense 

beginning in 2018 we recognized commission expense based on topic 606’s guidance for contract costs under this new guidance we recognize sales commissions related to product sales upfront while sales commissions for service contracts are deferred as deferred contract costs in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the applicable amortization period costs for initial contracts that are not commensurate with renewal commissions are amortized on a straightline basis over the period of benefit which we have determined to be five years and which is typically longer than the initial contract term significant estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for deferred contract costs include but are not limited to identification of contract costs anticipated billings and the expected period of benefit 

valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using the firstin firstout method in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

business combinations 

we include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill we often continue to gather additional information throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded such changes are recorded in the period in which they are identified 

contingent liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in disputes litigation and other legal actions however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other thirdparty claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations we review significant new claims and litigation for the probability of an adverse outcome estimates can change as individual 

claims develop the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in addition deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of the position that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

effective january 1 2018 the 2017 tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax our selection of an accounting policy for 2018 with respect to the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” tax rules was to treat gilti tax as a current period expense under the period cost method for 2019 we were not subject to gilti we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the 2017 tax act and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations issued in response to the 2017 tax act 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of income become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets would be recorded in the consolidated statements of income for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required

discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2018 as compared to 2017 can be found in item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 filed with the sec on february 27 2019 

2019 and 2018 

revenue 



total revenue increased by 3550 million  or 20  in 2019 compared to 2018  we continued to experience diversification of revenue globally and across both customer and industry segments revenue from all regions grew with the americas contributing the largest portion of our revenue growth on an absolute dollar basis 

product revenue increased by 1141 million  or 17  in 2019 compared to 2018  we experienced revenue growth across many of our hardware and software products due to an increase in product revenue from our sdwan fortigate solutions and growth in sales of our infrastructure security solutions 

service revenue increased by 2409 million  or 21  in 2019 compared to 2018  fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support and other revenues increased by 1448 million or 24 and by 961 million or 18 respectively in 2019 compared to 2018  the increases were primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance related to fortiguard and other security subscriptions and forticare technical support and other contracts of the service revenue recognized in 2019  68 was included in the deferred revenue balance as of december 31 2018 of the service revenue recognized in 2018  67 was included in the deferred revenue balance as of december 31 2017 

cost of revenue and gross margin 



total gross margin increased by 15 percentage points in 2019 compared to 2018  driven by improvements to both product and service gross margins product gross margin increased by 19 percentage points in 2019 compared to 2018  product gross margin benefited from gains in average selling price as well as lower direct and indirect product costs as a percentage of product revenue it also benefited from deal mix software revenue growth and a stable product transition environment cost of 

product revenue was comprised primarily of thirdparty contract manufacturers’ costs and the costs of materials used in production service gross margin increased by 08 percentage points in 2019 compared to 2018  as our service revenue growth outpaced our growth in related personnel costs cost of service revenue was comprised primarily of personnel costs 

operating expenses 



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 326 million  or 13  in 2019 compared to 2018  primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 299 million as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements to our existing products we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization and expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2020 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 1446 million  or 18  in 2019 compared to 2018  primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 1039 million as a result of increases to sales and marketing headcount in order to drive global market share gains in addition marketing expenses increased by 168 million we intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure and marketing strategy which are critical to support growth and expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2020 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 91 million  or 10  in 2019 compared to 2018  primarily due to an increase in personnelrelated costs of 61 million and an increase in litigation costs of 31 million certain facilities depreciation and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2020 

operating income and margin 

we generated operating income of 3442 million in 2019  an increase of 1132 million  or 49  compared to 2310 million in 2018  operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 16 in 2019 compared to 13 in 2018 the increase in operating margin is primarily due to the improvement in gross margin by 15 percentage points in addition as a percent of total revenue research and development expense decreased by 07 percentage points sales and marketing expense decreased by 04 percentage points and general and administrative expense decreased by 04 percentage points 

  

interest income—net and other expense — net 



interest income—net increased in 2019 as compared to 2018  primarily due to higher interest rates and to a lesser extent higher invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments interest income—net varies depending on our average investment balances during the period types and mix of investments and market interest rates the change in other expense—net in 2019 as compared to 2018 was the result of a 38 million impairment charge on an investment in a privately held company during 2019 compared to a 22 million gain on the sale of an investment in a privately held company in the same period last year partially offset by 35 million decrease in foreign currency exchange losses 

provision for benefit from income taxes 



our provision for income taxes for 2019 reflects an effective tax rate of 14  compared to an effective tax rate benefit of 32 for 2018  the provision for income taxes for 2019 was comprised primarily of an 888 million tax expense related to us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes and a 101 million tax expense for an unrecognized tax benefit related to the ninth circuit’s opinion in altera corporation and subsidiaries vs commissioner of internal revenue “ altera ” the provision was partially offset by excess tax benefits of 393 million from stockbased compensation expense and tax benefits of 68 million from federal research and development tax credits 

in 2018 our effective tax rate benefit of 32 was comprised primarily of impacts related to the 2017 tax act including a benefit of 1640 million from the realignment of our tax structure and operations that resulted in a booktotax basis difference from previously taxed offshore deferred revenue these benefits were partially offset by a 326 million increase in the transition tax for finalization of the provisional estimates under staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act 205 million of tax expense for the impact of the gilti and 296 million of tax expense related to us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes and a decrease in tax reserves 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of income data for the last eight quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period 



  

1 includes stockbased compensation as follows 



2 total amortization included in product costs service costs and sales and marketing expense are as follows 



seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend which has positively impacted billings and product revenue activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential customer buying followed by an increase in buying in the second quarter the third quarter is often consistent with the second quarter although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

consistent with the seasonality note above our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has generally increased sequentially in each quarter except in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 product revenue in each quarter in 2019  increased as compared to the same quarter in 2018  which we believe was due to investments we made in our sales and marketing organizations continued product innovation and a robust security market we continue to see a shift from product revenue to highermargin recurring service revenue 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to seasonality of product sales and seasonality of cost increases product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products in 2019 product gross margin was impacted by new product introductions and the mix of highend midrange and entrylevel products service gross margin benefited from the growth of our customer base and renewals 

liquidity and capital resources 



liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as by our stock repurchases proceeds associated with stock option exercises issuances of common stock under our equity incentive plans and payment of taxes in connection with the net settlement of equity awards real estate and other capital expenditures and business acquisitions 

in recent years we have received significant capital resources from billings the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan “ espp ” purchases additional increases in billings may depend on a number of factors including demand for our products and services competition market or industry changes and our ability to execute we expect 

proceeds from the exercise of stock options in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units versus stock options granted and also to vary based on our share price there will not be future proceeds from purchases under our espp which was terminated in february 2019 as of december 31 2019 16 billion remained available for future share repurchases under the repurchase program 

construction of a second building at our headquarters campus started in the fourth quarter of 2018 and related spending will continue in 2020 and until project completion we estimate 2020 real estate spending including the headquarters campus project to be between 1500 million and 1600 million dollars 

as of december 31 2019  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 221 billion were invested primarily in deposit accounts money market funds corporate debt securities commercial paper certificates of deposit and term deposits and us government and agency securities it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital provides liquidity and generates return without significantly increasing risk we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments held by our international subsidiaries was 1093 million as of december 31 2019 and 9566 million as of december 31 2018 the decrease in cash cash equivalents and investments held by our international subsidiaries related to changes in our international tax structure 

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and amount of our share repurchases the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the continuing market acceptance of our products and our investments in purchasing or leasing real estate historically we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisition activities in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 

operating activities 

cash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity it is primarily comprised of net income as adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash adjustments consist primarily of stockbased compensation amortization of deferred contract costs and depreciation and amortization changes in operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of changes in deferred revenue deferred contract costs accounts receivable and inventory 

  

our operating activities during 2019 provided 8080 million in cash as a result of the continued growth of our business and our ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue our total deferred revenue balance grew 4491 million  or 27  during 2019 

our operating activities during 2018 provided 6389 million in cash as a result of the continued growth of our business and our ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue our total deferred revenue balance as of december 31 2018 of 169 billion represented a 26 increase year over year 

investing activities 

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments and purchases of property and equipment historically in making a lease versus purchase decision related to our larger facilities we have considered various factors including financial metrics and the impact on our employees in certain cases we have elected to purchase the facility if we believed that purchasing rather than leasing is more in line with our longterm strategy we expect to make similar decisions in the future we may also make cash payments in connection with future business combinations 

during 2019 cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by 3755 million expended on purchases of investments net of maturities and sales of investments 922 million spent on purchases of property and equipment and 346 million used for the acquisitions of ensilo and cybersponse  net of cash acquired 

during 2018 cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 602 million spent for purchases of our investments net of maturities and sales of investments 530 million spent on capital expenditures and 217 million used for the acquisitions of bradford networks inc and zonefox limited net of cash acquired 

financing activities 

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to repurchase and retirement of common stock proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and payments of debt assumed in business combinations 

during 2019 cash used in financing activities was 1956 million  primarily due to 1451 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock 465 million used to pay tax withholding net of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and 37 million of payments of the debt assumed in business combinations 

during 2018 cash used in financing activities was 2026 million primarily due to 2118 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock and 101 million of payments of the debt assumed in business combinations this was partially offset by 193 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of tax withholding 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following summarizes our inventory purchase commitments as of december 31 2019  

  



  

 

in addition to commitments with contract manufacturers we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services as of december 31 2019  we had 128 million in other contractual commitments having a remaining term in excess of one year that may not be cancelable 

as of december 31 2019  we had 828 million of longterm income tax liabilities including interest related to uncertain tax positions because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during 2019  2018 and 2017  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities including corporate debt securities certificates of deposit and term deposits commercial paper money market funds and us government and agency securities the risk 

associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2019  2018 and 2017 would have resulted in an insignificant decrease in our interest income in each of these periods 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the united states are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar “cad” the brazilian real “brl” the euro “eur” and the british pound “gbp” to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to minimize the impact of balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the credit worthiness of these parties these contracts typically have a maturity of one month and settle on the last day of each month we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts in other income expense—net in the consolidated statements of income we recognized an expense of 47 million in 2019 due to foreign currency transaction losses 

our use of forward exchange contracts is intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements our forward exchange contracts are relatively shortterm in nature and are focused on the cad longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar against other foreign currencies such as the eur brl and gbp could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 56 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash balances as of december 31 2019 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are predominantly shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

manufacturing and suppliers 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers our current manufacturing partners include adlink technology inc ibase technology inc “ibase” microstar international co “microstar” senao networks inc “senao” wistron corporation “wistron” and a number of other manufacturers the majority of our hardware is manufactured in taiwan with some products manufactured in the united states or china we submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured the delivery date and other delivery terms once our products are manufactured they are sent to either our warehouse in california or to our logistics partner in taoyuan city taiwan where accessory packaging and qualitycontrol testing are performed we believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to focus resources on our core competencies our proprietary spus which are the key to the performance of our appliances are built by contract manufacturers including faraday technology corporation “faraday” kawasaki microelectronics america inc and renesas electronics corporation “renesas” these contract manufacturers use foundries operated by either united microelectronics corporation “umc” or taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited “tsmc” or their own foundry such as renesas’ fab 

the components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or more frequently by our contract manufacturers some of the components important to our business including certain cpus from intel corporation “intel” network chips from broadcom inc “broadcom” marvell technology group ltd “marvell” and intel and memory devices from intel adata technology co ltd “adata” ocz technology group inc “ocz” samsung electronics co ltd “samsung” and western digital technologies inc “western digital” are available from limited or sole sources of supply 

we have no longterm contracts related to the manufacturing of our asics or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms 

research and development 

we focus our research and development efforts on developing new hardware and software products and services and adding new features to existing products and services our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that are or are expected to be important to our endcustomers our success in designing developing manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors including identification of market demand for new products product selection timely implementation of product design and development product performance costs of development bills of materials effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing 

intellectual property 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology as of december 31 2018  we had 596 us and foreignissued patents and 199 pending us and foreign patent applications we also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms 

despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights third parties have asserted are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected in certain instances we indemnify our endcustomers distributors and resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties

seasonality 

for information regarding seasonality in our sales see the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—quarterly results of operations—seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance throughput features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

• addition and integration of new networking and security features and technological expertise 

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

• brand recognition 

• customer service and support across varied and complex customer segments 

• sales and distribution capabilities 

• size and financial stability and 

• breadth of product line 

among others our competitors include check point software technologies ltd “check point” cisco systems inc “cisco” f5 networks inc “f5 networks” fireeye inc “fireeye” forcepoint llc “forcepoint” imperva inc “imperva” juniper networks inc “juniper” mcafee llc “mcafee” palo alto networks inc “palo alto networks” proofpoint inc “proofpoint” sonicwall inc “sonicwall” sophos group plc “sophos” and trend micro incorporated “trend micro” 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance throughput reliability breadth and ability to work together our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionalities to our products 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance are better marketed or achieve greater market acceptance than our products additionally our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are better positioned to withstand a significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  our total headcount was 5845  employees and contractors none of our us employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in certain european countries have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain uptodate union membership we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors may lose some or all of their investment 

risks related to our business   

our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control or may be difficult to predict including 

  

 

   

   

 

   

 

   

 

 

 

   

   

   

   

   

 9 

   

   

 

 

 

   

   

 

   

   

 

 

 

 

   

   

   

 



 10 

 

 

 

 

 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature over the near term accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global and regional economic conditions and spending environments geopolitical instability and uncertainty weak economic conditions in certain regions or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could have adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our channel partners reduced unit sales and slower or declining growth 

our billings revenue operating margin and free cash flow growth may slow or may not continue 

  

 we may experience slowing growth or a decrease in billings revenue operating margin and free cash flow for a number of reasons including a slowdown in demand for our products or services a shift in demand from products to services increased competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market or softness in demand in certain geographies or industry verticals such as the service provider industry changes in our strategic opportunities execution risks and our failure for any reason to continue to capitalize on sales and growth opportunities due to other risks identified in the risk factors described in this periodic report our expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expected and if our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings and revenue growth we may experience margin declines and may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue do not appropriately manage our cost structure and free cash flow or encounter unanticipated liabilities any failure by us to maintain profitability maintain our margins and continue our billings revenue and free cash flow growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

 11 

we rely significantly on revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services and revenue from these services may decline or fluctuate because we recognize revenue from these services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue revenue from the sale of new or from the renewal of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in purchases of fortigate appliances or our fabric products changes in the sales mix between products and services endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors reductions in our customers’ spending levels and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to these arrangements if our sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business could suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact our billings and revenue furthermore we recognize fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically from one to three years and to a lesser extent five years as a result much of the fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts entered into during previous quarters or years consequently a decline in new or renewed fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services is not reflected in full in our statements of income until future periods our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

  

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world our international sales have represented a majority of our total revenue in recent periods therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

   

 

 

   

   

   

 

   



 12 

  

 

 

 

 

   

 

   

product and service sales and employee and contractor matters may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change over time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in litigation regulatory action costs of investigation delays in revenue recognition delays in financial reporting financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may undertake corporate operating restructurings or transfers of assets that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad in order to maximize the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure if ineffectual such restructurings or transfers could increase our income tax liabilities and in turn increase our global effective tax rate moreover our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws however the tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results 

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations while we have increased sales in recent periods to large and mediumsized businesses our sales volume varies by quarter and there is risk as to our level of success selling to these target customers such sales involve unique sales skillsets processes and structures are often more complex and feature a longer contract term and may be at higher discount levels we also have experienced uneven traction selling to certain government organizations and service providers and mssps and there can be no assurance that we will be successful selling to these customers sales to these organizations involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller entities these risks include 

  

   

 13 

 

   

 

 

   

large and mediumsized businesses service providers and mssps and government organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases longer than 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with endcustomers along with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales in addition purchases by large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays furthermore service providers and mssps represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or continued changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business large and mediumsized businesses service providers and mssps and government organizations typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability expect a broader range of services including design implementation and post golive services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors in addition large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations may require that our products and services be sold differently from how we offer our products and services which could negatively impact our operating results our large business and service provider customers may also become more deliberate in their purchases as they plan their nextgeneration network security architecture leading them to take more time in making purchasing decisions or to purchase based only on their immediate needs all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers in addition if sales expected from a large and mediumsized endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders or not place orders commensurate with our expectations if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products and accurately forecasting inventory requirements and demand can be challenging our channel partners also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture or ship certain products increases for any reason inventory shortfalls could result management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell which may impact our billings revenue margins and free cash flow mismanagement of our inventory whether due to imprecise forecasting employee errors or malfeasance inaccurate information or otherwise may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology product transitions customer requirements or excess inventory levels if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have in the past experienced inventory shortages and excesses due to the variance in demand for certain products from forecasted amounts in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage 

 14 

inventory if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder chief executive officer and chairman or michael xie our cofounder president and chief technology officer or of any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives the loss of the services or the distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering sales and marketing may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we experience turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense especially for qualified employees in network security and especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel such as the san francisco bay area and vancouver canada we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information changes in immigration laws including changes to the rules regarding h1b visas may also harm our ability to attract personnel from other countries 

if we do not increase the effectiveness of our sales organization we may have difficulty adding new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomers and our business may be adversely affected 

although we have a channel sales model sales in our industry are complex and members of our sales organization often engage in direct interaction with our prospective endcustomers particularly for larger deals involving larger endcustomers therefore we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales organization to obtain new endcustomers and sell additional products and services to our existing endcustomers there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to grow our revenue depends in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth and on the effectiveness of those personnel in selling successfully in different contexts each of which has its own different complexities approaches and competitive landscapes such as managing and growing the channel business for sales to small businesses and more actively selling to the endcustomer for sales to larger organizations new hires require substantial training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business furthermore hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity if our sales employees do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected our revenue will not increase at anticipated levels and our ability to achieve longterm projections may be negatively impacted if we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing customer base our business operating results and prospects will be adversely affected 

 15 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and operating margin and which may adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons or our product mix may change resulting in lower growth and margins based on a number of factors including competitive pricing pressures discounts or promotional programs we offer a change in our mix of products and services and anticipation of the introduction of new products and services competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or services or may bundle them with other products or services additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions have in the past and may in the future negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products or services will decrease over product life cycles we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product and service offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices gross profits and operating margin at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter we implemented a cloudbased quoting tool to help provide our sales team with the ability to have faster quote generation reduce quote errors and increase sales productivity our ability to integrate the data from this tool into our order processing may cause order processing delays which could have an effect on our financial results   if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our logistics partners’ inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter our failure to accurately forecast our inventory requirements and to appropriately manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing any delays in shipments due to trade compliance requirements labor disputes or logistics changes at shipping ports or otherwise our billings and revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products and to improve lead generation and sales enablement our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large businesses service provider and government organization market we have historically had relatively low spending on marketing activities while we have increased our investments in sales and marketing it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased revenue if our investments in additional sales personnel or our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market awareness of our company and products or increasing lead generation or if we experience turnover and disruption in our sales and marketing teams we will not be able to achieve sustained growth and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners for substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

  

a significant portion of our sales is generated through a limited number of distributors and substantially all of our revenue is from sales by our channel partners including distributors and resellers we depend on our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities and to manage our sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our products or our channel partners shift focus to other vendors andor our competitors our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

 16 

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products and incentivize them to sell our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services and may purchase more inventory than they can sell our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions in addition if our channel partners’ financial condition or operations weaken it could negatively impact their ability to sell our product and services our channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products or may decide to cease selling our products and services altogether in favor of a competitor’s products and services they may also have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot ensure that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results 

in addition we may be impacted by consolidation of our existing channel partners in such instances we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be more limited we may also become increasingly dependent on a more limited number of channel partners as consolidation increases the relative proportion of our business for which each channel partner is responsible which may magnify the risks described in the preceding paragraphs in july 2017 exclusive which distributes our solutions to a large group of resellers and endcustomers acquired fine tec us since the acquisition of fine tec us exclusive’s business with us has increased and may continue to increase in the future exclusive accounted for 38  and 35 of our total net accounts receivable as of december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 during 2016 2017 and 2018 exclusive accounted for 20  and 25  and 30  of our total revenue respectively 

in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to detect or prevent a security breach or the misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

  

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks we are also susceptible to errors defects vulnerabilities or attacks that may arise at or be inserted into our products in different stages in our supply chain or manufacturing processes and which are out of our control attacks may target specific unidentified or unresolved vulnerabilities that exist or arrive only in the supply chain making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against different customers deploy and use our products in different ways and certain deployments and usages may subject our products to adverse conditions that may negatively impact the effectiveness and useful lifetime of our products our networks and products including cloudbased technology could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation we cannot ensure that our products will prevent all security threats because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard security subscription or forticare updates or our fortigate appliances and operating systems could result in a failure of our fortiguard security subscription services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortigate appliances and cloudbased products and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of our customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect 

 17 

the market’s perception of our security products and services and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized third party any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

if we do not appropriately manage any future growth including through the expansion of our real estate facilities or are unable to improve our systems processes and controls our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

we rely heavily on information technology to help manage critical functions such as order configuration pricing and quoting revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews in addition we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on manual data entry   of customer purchase orders received through email and to a lesser extent through electronic data interchange   from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a large amount of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter an interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased billings and revenue for that quarter 

to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial operating security and administrative systems and controls and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and processes and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems controls and processes such as system capacity access security and change management controls in a timely or efficient manner our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner whether as a result of the significant growth of our business or otherwise may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses moreover the failure of our systems and processes could undermine our ability to provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results and could impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

in addition our systems processes and controls may not prevent or detect all errors omissions malfeasance or fraud such as corruption and improper “side agreements” that may impact revenue recognition or result in financial liability our productivity and the quality of our products and services may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to ensure appropriate systems processes and controls and to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our reputation and results of operations 

we have expanded our office real estate holdings to meet our projected growing need for office space we purchased office buildings in ottawa and burnaby canada in 2017 and we have started construction on a second building adjacent to our sunnyvale headquarters as we expand our campus in sunnyvale california these plans will require significant capital expenditure over the next several years and involve certain risks including impairment charges and acceleration of depreciation changes in future business strategy that may decrease the need for expansion such as a decrease in headcount and risks related to construction future changes in growth or fluctuations in cash flow may also negatively impact our ability 

 18 

to pay for these projects or free cash flow additionally inaccuracies in our projected capital expenditures could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

  

we may experience difficulties maintaining and expanding our erp and crm systems 

  

the maintenance of our erp and crm systems has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources in addition we may choose to upgrade or expand the functionality of our erp and crm systems leading to additional costs we may also discover deficiencies in our design or maintenance of the erp or crm systems that could adversely affect our ability to forecast orders process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations accurately maintain books and records provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business additionally if the system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed further we recently implemented new systems to comply with the new revenue recognition standard and may further expand the scope of our erp and crm systems our operating results may be adversely affected if these upgrades or expansions are delayed or if the systems do not function as intended or are not sufficient to meet our operating requirements 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources additionally in connection with adopting and implementing the new revenue accounting standard management will continue to make judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of the new standard the new revenue standard is principles based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances it is possible that interpretation industry practice and guidance may evolve our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition deferred contract costs and commission expense valuation of inventory accounting for business combination contingent liabilities and accounting for income taxes for example a change in our sales compensation plan may materially impact our accounting for deferred contract costs which would impact our commission expense and therefore our future operating results 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

 19 

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners including manufacturers with facilities located in taiwan china and other countries outside the united states such as microstar wistron senao adlink and ibase our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers in asia and elsewhere reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance costs supply and timing and possible tariffs any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production or shipping interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages quality problems or strike or other labor disruption at one of our manufacturing partners or locations or at shipping ports or locations would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary spu which is the key to the performance of our appliances is built by contract manufacturers including faraday megachips corporation and renesas these contract manufacturers use foundries operated by umc tsmc or renesas on a purchaseorder basis and these foundries do not guarantee their capacity and could delay orders or increase their pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary inventory shortages of our spu as well as increased costs in addition to our proprietary spu we also purchase offtheshelf asics or integrated circuits from vendors for which we have experienced and may continue to experience long lead times our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes or more profitable products if any of these manufacturers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics our business would be harmed 

  

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances directive the “eu rohs” adopted in the european union the “eu” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals” that are contained in our products have originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank” the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to efforts to determine the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements which would make it more difficult to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

 20 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage cause loss of sales and customers or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

  

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of cpus from intel network chips from broadcom marvell and intel and memory devices from intel adata ocz samsung and western digital we also may face shortages in the supply of the capacitors and resistors that are used in the manufacturing of our products the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the british pound additionally fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar may negatively impact our development plans in burnaby canada while we are not currently engaged in material hedging activities we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts through the use of forward exchange contracts if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currencydenominated operating expenses in addition a strengthening of the us dollar may increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 21 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose endcustomers in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state regional local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety product labeling environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws data privacy laws import and export controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations sanctions enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

for example with respect to data privacy and protection the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 and superseded current eu data protection regulations imposes stringent data handling requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the eu noncompliance with the gdpr could result in significant penalties including data protection audits and heavy fines compliance with and the other burdens imposed by the gdpr may limit our ability to operate or expand our business in europe and could adversely impact our operating results as could delays or shortcomings in the implementation of our gdpr compliance program 

additionally we may be subject to other legal regimes throughout the world governing data handling protection and privacy for example in june 2018 california passed the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies and will become effective in 2020 fines for noncompliance may be up to 7500 per violation the costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by the gdpr and ccpa may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business 

selling our solutions to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines other penalties and damages which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and prospects as an example the us department of justice the “doj” on its own behalf or on behalf of the general services administration the “gsa” as well as individuals has in the past pursued claims against reached financial settlements with or otherwise obtained damages from companies that sell electronic equipment and from it vendors under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing discount practices and compliance with laws related to sales to the federal government such as the trade agreements act the doj continues to actively pursue such claims violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from   future government contracting any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our revenue operating results financial condition and prospects see part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on our legal proceedings 

these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements including noncompliance in the past could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners penalties termination of contracts loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting any such damages penalties disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

global economic uncertainty and weakening product demand caused by political instability and conflict could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

economic uncertainty in various global markets caused by political instability and conflict has resulted and may continue to result in weakened demand for our products and services and difficulty for us in forecasting our financial results and managing inventory levels political developments impacting government spending and international trade including government shutdowns in the united states continued uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom’s departure from the eu and trade disputes and tariffs may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions the effects of these events may continue due to potential additional us government shutdowns instability in the united kingdom and the eu as the terms of brexit remain under negotiation and the prolonging of the united states’ trade disputes with china and other countries the continuing effect of any or all of these events could adversely impact demand for our products harm our operations and weaken our financial results 

 22 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales and could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

  

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the united states only with the required export license or through an export license exception and may be prohibited altogether from export to certain countries if we were to fail to comply with us export laws us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits eg for stocking orders placed by our partners we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

  

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements to change tax provisions related to global manufacturing and sales or to impose new tariffs economic sanctions or related legislation any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business benefits directly and indirectly from free trade agreements and we also rely on various us corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we develop market and sell our products and services globally efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements or to change corporate tax policy related to international commerce could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as could the continuing uncertainty regarding whether such actions will be taken 

moreover efforts to implement changes related to export or import regulations including the imposition of new border taxes or tariffs on foreign imports trade barriers economic sanctions and other related policies could harm our results of operations for example in march 2018 the current administration imposed a 25 tariff on steel imports and a 10 tariff on aluminum imports and announced additional tariffs on goods imported from china specifically as well as certain other countries subsequently in september 2018 additional tariffs were imposed by the united states on some goods imported from china including certain electronics and it products other countries have in turn imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods exported from the united states and both the united states and foreign countries have threatened to alter or leave current trade agreements while we do not currently expect these tariffs to have a significant effect on our raw material and product import costs if the united states expands increased tariffs or retaliatory trade measures are taken by china or other countries in response to the tariffs the cost of our products could increase our operations could be disrupted or we could be required to raise our prices which may result in the loss of customers and harm to our reputation and operating performance 

any modification in these areas any shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or any change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential endcustomers with international operations and could result in increased costs any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 23 

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products laws relating to our real property and future expansion plans and laws concerning the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

  

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury cadmium and certain plastic additives in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on exemptions for lead and other substances in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the future additionally although the eu rohs exemptions have been extended it is possible that some of these exemptions may expire in the future without being extended if this exemption is revoked or expires without extension if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

  

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to government organizations sales to government organizations are subject to a number of risks selling to government organizations can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense with long sales cycles and without any assurance of winning a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

 

 

 

 

the rules and regulations applicable to sales to government organizations may also negatively impact sales to other organizations to date we have had limited traction in sales to us federal government agencies and any future sales to government organizations is uncertain government organizations may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such government organization the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect 

 24 

our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate review and audit government vendors’ administrative and other processes and any unfavorable investigation audit or other review could result in the government’s refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the investigation audit or other review uncovers improper illegal or otherwise concerning activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

  

false detection of vulnerabilities viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

  

our fortiguard security subscription services may falsely detect report and act on viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our fortiguard security subscription services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures in addition our threat researchers periodically identify vulnerabilities in various thirdparty products and if these identifications are perceived to be incorrect or are in fact incorrect this could harm our business any such false identification or perceived false identification of important files applications or vulnerabilities could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

if our internal enterprise it networks on which we conduct internal business and interface externally or our operational networks through which we connect to customer systems and provide services are compromised public perception of our products and services will be harmed we may become subject to liability and our business operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted 

our success depends on the market’s confidence in our ability to provide effective network security protection despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal network system and website we are still vulnerable to computer viruses breakins phishing attacks attempts to overload our servers with denialofservice and other cyberattacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our internal network system or our website our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance or otherwise which breaches may be more difficult to detect than outsider threats and the existing programs and trainings we have in place to prevent such insider threats may not be effective or sufficient third parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to transfer funds or disclose information in order to gain access to our network and confidential information we cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to protect our network and website will provide absolute security moreover because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers hackers and malicious parties may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products and customers or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products or attempt to fraudulently induce our employees customers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our internal network system or data although we have not yet experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network or website an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems or website could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services and investor confidence in our company any breach of our network system or website could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to our endcustomers lead to interruptions or system slowdowns cause loss of critical data or lead to the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential proprietary or sensitive information we could also be subject to liability and litigation and reputational harm and our channel partners and endcustomers may be harmed lose confidence in us and decrease or cease using our products and services any breach of our internal network system or our website could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and stock price

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

  

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners and other third parties to resolve any issues relating to our products if we our channel partners or other third parties do not effectively assist our customers in planning deploying and operational proficiency for our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many large endcustomers and service provider or government organization endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers because of their more complex deployments and more demanding environments and business models if we our channel partners or other third parties fail to meet the requirements of our larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with large businesses service providers and government organizations as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of our subsidiaries are organized our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control these include 

   

   

   

 

   

 

   

we have open tax years that could be subject to the examination by the internal revenue service the “irs” and other tax authorities we currently have ongoing tax audits in the united kingdom israel india and italy the focus of all of these audits is the allocation of profit between our legal entities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

in december 2017 the us federal government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” the 2017 tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax in december 2017 the securities and exchange commission the “sec” staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act “sab 118” which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date as a result we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the 2017 tax act in our financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our analysis to determine the effect of the 2017 tax act within the measurement period under the sec guidance we expect further guidance may be forthcoming from the financial accounting standards board “fasb” and the sec as well as regulations interpretations and rulings from federal and state tax agencies which could result in additional impacts we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the 2017 tax act and the ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations issued in response to the 2017 tax act 

 26 

the ninth circuit court of appeals is expected to issue a decision in altera corp v commissioner regarding the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in a cost sharing arrangement which could have a material effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the quarter in which the decision is issued 

we may undertake corporate operating restructurings or transfers of assets that involve our group of foreign country subsidiaries through which we do business abroad in order to maximize the operational and tax efficiency of our group structure if ineffectual such restructurings or transfers could increase our income tax liabilities and in turn increase our global effective tax rate moreover our existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws however the tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results 

significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

  

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates in a given jurisdiction differs from our estimate our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations additionally our actual tax rate may be subject to further uncertainty due to potential changes in us and foreign tax rules 

  

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently tax authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” an international association comprised of 36 countries including the united states has issued and continues to issue guidelines and proposals that change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business due to our extensive international business activities any changes in the taxation of such activities could increase our tax obligations in many countries and may increase our worldwide effective tax rate 

 27 

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

  

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products technologies or intellectual property such as patents for example we closed our acquisitions of bradford networks inc “bradford” and zonefox limited “zonefox” in the second quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018 respectively for any past acquisition or possible future acquisition we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property and sales force into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines integrating reporting systems and procedures and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies for example we may experience difficulties integrating an acquired company’s erp or crm systems sales support and other processes and systems with our current systems and processes our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property could significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

  

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries and in some circumstances we may be required to indemnify a customer in full without a limitation on liability for certain liabilities including potential liabilities that are not contractually limited the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not cover such claim at all or may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest labor disruption and terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire power outage flood or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity and our research and development and data center in burnaby canada from which we deliver to customers our fortiguard security subscription updates is subject to the risk of flooding and is also in a region known for seismic activity any earthquake in the bay area or burnaby or flooding in burnaby could materially negatively impact our ability to provide products and services such as forticare support and fortiguard subscription services and could otherwise materially negatively impact our business in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis as well as our customers’ ability to order from us and our employees’ ability to perform their duties in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in our missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability civil unrest labor disruptions acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or of the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at the end of each quarter any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results to the extent that any of the above results in security risks to our customers delays or cancellations of customer orders the delay of the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products or interruption or downtime of our services our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

  

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes for example we enter into development agreements with third parties if our contract development projects are not successfully completed or are not completed in a timely fashion our product development could be delayed and our business generally could suffer costs for contract development can be substantial and our profitability may be harmed if we are unable to recover these costs although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

moreover business models based on softwareasaservice “saas” either hosted or cloudbased services have become increasingly indemand by our endcustomers and adopted by other providers including our competitors while we have introduced additional cloudbased products and services and will continue to do so most of our platform is currently deployed on premise and therefore if customers demand that our platform be provided through a saas business model we would be required to make additional investments in our infrastructure and personnel to be able to more fully provide our platform through a saas model in order to maintain the competitiveness of our platform such investments may involve expanding our data centers servers and networks and increasing our technical operations and engineering teams these risks are compounded by the uncertainty concerning the future viability of saas business models and the future demand for such models by customers additionally if we are unable to meet the demand to provide our services through a saas model we may lose customers to competitors 

 29 

our uniform resource locator “url” database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’  expectations 

  

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations could impair the growth of our business 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

  

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to acquire and develop internally new products and enhanced versions of our existing products in order to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

 30 

   

   

   

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

demand for our products may be limited by market perception that individual products from one vendor that provide multiple layers of security protection in one product are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of many of our products depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality into one appliance if the market for these products fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view “allinone” network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that such products of ours provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform our solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of our product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that “allinone” solutions may be suitable only for small and mediumsized businesses because such solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large businesses service provider and government organization endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with our market in general demand for multisecurity functionality products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include companies such as check point cisco f5 networks fireeye forcepoint imperva juniper mcafee palo alto networks proofpoint sonicwall sophos and trend micro 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 31 

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do our current and potential competitors may also offer point solutions fabric andor cloud security services that compete with some of the features present in our platform they may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions as a result of such acquisitions competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services as our customers refresh the security products bought in prior years they may seek to consolidate vendors which may result in current customers choosing to purchase products from our competitors on an ongoing basis due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco f5 networks and juniper offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

 32 

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from time to time legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license the gnu lesser public license the bsd license the apache license the mit x license and the mozilla public license from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as for example open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that for example could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which requirements could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

 33 

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties are currently asserting have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they have also asserted such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we may indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies nonpracticing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes as well as general commercial litigation and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion 

we have several ongoing patent lawsuits certain companies have sent us demand letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and organizations have sent letters demanding that we provide indemnification for patent claims one such patent lawsuit by british telecommunications plc was filed in federal court in delaware in july 2018 and a second such lawsuit by finjan inc was filed in federal court in california in october 2018 given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities and recent nonpracticing entity and operating entity patent litigation against other companies in the security space we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any settlement payment or adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products licensors may claim we owe them additional license fees for past and future use of their software and other intellectual property or that we cannot utilize such software or intellectual property in our products going forward there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or for reasonable pricing or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may result in significant license fees and have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

we also rely on technologies licensed from third parties in order to operate functions of our business if any of these third parties allege that we have not properly paid for such licenses or that we have improperly used the technologies under such licenses we may need to pay additional fees or obtain new licenses and such licenses may not be available on terms

acceptable to us or at all or may be costly in any such case or if we were required to redesign our internal operations to function with new technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sarbanesoxley” doddfrank and other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these requirements as well as proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations sarbanesoxley requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly although our most recent assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2018 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2019 or future periods we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

in september 2018 california enacted a law that requires publicly held companies headquartered in california to have at least one female director by the end of 2019 and at least three by the end of 2021 depending on the size of the board the law would impose financial penalties for failure to comply though we are currently in compliance with the requirements of the law for 2019 we may incur costs associated with complying with the law in future years including costs associated with expanding our board of directors or identifying qualified candidates for appointment to our board of directors or financial penalties or harm to our brand and reputation if we are unable to do so 

  

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

  

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing or new accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition equity investment valuation which became effective for us beginning on january 1 2018 and accounting for leases which became effective for us on january 1 2019 as well as the significant costs incurred or that may be incurred to adopt and to comply with these new pronouncements could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which would have an adverse effect on our business our ability to meet our reporting obligations and compliance with internal control requirements 

we have adopted the new revenue recognition standard as of january 1 2018 refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the new standard and its impact on us 

the new revenue standard is principles based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances management will continue to make judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of the new standard it is possible that interpretation industry practice and guidance may evolve as we work toward implementing the new revenue recognition standard if our circumstances change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions our operating result may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock further the new equity investment valuation standard which requires most equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income may increase the volatility of our earnings 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price could 

 35 

decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report news about us and our financial results news about our competitors and their results and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us for example during 2018 the closing price of our common stock ranged from 4383 to 9229 per share 

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

share repurchases under our repurchase program the “repurchase program” could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock could diminish our cash reserves could occur at nonoptimal prices and may not result in the most effective use of our capital 

in 2018 our board of directors approved the increase in the aggregate authorized repurchase amount under the repurchase program by 5000 million bringing the total authorization to 15 billion share repurchases under the repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock increase stock price volatility and diminish our cash reserves in addition an announcement of the reduction suspension or termination of the repurchase program could result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock moreover despite analyses we perform in connection with repurchases under the repurchase program to determine the appropriate prices for repurchases of our stock our stock price could decline resulting in repurchases made at nonoptimal prices our failure to repurchase our stock at optimal prices may be perceived by investors as an inefficient use of our cash and cash equivalents which could result in litigation that may have an adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition while our board of directors carefully considers various alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents in determining whether to authorize stock repurchases there can be no assurance that the decision by our board of directors to repurchase stock would result in in the most effective uses of our cash and cash equivalents and there may be alternative uses of our cash and cash equivalents that would be more effective such as investing in growing our business organically or through acquisitions 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

   

   

   

 

   

 36 

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

however these antitakeover provisions will not have the effect of preventing activist stockholders from seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as nominating board candidates and requesting that we pursue strategic combinations or other transactions these actions could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of activist stockholder actions could result in the loss of potential business opportunities as well as other negative business consequences actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect our business further we may incur significant expenses in retaining professionals to advise and assist us on activist stockholder matters including legal financial communications advisors and solicitation experts which may negatively impact our future financial results

our revenue growth was driven by both product and service revenue on a geographic basis revenue continues to be diversified globally which remains a key strength of our business product revenue grew 17  in 2018 fortigate unit shipments increased yearoveryear sales of nonfortigate products such as the fortinet security fabric and cloud products and services also grew significantly service revenue growth of 23  in 2018 was driven by the strength of our forticare technical support and other service revenue which combined grew 26  and fortiguard security subscription revenue which grew 20  

  

the percentage of our fortigaterelated billings from entrylevel products increased from 31  in 2017 to 33  in 2018 the percentage of our fortigaterelated billings from midrange products increased from 30  in 2017 to 32  in 2018 and the percentage of our fortigaterelated billings from highend products decreased from 39  in 2017 to 35  in 2018 we continue to see our enterprise customers purchasing a fairly balanced mix of products across these product groups 

in 2018  operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 5 percentage points compared to 2017  the decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by a decrease of 4 percentage points in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue benefiting from the adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 “topic 606” for deferred contract costs which reduced our commissions expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in addition general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1 percentage point while research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent our sales and marketing expenses included a benefit of  455 million  in 2018 from the adoption of topic 606 related to deferred contract costs under topic 606 we capitalized certain commissions on service contracts and amortize the amount over a certain period prior to the adoption of topic 606 we expensed the commissions related to these service contracts upfront excluding this benefit sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue would have been 46 in 2018 compared to 47 in 2017 refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for more information headcount increased by 15 to 5845 employees and contractors as of december 31 2018 up from 5066 as of december 31 2017 

business model 

our sales strategy is based on a twotier distribution model we sell to distributors that sell to networking security and enterprisefocused resellers and service providers who in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to large service providers and major systems integrators we also offer our products across major cloud providers and have recognized ondemand revenue from amazon web services and microsoft azure and from customers who deploy our products at a cloud services provider in a bringyourownlicense “byol” such as from amazon web services microsoft azure google cloud oracle cloud and ibm cloud in a byol arrangement a customer purchases a perpetual license from us through our channel partners and deploys the software in a cloud provider’s environment similarly customers may purchase such a license from us and deploy in their private cloud while the revenue from such sales is still relatively insignificant it has increased significantly in recent periods on a percentage basis 

typically our customers purchase our hardware products and software licenses as well as our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services we generally invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and security and technical support services the invoice is payable within 30 to 45 days we also invoice certain services on a monthly basis 

 our spu hardware architecture is an important part of our approach to network security the spu includes three lines of proprietary asics spu cp  spu np  and spu soc  the asics are designed for highly efficient execution of computationally intensive tasks including policy enforcement threat detection and encryption as such asicbased solutions can run many security applications simultaneously without a significant reduction in performance 

key metrics 

we monitor a number of key metrics including the key financial metrics set forth below in order to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational 

 44 

efficiencies the following table summarizes revenue deferred revenue billings nongaap net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow nongaap we discuss revenue below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss net cash provided by operating activities below under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue billings nongaap and free cash flow nongaap are discussed immediately below the following table 



  

deferred revenue  our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unrecognized portion of service revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual service period we monitor our deferred revenue balance growth and the mix of shortterm and longterm deferred revenue because it represents a significant portion of revenue and of free cash flow to be recognized in future periods deferred revenue was 169 billion  as of december 31 2018  an increase of 3505 million  or 26  from december 31 2017  

billings nongaap we define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period and adjustments to the deferred revenue balance due to adoption of topic 606 less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations during the period we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive current and future revenue which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business there are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of gaap revenue first billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue and are impacted by the term of security and support agreements second we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding gaap revenue and evaluating billings together with gaap revenue total billings were 215 billion  for 2018 an increase of 20  compared to 180 billion  in 2017 

a reconciliation of revenue the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to billings is provided below 



free cash flow nongaap  we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures such as purchases of real estate and other property and equipment we believe free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after capital expenditures can be used for strategic opportunities including repurchasing outstanding common stock investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet a limitation of using free cash flow rather than the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash cash equivalents and investments balance for the period because it excludes cash provided by or used in other investing and financing activities management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital 

 45 

expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the consolidated statements of cash flows and under “—liquidity and capital resources” and by presenting cash flows from investing and financing activities in our reconciliation of free cash flows in addition it is important to note that other companies including companies in our industry may not use free cash flow may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to free cash flow is provided below 



components of operating results 

revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our hardware and software products and amortization of amounts included in deferred revenue related to previous sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services we also recognize revenue from cloud business relationships and from providing professional services and training 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

  

 

 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

 

 

 46 

gross margin  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products product costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products software licenses and services and any excess inventory writeoffs service revenue and software licenses have had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher gross margins compared to product gross margins during 2018  service gross margin benefited from renewals and continued sales of hardware bundled with services and subscriptions growing faster than related expenses product gross margin was negatively impacted by new product introductions as a result the service margin expansion was partially offset by a decline in product gross margin in 2018 overall gross margin in 2019 will be impacted by service and product revenue mix but we expect it to be comparable to overall gross margin in 2018 

  operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries benefits bonuses stockbased compensation and sales commissions as applicable we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our workforce 

 

 

 

interest income  interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in corporate debt securities certificates of deposit and term deposits commercial paper money market funds and us government and agency securities 

other income expense — net  other income expense—net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign currency remeasurement as well as the gain on the sale of an investment in a privately held company 

provision for benefit from income taxes  we are subject to income taxes in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in a local country which are generally lower than us tax rates and may be subject to us income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than in the us federal research and development tax credit withholding taxes excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense and the tax impacts of the 2017 tax act 

 47 

in december 2017 the us federal government enacted the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax in december 2017 the sec staff issued sab 118 which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date as a result we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the 2017 tax act in our financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our analysis to determine the effect of the 2017 tax act within the measurement period under the sec guidance and reflected an additional 326 million increase related to transition tax in the 2018 income tax expense we expect further guidance may be forthcoming from the fasb and the sec as well as regulations interpretations and rulings from federal and state tax agencies which could result in additional impacts we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the 2017 tax act and the ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations issued in response to the 2017 tax act our selection of an accounting policy for 2018 with respect to the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” tax rules was to treat gilti tax as a current period expense under the period cost method 

our effective tax rate approximates the federal corporate income tax rate and also includes the impact of state taxes excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense federal research and development tax credit foreign withholding tax nondeductible stockbased compensation expense foreign income subject to lower tax rates than income earned in the united states booktotax basis differences and the tax impacts of the 2017 tax act 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of the significant accounting policies described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

on january 1 2018 we adopted topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under topic 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under asc topic 605 “topic 605” revenue recognition 

beginning in 2018 revenues are recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services prior to 2018 revenue was recognized under topic 605 when all of the following criteria were met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii sales price was fixed or determinable and iv collectability was reasonably assured 

under topic 606 we determine revenue recognition through the following steps 

 

 48 

our sales contracts typically contain multiple deliverables such as hardware software license security subscription technical support services and other services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations we evaluated the criteria to be distinct under topic 606 and concluded that the hardware and software licenses were distinct and distinct in the context of a contract from the security subscription and technical support services as a customer can benefit from the hardware and software licenses without the services and the services are separately identifiable within a contract we allocate a transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price we determine standalone selling price based on the historical pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately we determine standalone selling price for a product or service by considering multiple historical factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies and the term of a service contract that fall within a reasonably range as a percentage of list price 

under the previous standard topic 605 revenue from contracts that contain products and services is allocated to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price using vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if it existed or thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price existed for a deliverable we used our best estimate of selling price for that deliverable for multipleelement arrangements where software deliverables were included revenue was allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in an arrangement based on the estimated selling price hierarchy the amount allocated to the software deliverables was then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when vsoe of fair value existed if evidence of vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements did not exist all software allocated revenue was deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurred or when fair value was established when the undelivered element for which we did not have vsoe of fair value was support revenue for the entire arrangement was recognized ratably over the support period the same residual method and vsoe of fair value principles applied for our multiple element arrangements that contained only software elements 

deferred contract costs and commission expense 

beginning in 2018 we recognized commission expense based on topic 606s guidance for contract costs under this new guidance we recognize sales commissions related to product sales upfront while sales commissions for service contracts are deferred as deferred contract costs in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the applicable amortization period costs for initial contracts that are not commensurate with renewal commissions are amortized on a straightline basis over the period of benefit which we have determined to be five years and which is typically longer than the initial contract term significant estimates assumptions and judgments in accounting for deferred contract costs include but are not limited to identification of contract costs anticipated billings and the expected period of benefit 

valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using the firstin firstout method in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record additional inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

business combinations 

we include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill we often continue to gather additional information throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded such changes are recorded in the period in which they are identified 

contingent liabilities 

from time to time we are involved in disputes litigation and other legal actions however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other thirdparty claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations we   review significant new claims and litigation for the probability of an adverse outcome estimates can change as individual claims develop the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in addition deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of the position that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

effective january 1 2018 the 2017 tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax we expect further guidance may be forthcoming from the fasb and the sec as well as regulations interpretations and rulings from federal and state tax agencies which could result in additional impacts our selection of an accounting policy for 2018 with respect to the gilti tax rules was to treat gilti tax as a current period expense under the period cost method 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of income become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets would be recorded in the consolidated statements of income for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required

 54 

research and development 

research and development expense increased by 339 million  or 16  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to an increase of 287 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products in addition depreciation and other occupancyrelated costs increased by 28 million and product development costs such as thirdparty testing and prototypes increased by 12 million we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization and expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2019 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 813 million  or 12  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to an increase of 649 million in personnel costs including higher stockbased compensation expense of 176 million sales and marketing headcount increased in order to drive market share gains globally the increase in personnel costs included a benefit of  455 million  from the adoption of topic 606 related to deferred contract costs under topic 606 we capitalized certain commissions on service contracts and amortize the amount over a certain period prior to the adoption of this new standard we expensed the commissions related to these service contracts our sales and marketing expense would have increased by 1268 million or 18 under topic 605 refer to note 1 in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information in addition depreciation expense and other occupancyrelated expense increased by 67 million travel and entertainment expense increased by 64 million and supplies expense increased by 20 million as a percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expense decreased primarily due to the benefit from the new accounting standard on deferred contract costs excluding this benefit sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue would have been 46 of total revenue we intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure and marketing strategy which are critical to support growth and expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2019 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 51 million  or 6  in 2018  compared to 2017  personnel costs increased by 98 million as we continued to increase headcount in order to support our expanding business the increase in expense was partially offset by a decrease in litigation costs of 12 million and a decrease in professional fees of 06 million certain facilities depreciation and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2019 

operating income and margin 

we generated operating income of 2310 million in 2018 an increase of 1212 million or 110 compared to 1098 million in 2017 the improvement in operating income included the benefit from the adoption of topic 606 along with revenue growth outpacing expense growth operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 13 in 2018 compared to 7 in 2017 the increase in operating margin is primarily due to a decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue to 43 in 2018 compared to 47 in 2017 excluding the benefit from the adoption of topic 606 sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue would have been 46 of total revenue the adoption of topic 606 resulted in an improvement of 3 percentage points in our operating margin in addition general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 1 percentage point and gross margin improved by 08  percentage points contributing to the improvement in operating margin research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue remained consistent 

interest income and other income expense — net 

  



interest income increased in 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates on invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments interest income varies depending on our average investment balances during the period types and mix of investments and market interest rates the change in other income expense—net in 2018 as 

 55 

compared to 2017 was the result of 93 million of foreign currency transaction and hedging losses recognized in 2018 offset by 22 million in gain on the sale of an investment in a privately held company 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

  



1 provision for income taxes during 2018 under topic 606 as reported and 605 balances without adoption of topic 606 were as follows 



our provision for income taxes for 2018 reflects an effective tax rate benefit of 32  compared to an effective tax rate provision of 75  for 2017  the benefit from income taxes for 2018  was comprised primarily of impacts related to the 2017 tax act including a benefit of 1640 million from the realignment of our tax structure and operations that resulted in a booktotax basis difference from previously taxed offshore deferred revenue these benefits were partially offset by a 326 million increase in the transition tax for finalization of the provisional estimates under sab 118 a 205 million tax expense for the impact of the gilti and a 296 million of tax expense related to us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes and a decrease in tax reserves 

effective january 1 2018 the 2017 tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax under gaap changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate in december 2017 the sec staff issued sab 118 which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date as a result we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the 2017 tax act in our financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our analysis to determine the effect of the 2017 tax act within the measurement period under the sec guidance and reflected an increase of an additional 326 million related to the transition tax in the 2018 income tax expense we expect further guidance may be forthcoming from the fasb and the sec as well as regulations interpretations and rulings from federal and state tax agencies which could result in additional impacts 

in 2017 the effective tax rate was 75 primarily resulting from the deferred tax assets remeasurement and a onetime transition tax due to the 2017 tax act excluding the tax impacts from the 2017 tax act our 2017 effective tax rate would have been 24

2017  and 2016   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased by 2195 million or 17 in 2017 compared to 2016 we continued to experience global diversification of revenue in 2017 revenue from all our regions grew with the americas contributing the largest portion of our revenue growth both on an absolute dollar and on a percentage basis product revenue increased by 291 million or 5 in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family across all product categories sales of nonfortigate products such as the fortinet security fabric hardware and software products and services also grew significantly service revenue increased by 1904 million or 26 in 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in service revenue was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods 

  

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



  

total gross margin increased by 07 percentage points in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by higher margin on service revenue during 2017 service gross margin benefited from the shift to highermargin service revenue product gross margin was negatively impacted by longer term deals resulting in lower product revenue recognized in 2017 and higher deferred revenue for services that was expected to be recognized in future periods and as a result of product costs being recognized upon shipment as a result the service margin expansion was partially offset by a decline in product gross margin in 2017 total cost of product revenue was comprised primarily of direct and indirect cost of products sold inventory reserves and other charges cost of service revenue was comprised primarily of personnel costs 

  

 57 

operating expenses 

  



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 275 million or 15 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase of 176 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products in addition product development costs such as thirdparty testing and prototypes increased by 62 million and depreciation and other occupancyrelated costs increased by 31 million 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 745 million or 12 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase of 551 million in personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales and marketing headcount in order to drive continued market share gains globally marketingrelated expense increased by 119 million as we invested significantly in marketing programs to drive broader market awareness build lead generation programs and accelerate pipeline in addition depreciation expense and other occupancyrelated expense increased by 68 million as a percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expense decreased as revenue grew at a higher pace compared to personnel costs 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 68 million or 8 in 2017 compared to 2016 personnel costs increased by 85 million as we continued to increase headcount in order to support our expanding business professional fees increased by 106 million primarily due to the implementation of a new revenue recognition system and a litigation settlement expense of 18 million the increase in expense was partially offset by a decrease in thirdparty costs of 134 million related to the substantial completion of our erp system implementation in 2016 

operating income and margin 

we generated operating income of 1098 million in 2017 an increase of 669 million or 156 compared to 429 million in 2016 the improvement in operating margin was primarily due to the improvement in gross margin and the decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue as a percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased to 47 in 2017 from 49 in 2016 

interest income and other income expense — net 

  



interest income increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to higher interest rates on invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments interest income varies depending on our average investment balances during the 

 58 

period types and mix of investments and market interest rates the change in other income expense—net in 2017 as compared to 2016 was the result of a gain of approximately 10 million for foreign currency exchange gains in 2017 compared to a loss of 66 million in 2016 due primarily to changes in the value of euro relative to the us dollar 

provision for income taxes 

  



our effective tax rate was 75 for 2017 compared to an effective tax rate of 25 for 2016 the provision for income taxes for 2017 was comprised primarily of us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes an increase in tax reserves remeasurement of deferred tax assets and a onetime transition tax 

in december 2017 the us federal government enacted the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax under gaap changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate 

the sec staff has issued sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the 2017 tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the 2017 tax act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the 2017 tax act 

the increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily due to the deferred tax assets remeasurement and a onetime transition tax due to the 2017 tax act excluding the tax impact from the 2017 tax act the 2017 effective tax rate would have been 24 which was relatively consistent with 2016 in 2016 due to the early adoption of asu 201609 approximately 108 million of excess tax benefits were recognized in the income tax provision in 2017 135 million of excess tax benefits was included in the income tax provision 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of income data for the last eight quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period 

 59 



 

1 includes stockbased compensation as follows 



 60 

2 total amortization included in product costs service costs and sales and marketing expense are as follows 



seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend which has positively impacted billings and product revenue activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential customer buying followed by an increase in buying in the second quarter the third quarter is often consistent with the second quarter although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

consistent with the seasonality note above our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has generally increased sequentially in each quarter except in the first and third quarters of 2018 and 2017 product revenue in each quarter in 2018  increased as compared to the same quarter in 2017  which we believe was due to investments we made in our sales and marketing organizations continued product innovation and a robust security market we continue to see a shift from product revenue to highermargin recurring service revenue which is a result of our growing customer base 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to seasonality of product sales and seasonality of cost increases product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products in 2018 product gross margin was impacted by new product introductions and the mix of highend midrange and entrylevel products service gross margin benefited from the growth   of our customer base and renewals 

 61 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as by our stock repurchases real estate and other capital expenditures proceeds associated with stock option exercises and issuances of common stock under our equity incentive plans payment of taxes in connection with the net settlement of equity awards and business acquisitions in recent years we have received significant capital resources as a result of increases in our deferred revenue and the proceeds from exercise of stock options and purchases under our equity incentive plans additional increases in deferred revenue may depend on a number of factors including our billing growth rate service contract renewal rates and length of initial and renewals service contracts we expect proceeds from the issuance of stock options in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units versus stock options granted and also to vary based on our share price as of december 31 2018 7338 million  remained available for future share repurchase under the repurchase program 

construction to our new headquarters building started in the fourth quarter of 2018 and related spending will continue in 2019 and until project completion we estimate 2019 spending on the project to be between 600 million to 800 million dollars 

as of december 31 2018  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 172 billion  were invested primarily in corporate debt securities certificates of deposit and term deposits commercial paper money market funds and us government and agency securities it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital provides liquidity and maximizes return without significantly increasing risk we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 

the amount of cash cash equivalents and investments held by our international subsidiaries was 9566 million  as of december 31 2018  under the 2017 tax act signed into law in december 2017 starting on january 1 2018 we are no longer subject to federal income tax on earnings remitted from our foreign subsidiaries we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to repatriation and have determined that we will be repatriating certain unremitted foreign earnings which were previously deemed indefinitely reinvested for those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation we have recorded a provisional estimate for withholding and state taxes most of our offshore cash is located in singapore 

 we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and amount of our planned share repurchases the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the continuing market acceptance of our products and our investments in real estate through purchases or longterm leases historically we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisition activities in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 62 

operating activities 

cash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity it is primarily comprised of net income as adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities including deferred revenue noncash adjustments consist primarily of stockbased compensation amortization of deferred contract costs in connection with the adoption of topic 606 depreciation of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets and amortization of investment premiums 

  

 our operating activities during 2018 provided 6389 million  in cash as a result of the continued growth of our business and our ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue our total deferred revenue balance grew 26 as of december 31 2018 compared to the same period last year to 169 billion 

our operating activities during 2017 provided 5944 million in cash as a result of our continued growth of our business and our ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable we continued to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues and longer duration contracts our total revenue grew 17 in 2017 compared to 2016 and our total deferred revenue balance grew 29 

our operating activities during 2016 provided 3457 million in cash as a result of our continued growth of our business and the ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical supports to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and payments for inventory purchases we also started to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues our total revenue grew 26 in 2016 compared to 2015 while our total deferred revenue balance grew 31 

investing activities 

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments purchases of property and equipment and payments made in connection with business acquisitions historically in making a lease versus purchase decision related to our larger facilities we have considered various factors including financial metrics and the impact on our employees in certain cases we have elected to purchase the facility if we believed that purchasing rather than leasing is more in line with our longterm strategy we expect to make similar decisions in the future 

during 2018 cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 602 million  spent for purchases of our investments net of maturities and sales of investments 530 million  spent on capital expenditures and 217 million  used for the acquisitions of bradford and zonefox net of cash acquired 

during 2017 cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 1353 million we spent on capital expenditures including our purchases of real estate properties in canada and sunnyvale california for total cash of 1072 million the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities and sales net of purchases from our investments of 585 million 

during 2016 cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 672 million we spent on capital expenditures including our purchases of a warehouse in union city california for total cash of 185 million and a 221 million payment for the acquisition of accelops the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities and sales net of purchases from our investments of 151 million 

financing activities 

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to repurchase and retirement of common stock proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and payments of debt assumed in business combinations 

during 2018 cash used in financing activities was 2026 million  primarily due to 2118 million  used to repurchase our common stock and 101 million  of payments of the debt assumed in business combinations this was partially offset by 193 million  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of tax withholding 

 63 

during 2017 cash used in financing activities was 4156 million primarily due to 4463 million used to repurchase our common stock this was partially offset by 307 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of tax withholding 

during 2016 cash used in financing activities was 1059 million primarily due to 1108 million used to repurchase our common stock this was partially offset by 65 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of tax withholding 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  

  



 

 

in addition to commitments with contract manufacturers we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services as of december 31 2018  we had 143 million  in other contractual commitments having a remaining term in excess of one year that may not be cancelable 

as of december 31 2018  we had 775 million  of longterm income tax liabilities including interest related to uncertain tax positions because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during 2018  2017  and 2016  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities including corporate debt securities certificates of deposit and term deposits commercial paper money market funds and us government and agency securities the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2018  2017  and 2016  would have resulted in an insignificant decrease in our interest income in each of these periods 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the united states are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar “cad” the euro “eur” and the british pound “gbp” to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to minimize the impact of balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the credit worthiness of these parties these contracts typically have a maturity of one month and settle on the last day of each month we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts in other income expense—net in the consolidated statements of income we recognized an expense of 93 million in 2018  due to foreign currency transaction and hedging losses 

our use of forward exchange contracts is intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements our forward exchange contracts are relatively shortterm in nature and are focused on the cad longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar against other foreign currencies such as the eur and gbp could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 62 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash balances as of december 31 2018 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are predominantly shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

intellectual property 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology as of december 31 2017  we had 467 issued us and foreignissued patents and 291 pending us and foreign patent applications we also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms 

despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights third parties have asserted are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected we typically indemnify our endcustomers distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties 

seasonality 

for information regarding seasonality in our sales see the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—quarterly results of operations—seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

• our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and technological expertise 

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

• brand recognition 

• customer service and support 

• sales and distribution capabilities 

• size and financial stability of operations and 

• breadth of product line 

among others our competitors include check point software technologies ltd “check point” cisco systems inc “cisco” f5 networks inc “f5 networks” fireeye inc “fireeye” forcepoint llc “forcepoint” imperva inc “imperva” juniper networks inc “juniper” mcafee llc “mcafee” palo alto networks inc “palo alto networks” proofpoint inc “proofpoint” sonicwall inc “sonicwall” sophos group plc “sophos” symantec corporation “symantec” and trend micro incorporated “trend micro” 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance reliability and breadth our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality 

 7 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance market their products better or achieve greater market acceptance than us in addition our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  our total headcount was 5066  employees and contractors none of our us employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in certain european countries have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain uptodate union membership we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors may lose some or all of their investment 

risks related to our business   

our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control or may be difficult to predict including

 10 

 

 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature over the near term accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global economic conditions and spending environments weak economic conditions in certain regions or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could have adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our channel partners reduced unit sales and slower or declining growth 

our billings revenue operating margin and free cash flow growth may slow or may not continue 

  

 we may experience slowing growth or a decrease in billings revenue operating margin and free cash flow for a number of reasons including a slowdown in demand for our products or services a shift in demand from products to services increased competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market or softness in demand in certain geographies or industry verticals such as the service provider industry changes in our strategic opportunities and our failure for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities and due to other risks identified in the risk factors described in this periodic report our expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expected and if our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings and revenue growth we may experience margin declines and may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue do not appropriately manage our cost structure and free cash flow or encounter unanticipated liabilities any failure by us to maintain profitability maintain our margins and continue our billings revenue and free cash flow growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline

we rely significantly on revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services and revenue from these services may decline or fluctuate because we recognize revenue from these services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue revenue from the sale of new or from the renewal of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in purchases of fortigate appliances changes in the sales mix between products and services endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors reductions in our customers’ spending levels and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to these arrangements if our sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business could suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact our billings and revenue furthermore we recognize fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically from one to three years to a lesser extent five years as a result much of the fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts entered into during previous quarters or years consequently a decline in new or renewed fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services is not reflected in full in our statements of operations until future periods our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

  

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world our international sales have represented a majority of our total revenue in recent periods therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including

product and service sales and employee and contractor matters may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change over time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in litigation regulatory action costs of investigation delays in revenue recognition delays in financial reporting financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations while we have increased sales in recent periods to large and mediumsized businesses our sales volume varies by quarter such sales are often for a longer contract term and may be at higher discount levels we also have experienced uneven traction selling to certain government organizations and service providers and there can be no assurance that we will be successful selling to these customers sales to these organizations involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller entities these risks include 

  

   

 

   

 



 13 

   

large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases longer than 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with endcustomers along with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales in addition product purchases by large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays furthermore service providers represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or continued changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability expect a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors in addition large and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations may require that our products and services be sold differently from how we offer our products and services which could negatively impact our operating results our large business and service provider customers may also become more deliberate in their purchases as they plan their nextgeneration network security architecture leading them to take more time in making purchasing decisions or to purchase based only on their immediate needs all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers in addition if sales expected from a large and mediumsized endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders or not place orders commensurate with our expectations if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products and accurately forecasting inventory requirements and demand can be challenging our channel partners also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture or ship certain products increases for any reason inventory shortfalls could result management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell which may impact our billings revenue and free cash flow mismanagement of our inventory whether due to imprecise forecasting employee errors or malfeasance inaccurate information or otherwise may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements or excess inventory levels if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have in the past experienced inventory shortages and excesses due to the variance in demand for certain products from forecasted amounts in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

 14 

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder chief executive officer and chairman or michael xie our cofounder president and chief technology officer or of any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives in february 2018 we underwent a transition in senior management as drew del matto resigned as our chief financial officer and keith jensen was appointed as our interim chief financial officer the loss of the services or the distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering sales and marketing may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we experience turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense especially for qualified employees in network security and especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel such as the san francisco bay area and vancouver canada we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information changes in immigration laws including changes to the rules regarding h1b visas may also harm our ability to attract personnel from other countries 

if we do not increase the effectiveness of our sales organization we may have difficulty adding new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomers and our business may be adversely affected 

although we have a channel sales model members of our sales organization often engage in direct interaction with our prospective endcustomers therefore we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales organization to obtain new endcustomers and sell additional products and services to our existing endcustomers there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to grow our revenue depends in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth and on the effectiveness of those personnel new hires require substantial training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business for example we realigned our sales organization in early 2016 and it has taken more time than we expected to ramp up the productivity of our realigned sales organization furthermore hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity if our sales employees do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected our revenue will not increase at anticipated levels and our ability to achieve longterm projections may be negatively impacted if we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing customer base our business operating results and prospects will be adversely affected 

 15 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and operating margin and which may adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts or promotional programs we offer a change in our mix of products and services and anticipation of the introduction of new products and services competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or services or may bundle them with other products or services additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions have in the past and may in the future negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products or services will decrease over product life cycles we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product and service offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices gross profits and operating margin at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our logistics partners’ inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter our failure to accurately forecast our inventory requirements and to appropriately manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing any delays in shipments due to trade compliance requirements labor disputes or logistics changes at shipping ports or otherwise our billings and revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products and to improve lead generation and sales enablement our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large businesses service provider and government organization market we have historically had relatively low spending on marketing activities while we have increased our investments in sales and marketing it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased revenue if our investments in additional sales personnel or if our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market awareness of our company and products or increasing lead generation or if we experience turnover and disruption in our sales and marketing teams we will not be able to achieve sustained growth and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

  

a significant portion of our sales is generated through a limited number of distributors and substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners including distributors and resellers we depend on our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities and to manage our sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products or if we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

 16 

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products and incentivize them to sell our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services and may purchase more inventory than they can sell our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions in addition if our channel partners’ financial condition or operations weaken it could negatively impact their ability to sell our product and services our channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products they may also have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot ensure that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results 

in addition we may be impacted by consolidation of our existing channel partners in such instances we may experience changes to our overall business and operational relationships due to dealing with a larger combined entity and our ability to maintain such relationships on favorable contractual terms may be more limited we may also become increasingly dependent on a more limited number of channel partners as consolidation increases the relative proportion of our business for which each channel partner is responsible which may magnify the risks described in the preceding paragraphs in july 2017 exclusive which distributes our solutions to a large group of resellers and endcustomers acquired fine tec us since the acquisition of fine tec us exclusive’s business with us has increased and may continue to increase in the future the two channel partners together accounted for 35 of our total net accounts receivable as of december 31 2017 and 25  of our total revenue during 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the combined exclusivefine tec us entity accounted for 30 of our total revenue during 2015 and 2016 exclusive accounted for 18  and 20  of our total revenue respectively 

in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach or the misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

  

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks different customers deploy and use our products in different ways and certain deployments and usages may subject our products to adverse conditions that may negatively impact the effectiveness and useful lifetime of our products our networks and products including cloudbased technology and subscriptions could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation we cannot ensure that our products will prevent all security threats because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard security subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard security subscription services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortigate appliances and cloudbased products and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of our customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products and services and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative 

 17 

press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized third party any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our business and operations have experienced growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth including through the expansion of our real estate holdings or are unable to improve our systems and processes our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

our business has grown over the last several years we rely heavily on information technology and accounting systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews certain of these systems were developed by us for our internal use and as such may have a higher risk of failure or not receive the same level of support as systems purchased from and supported by external technology companies in addition we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on manual data entry   of customer purchase orders received through email and to a lesser extent through electronic data interchange   from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a large amount of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter an interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased billings and revenue for that quarter 

to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial operating and administrative systems and controls and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems controls and processes such as system capacity access and change management controls in a timely or efficient manner our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner whether as a result of the significant growth of our business or otherwise may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses moreover the failure of our systems and processes could undermine our ability to provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results and could impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our productivity and the quality of our products and services may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations 

we have expanded our office real estate holdings to meet our projected growing need for office space we purchased office buildings in ottawa and burnaby canada in 2017 and we have purchased various small buildings adjacent to our sunnyvale headquarters as we expand our headquarters in sunnyvale california these plans will require significant capital expenditure over the next several years and involve certain risks including impairment charges and acceleration of depreciation changes in future business strategy that may decrease the need for expansion such as a decrease in headcount and risks related to construction future changes in growth or fluctuations in cash flow may also negatively impact our ability to pay for these projects or free cash flow additionally inaccuracies in our projected capital expenditures could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

  

 18 

we may experience difficulties maintaining and expanding our erp and crm systems 

  

the maintenance of our erp and crm systems has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources in addition we may choose to upgrade or expand the functionality of our erp and crm systems leading to additional costs we may also discover deficiencies in our design or maintenance of the erp or crm systems that could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations accurately maintain books and records provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business additionally if the system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed further we recently implemented new systems to comply with the new revenue recognition standard and may further expand the scope of our erp and crm systems our operating results may be adversely affected if these upgrades or expansions are delayed or if the systems do not function as intended or are not sufficient to meet our revenue recognition accounting requirements 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources additionally in connection with adopting and implementing the new revenue accounting standard management will make judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of the new standard the new revenue standard is principles based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances it is possible that interpretation industry practice and guidance may evolve as we work toward implementing the new standard our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition and sales return reserves stockbased compensation expense valuation of inventory investments accounting for business combination goodwill and other longlived assets restructuring accounting for income taxes and litigation and settlement costs 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

 19 

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners including microstar international co ltd wistron corporation flex ltd senao networks inc adlink technology inc and a number of manufacturers located in taiwan and other countries outside the united states our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers in asia and elsewhere reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance and product costs supply and timing any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production or shipping interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages quality problems or strike or other labor disruption at one of our manufacturing partners or locations or at shipping ports or locations would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary spu which is the key to the performance of our appliances is built by contract manufacturers including faraday megachips corporation and renesas these contract manufacturers use foundries operated by umc tsmc or renesas on a purchaseorder basis and these foundries do not guarantee their capacity and could reject orders or increase their pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary or longterm inventory shortages of our spu as well as increased costs in addition to our proprietary spu we also purchase offtheshelf asics from vendors for which we have experienced and may continue to experience long lead times our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes or more profitable products if any of these manufacturers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics our business would be harmed 

  

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances directive the “eu rohs” adopted in the european union the “eu” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals” that are contained in our products have originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank” the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year although the sec has provided guidance with respect to a portion of the conflict minerals filing requirements that somewhat reduced the reporting required we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to efforts to determine the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

 20 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage cause loss of sales and customers or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins and free cash flow 

  

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of cpus from intel network chips from broadcom marvell and intel and memory devices from intel adata ocz samsung and western digital we also may face shortages in the supply of the capacitors and resistors that are used in the manufacturing of our products the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the british pound additionally fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar may negatively impact our development plans in burnaby canada while we are not currently engaged in material hedging activities we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts through the use of forward exchange contracts if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currencydenominated operating expenses in addition a strengthening of the us dollar may increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 21 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose endcustomers in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety product labeling environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws data privacy laws import and export controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the united states noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations sanctions enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

for example with respect to data privacy in april 2016 the european parliament approved the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which will come into effect in may 2018 and supersede current eu data protection regulations the gdpr will impose stringent data handling requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the eu and noncompliance with the gdpr could result in significant penalties including data protection audits and heavy fines compliance with and the other burdens imposed by the gdpr may limit our ability to operate or expand our business in europe and could adversely impact our operating results any noncompliance with the gdpr whether perceived or actual could also adversely impact our operating results 

selling our solutions to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines other penalties and damages which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and prospects as an example the us department of justice the “doj” on its own behalf or on behalf of the general services administration the “gsa” as well as individuals has in the past pursued claims against reached financial settlements with or otherwise obtained damages from companies that sell electronic equipment and from it vendors under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing discount practices and compliance with laws related to sales to the federal government such as the trade agreements act the doj continues to actively pursue such claims violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from   future government contracting any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our revenue operating results financial condition and prospects see part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on our legal proceedings 

these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements including noncompliance in the past could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners penalties termination of contracts loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting any such damages penalties disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales and could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

  

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the united states only with the required export license or through an export license exception and may be prohibited altogether from export to certain countries if we were to fail to comply with us export laws us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits eg for stocking orders placed by our partners we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

  

 22 

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

efforts to withdraw from or materially modify nafta or other international trade agreements to change tax provisions related to global manufacturing and sales or to impose new tariffs economic sanctions or related legislation any of which could our adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement “nafta” and we also rely on various us corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we develop market and sell our products and services globally efforts to withdraw from or materially modify nafta or other international trade agreements or to change corporate tax policy related to international commerce could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as could the continuing uncertainty regarding whether such actions will be taken moreover efforts to implement changes related to export or import regulations including the imposition of new border taxes or tariffs on foreign imports economic sanctions or related policies any modification in these areas any shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or any change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential endcustomers with international operations and could result in increased costs any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products laws relating to our real property and future expansion plans and laws concerning the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive the “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

  

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury cadmium and certain plastic additives in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on exemptions for lead and other substances in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the future additionally although we have filed for an extension it is possible that this exemption may expire in the future without being extended if this exemption is revoked or expires without extension if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

 23 

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

  

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to government organizations sales to government organizations are subject to a number of risks selling to government organizations can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense with long sales cycles and without any assurance of winning a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

 

 

 

 

the rules and regulations applicable to sales to government organizations may also negatively impact sales to other organizations to date we have had limited traction in sales to us federal government agencies and any future sales to government organizations is uncertain government organizations may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such government organization the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate review and audit government vendors’ administrative and other processes and any unfavorable investigation audit or other review could result in the government’s refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the investigation audit or other review uncovers improper illegal or otherwise concerning activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

  

 24 

false detection of vulnerabilities viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

  

our fortiguard security subscription services may falsely detect report and act on viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our fortiguard security subscription services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures in addition our threat researchers periodically identify vulnerabilities in various thirdparty products and if these identifications are perceived to be incorrect or are in fact incorrect this could harm our business any such false identification or perceived false identification of important files applications or vulnerabilities could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

if our internal network system or our website is compromised public perception of our products and services will be harmed we may become subject to liability and our business operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted 

our success depends on the market’s confidence in our ability to provide effective network security protection despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal network system and website we are still vulnerable to computer viruses breakins phishing attacks attempts to overload our servers with denialofservice and other cyberattacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our internal network system or our website our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance or otherwise and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to transfer funds or disclose information in order to gain access to our network and confidential information we cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to protect our network and website will provide absolute security moreover because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers although we have not yet experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network or website an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems or website could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services and investor confidence in our company any breach of our network system or website could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to our endcustomers lead to interruptions or system slowdowns cause loss of critical data or lead to the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential proprietary or sensitive information we could also be subject to liability and litigation and reputational harm and our channel partners and endcustomers may be harmed lose confidence in us and decrease or cease using our products and services any breach of our internal network system or our website could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and stock price 

  

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

  

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners and other third parties to resolve any issues relating to our products if we our channel partners or other third parties do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many large endcustomers and service provider or government organization endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers because of their more complex deployments and more demanding environments and business models if we our channel partners or other third parties fail to meet the requirements of our larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with large businesses service providers and government organizations as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 25 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of our subsidiaries are organized our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

  

 

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

 

   

   

significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the financial accounting standards board standard in addition the standard applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain foreign countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

in addition we have open tax years that could be subject to the examination by the internal revenue service the “irs” and other tax authorities tax authorities in france are currently examining the intercompany relationship between fortinet inc fortinet france and fortinet singapore in april 2017 we received a notice from the french tax authorities that an audit was officially opened for tax years from 2007 to 2015 we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

 26 

in december 2017 the us federal government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” the 2017 tax act significantly changed the existing us corporate income tax laws by among other things lowering the corporate tax rate implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime deemed repatriation tax on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not previously recognized us income taxes given the timing scope and magnitude of the changes enacted by the 2017 tax act along with ongoing implementation efforts guidance and other developments from us regulatory and standardsetting bodies the completion of the accounting for certain tax items included in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements that have been reported as provisional or where no estimate of the impact was provided as a result of us not having the necessary information may be subject to material change any significant changes to our future effective tax rate including final resolution of provisional amounts relating to effects of the 2017 tax act may result in a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows for example in the fourth quarter of 2017 we provisionally recorded a 479 million expense on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate and a 152 million expense for the onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation related to the 2017 tax act we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of the 2017 tax act and the ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations issued in response to the 2017 tax act 

although we currently do not have a valuation allowance we may in the future be required to establish one we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

  

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates in a given jurisdiction differs from our estimate our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations additionally our actual tax rate may be subject to further uncertainty due to potential changes in us and foreign tax rules 

  

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” has been working on a base erosion and profit sharing project commonly known as beps as part of this project the oecd has issued and continues to issue guidelines and proposals that change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business due to our extensive international business activities any changes in the taxation of such activities could increase our tax obligations in many countries and may increase our worldwide effective tax rate 

 27 

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

  

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products technologies or intellectual property such as patents for any possible future acquisition we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property and sales force into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines integrating reporting systems and procedures and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies for example we may experience difficulties integrating an acquired company’s erp or crm systems sales support and other processes and systems with our current systems and processes our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property could significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

  

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries and in some circumstances we may be required to indemnify a customer in full without a limitation on liability for certain liabilities including potential liabilities that are not contractually limited the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not cover such claim at all or may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

  

 28 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest labor disruption and terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire power outage flood or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity and our research and development and data center in burnaby canada from which we deliver customers our fortiguard security subscription updates is subject to the risk of flooding and is also in a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis as well as our customers’ ability to order from us and our employees’ ability to perform their duties in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in our missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability civil unrest labor disruptions acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or of the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at the end of each quarter any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results to the extent that any of the above results in security risks to our customers delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay of the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

  

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes for example we enter into development agreements with third parties if our contract development projects are not successfully completed or are not completed in a timely fashion our product development could be delayed and our business generally could suffer costs for contract development can be substantial and our profitability may be harmed if we are unable to recover these costs although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

moreover business models based on softwareasaservice “saas” and infrastructureasaservice “iaas” both of which are hosted or cloudbased services have become increasingly indemand by our endcustomers and adopted by other providers including our competitors while we have introduced additional cloudbased products and services and will continue to do so most of our platform is currently deployed on premise and therefore if customers demand that our platform be provided through a saas or iaas business model we would be required to make additional investments in our infrastructure and personnel to be able to more fully provide our platform through a saas or iaas model in order to maintain the competitiveness of our platform such investments may involve expanding our data centers servers and networks and increasing our technical operations and engineering teams these risks are compounded by the uncertainty concerning the future viability of saas and iaas business models and the future demand for such models by customers additionally if we are unable to meet the demand to provide our services through a saas or iaas model we may lose customers to competitors 

 29 

our uniform resource locator “url” database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’  expectations 

  

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations could impair the growth of our business 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

  

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products in order to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   



 30 

  

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

demand for our products may be limited by market perception that individual products from one vendor that provide multiple layers of security protection in one product are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of many of our products depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality into one appliance if the market for these products fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view “allinone” network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that such products of ours provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform our solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of our product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that “allinone” solutions may be suitable only for small and mediumsized businesses because such solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large businesses service provider and government organization endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with our market in general demand for multisecurity functionality products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include companies such as check point cisco f5 networks fireeye forcepoint imperva juniper mcafee palo alto networks proofpoint sonicwall sophos symantec and trend micro 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 31 

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do our current and potential competitors may also offer point solutions fabric andor cloud security services that compete with some of the features present in our platform they may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions as a result of such acquisitions competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco f5 networks and juniper offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from time to time legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license the gnu lesser public license the bsd license the apache license the mit x license and the mozilla public license from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which requirements could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

 33 

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties are currently asserting have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they have also asserted such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we may indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies nonpracticing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes as well as general commercial litigation and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion 

we have several ongoing patent lawsuits several nonpracticing entity patent holding companies have sent us letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and organizations have sent letters demanding that we provide indemnification for patent claims given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities and recent nonpracticing entity and operating entity patent litigation against other companies in the security space we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

we also rely on technologies licensed from third parties in order to operate functions of our business if any of these third parties allege that we have not properly paid for such licenses or that we have improperly used the technologies under such licenses we may need to pay additional fees or obtain new licenses and such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in either case or if we were required to redesign our internal operations to function with new technologies our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

 34 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sarbanesoxley” doddfrank and other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these requirements as well as proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations sarbanesoxley requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly although our most recent assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2017 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2018 or future periods we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

  

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

  

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing or new accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition equity investment valuation which became effective for us beginning on january 1 2018 and accounting for leases which will become effective for us on january 1 2019 as well as the significant costs incurred that may be incurred to adopt and to comply with these new pronouncements could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which would have an adverse effect on our business our ability to meet our reporting obligations and compliance with internal control requirements 

as a result of adopting and implementing the new revenue recognition standard we will be required to change our accounting for commission expense we will capitalize and amortize certain direct costs such as commissions over the expected period of benefit rather than expensing them as incurred while the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard does not change the cash flows received from our contracts with customers its adoption could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations refer to note 1 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the new standard and its potential impact on us the new revenue standard is principles based and interpretation of those principles may vary from company to company based on their unique circumstances management will make judgments and assumptions based on our interpretation of the new standard it is possible that interpretation industry practice and guidance may evolve as we work toward implementing the new revenue recognition standard if our circumstances change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions our operating result may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock further the new equity investment valuation standard which requires most equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income may increase the volatility of our earnings 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report news about us and our financial results news about our competitors and their results and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us for example during 2017 the closing price of our common stock ranged from 3012 to 4509 per share 

 35 

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

share repurchases under our share repurchase program could increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in 2017 our board of directors approved the increase in the aggregate authorized repurchase amount under our share repurchase program by 7000 million  bringing the total authorization to 10 billion share repurchases under our share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock increase stock price volatility and diminish our cash reserves in addition an announcement of the reduction suspension or termination of our share repurchase program could result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

 36 

however these antitakeover provisions will not have the effect of preventing activist stockholders from seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as nominating board candidates and requesting that we pursue strategic combinations or other transactions these actions could disrupt our operations be costly and timeconsuming and divert the attention of our management and employees in addition perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of activist stockholder actions could result in the loss of potential business opportunities as well as other negative business consequences actions of an activist stockholder may also cause fluctuations in our stock price based on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect our business further we may incur significant expenses in retaining professionals to advise and assist us on activist stockholder matters including legal financial communications advisors and solicitation experts which may negatively impact our future financial results

we have four current focus areas for our business first we derive a majority of product sales from our fortigate network security appliances we continue to develop and improve our offerings which provide opportunities for market share gains second the fortinet security fabric has been developed to provide unified security across the entire digital attack surface including network core endpoints applications data centers access and private and public cloud and is designed to enable traditionally disparate security devices to work together as an integrated and collaborative whole as a result of the increased success in selling the security fabric billings for nonfortigate products and services grew significantly in 2017 third cloud security provides opportunity for growth and was one of the fastest growing parts of our business in 2017 we help customers secure their cloud implementations by offering integration visibility and automation across multicloud and hybrid deployments our forticasb extends the core capabilities of our security fabric architecture to provide businesses the same level of cybersecurity and threat intelligence in cloud environments as they do on their physical networks the fortinet cloud security is available across all major cloud providers including microsoft azure amazon web services google cloud ibm cloud and oracle cloud fourth the emergence of the iot has created an environment where data move freely between devices across locations network environments remote offices mobile workers and public cloud environments making it difficult to consistently track and secure 

financial highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our revenue growth was driven by the strength in sales of our fortigate and nonfortigate products and the sale of new and the renewal and upgrade of existing forticare technical support and fortiguard security subscription service contracts revenue grew in 2017 as the investment made in sales and marketing enabled us to continue to gain enterprise customers 

 42 

we continue to see a shift in our revenue mix from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues reflecting our success in driving higherpriced subscription bundles and services on a geographic basis revenue continues to be diversified globally which remains a key strength of our business 

  

the percentage of our fortigaterelated billings from highend products increased from 38  in 2016 to 39  in 2017 and the percentage of our fortigaterelated billings from midrange products increased from 28  in 2016 to 30  in 2017 the percentage of our fortigaterelated billings from entrylevel products decreased to 31  in 2017 from 34 in 2016 the sale of nonfortigate products also grew significantly in 2017 we also saw more deals that included multiple fortinet products in physical virtual and cloud environments 

in 2017  operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3 percentage points compared to 2016  the decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue headcount increased by 9 to 5066 employees and contractors as of december 31 2017 up from 4665 as of december 31 2016 

business model 

our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products software licenses and services directly to distributors which sell to resellers and service providers which in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to large service providers and major systems integrators we also offer our products across all major cloud providers including amazon web services microsoft azure google cloud ibm cloud and oracle cloud while the revenue from such sales are still relatively insignificant they have increased significantly in recent periods on a percentage basis 

typically fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our hardware products and software licenses most frequently as part of a bundle offering that includes hardware and services functionality we generally invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and security and technical support services and the invoice is payable within 30 to 90 days we also invoice certain licenses and services on a monthly basis 

we generally recognize product revenue up front and recognize revenue for the sale of new and the renewal of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts ratably over the term of the service contract we recognize revenue for certain software licenses up front as product revenue and to a lesser extent recognize other software licenses over the term of the agreement as services revenue we recognize the security and support revenue over the service period which is typically one to three years to a lesser extent five years sales of new and renewal services are a source of recurring revenue and increase our deferred revenue balance which has contributed to our positive cash flow from operations we recognize commissions on both product and service sales at the time of sale 

our approach to network security is defined by our spu hardware architecture the spu includes three lines of proprietary asics content processor network processor and the system on a chip the asics are designed for highly efficient execution of computationally intensive tasks including policy enforcement threat detection and encryption as such asicbased solutions can run many security applications simultaneously without a significant reduction in performance 

key metrics 

we monitor a number of key metrics including the key financial metrics set forth below in order to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies the following table summarizes revenue deferred revenue billings nongaap cash cash equivalents and investments net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow nongaap we discuss revenue below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss our cash cash equivalents and investments and net cash provided by operating activities below under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue billings nongaap and free cash flow nongaap are discussed immediately below the following table 

 43 



  

deferred revenue  our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unrecognized portion of service revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual service period we monitor our deferred revenue balance growth and the mix of shortterm and longterm deferred revenue because it represents a significant portion of revenue and free cash flow to be recognized in future periods deferred revenue was 134 billion  as of december 31 2017  an increase of 3010 million  or 29  from december 31 2016  

billings nongaap we define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations during the period we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive future revenue which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business there are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of gaap revenue first billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue and are impacted by the term of security and support agreements second we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding gaap revenue and evaluating billings together with gaap revenue total billings were 180 billion  for 2017 an increase of 19  compared to 152 billion  in 2016 

a reconciliation of billings to revenue the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided below 



free cash flow nongaap  we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures such as purchases of real estate and other property and equipment we believe free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after capital expenditures can be used for strategic opportunities including repurchasing outstanding common stock investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet a limitation of using free cash flow rather than the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash cash equivalents and investments balance for the period because it excludes cash provided by or used for other investing and financing activities management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the cash flow statement and under “—liquidity and capital resources” and by presenting cash flows from investing and financing activities in our reconciliation of free cash flows in addition it is important to note that other companies including companies in our industry may not use free cash flow may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flows as a comparative measure a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided below

components of operating results 

revenue 

we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our products and amortization of amounts included in deferred revenue related to previous sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services we also recognize revenue from sales of software licenses cloud business relationships and providing professional services revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

  

 

 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

 

 

 45 

gross margin  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products product costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products software licenses and services and any excess inventory writeoffs service revenue and software licenses have had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher gross margins compared to product gross margins during 2017  service gross margin benefited from the shift to highermargin service revenue product gross margin was negatively impacted as longer term deals and higher priced service bundles resulted in allocating a lower percentage of contract values to product and allocating a larger percentage of contact values to services as a result the service margin expansion was partially offset by a decline in product gross margin in 2017 we believe our overall gross margin will remain at a relatively comparable level in 2018 

  operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries benefits bonuses stockbased compensation and sales commissions as applicable we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our workforce we expect sales commission expense recognized at the time of sale to decrease as a percentage of revenue due to the adoption of asu 201409—revenue from contracts with customers 

 

 

 

 

interest income  interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in corporate debt securities money market funds certificates of deposit commercial paper us government and agency securities and municipal bonds 

other income expense — net  other income expense—net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign currency exchange remeasurement 

provision for income taxes  we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than us tax rates and may be subject to us income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than in the us research and development tax credits withholding taxes nondeductible stockbased compensation expense and the tax impact of the 2017 tax act 

 46 

in december 2017 the us federal government enacted the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act decreased the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax under gaap changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate as such we provisionally recorded a 479 million expense on the remeasurement of deferred assets due to the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate and a 152 million expense for the onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation related to the 2017 tax act 

our effective tax rate approximates the federal corporate income tax rates plus the impact of state taxes excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense research and development tax credits foreign withholding tax nondeductible stockbased compensation expense foreign income subject to lower tax rates than income earned in the united states deferred tax assets remeasurement and a onetime transition tax 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of the significant accounting policies described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our hardware fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services and other services through our channel partners and a direct sales force 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

  

   

   

 

 

we recognize product revenue for sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to endcustomers upon shipment based on general revenue recognition accounting guidance once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met certain distributors are granted stock rotation rights limited rights of return and rebates for sales of our products the arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not typically fixed or determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sellthrough for sales that include endcustomer acceptance criteria revenue is recognized upon acceptance we recognize software license revenue upon electronic transfer of the license key to the customer historically software license revenue has not been material 

 47 

substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services which consist of security subscriptions and technical support services security services provide access to our antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades maintenance releases and patches telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 

service revenue consists of sales from our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services professional and training services and other services that include saas and iaas both of which are hosted or cloudbased services we recognize revenue from these arrangements as the subscription service is delivered over the term which is typically one year or on a monthly usage basis to date saas and iaas revenues have not represented a significant percentage of our total revenue 

we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances and   record reductions to revenue for rebates and estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs additionally in limited circumstances we may permit endcustomers distributors and resellers to return our products subject to varying limitations for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience 

our sales arrangements typically contain multiple elements such as hardware security subscription technical support services and other services the majority of our hardware appliance products contain our operating system software that together function to deliver the essential functionality of the product our products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price using vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if it exists or thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable we use our best estimate of selling price “besp” for that deliverable revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element revenue is reported net of sales taxes 

  

for our hardware appliances we use besp as our selling price estimate for our support and other services we generally use vsoe as our selling price estimate we determine vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement based on the historical pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately in establishing vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical standalone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe for our support and other services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple historical factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels that fall within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price 

for multipleelement arrangements where software deliverables are included revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the estimated selling price hierarchy the amount allocated to the software deliverables is then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when vsoe of fair value exists if evidence of vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all software allocated revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period the same residual method and vsoe of fair value principles apply for our multiple element arrangements that contain only software elements 

 48 

asu 201409 

on january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” 201409—revenue from contracts with customers which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers the core principle of asu 201409 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services asu 201409 defines a fivestep process to achieve this core principle and accordingly we expect more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than is required under the legacy gaap including identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation asu 201409 permits two methods of adoption retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented the full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application the modified retrospective method we elected to adopt asu 201409 using the modified retrospective method and will apply the standard to contracts that are not completed as of january 1 2018 and will recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit 

we have completed our analysis of open revenue contracts as of january 1 2018 based on our assessment the impact on revenue in our consolidated financial statements is not material the impact on revenue primarily relates to the acceleration of revenue from usbased channel partners that was previously deferred until the product was sold through and certain changes related to revenue recognized on software license sales we expect the pattern of revenue recognition from direct sales of our fortigate and other appliances and fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to be substantially unchanged on an ongoing basis 

commission expense 

we recognize commission expense on both product sales and service contracts at the time of sale under asc 201409 as of january 1 2018 we will continue to expense commissions related to appliance sales when incurred but will capitalize and recognize certain commissions on service contracts over the period of benefit as part of the transition to the new accounting standard we expect to capitalize at least 1300  million of sales commissions that have been determined to be the remaining costs to obtain then existing service contracts capitalized sales commissions will be amortized on a straightline basis over the period of benefit for new business or the contract term for renewals see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

stockbased compensation 

employee stock options  we estimate the fair value of employee stock options awarded to our employees using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model for all employee stock options we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method our option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term riskfree interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock the assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment a 10 change in any of these assumptions would not have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

employee stock purchase plan  we estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” using the blackscholes pricing model and we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method the pricing model requires the input of the fair value of our common stock and assumptions including the expected term of the award expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock our espp provides for consecutive sixmonth offering periods and we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of espp shares a 10 change in any of these assumptions would not have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

 49 

valuation of inventory 

as of december 31 2016 inventory was recorded at the lower of cost or market on january 1 2017 we adopted asu 201511—inventory simplifying the measurement of inventory as such as of december 31 2017 inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value adoption of asu 201511 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements cost is computed using the firstin firstout method in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record additional inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

business combinations 

we include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill we often continue to gather additional information throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded such charges are recorded in the period in which they are identified 

restructuring 

our restructuring expenses consist of severance and other onetime benefits contract terminations and other expenses liabilities for costs associated with a restructuring activity are measured at fair value onetime termination benefits are expensed at the date we notify the employee unless the employee must provide future service in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period a liability for terminating a contract before the end of its term which termination is usually done by giving written notice to the counterparty within the notification period specified by the contract or by otherwise negotiating a termination with the counterparty is recognized at fair value on the notification date a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity is recognized at the ceaseuse date other costs primarily consist of asset writeoffs which are expensed when incurred 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in addition deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of the position that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

in december 2017 the us federal government enacted the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime transition tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax under us gaap changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the 2017 tax act we have recorded provisional estimates associated with the 2017 tax act we consider both the recognition of the transition tax and the remeasurement of deferred income taxes incomplete new guidance from regulators interpretation of the law and refinement of our estimates from ongoing analysis of data and tax positions may change the provisional amounts 

 50 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets would be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted 

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 



 51 



2017  and 2016   

revenue 



 52 

total revenue increased by 2195 million  or 17  in 2017  compared to 2016  we continued to experience global diversification of revenue in 2017 revenue from all our regions grew with the americas contributing the largest portion of our revenue growth both on an absolute dollar and on a percentage basis product revenue increased by 291 million  or 5  in 2017 compared to 2016  the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family across all product categories and in particular for our highend and midrange products for large enterprise customers sales of nonfortigate products such as the fortinet security fabric and cloud products also grew significantly service revenue increased by 1904 million  or 26  in 2017  compared to 2016  the increase in service revenue was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods we continue to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues which reflect our ongoing success in driving sales of highend and midrange products and tend to include more security subscriptions and support services as well as longer contract durations 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



total gross margin increased by 07  percentage points in 2017  compared to 2016  driven by higher margin on service revenue service gross margin increased by 23  percentage points during 2017 as compared to 2016 product gross margin decreased by 41  percentage points in 2017  compared to 2016  during 2017  service gross margin benefited from the shift to highermargin service revenue product gross margin was negatively impacted by longer term deals and higher priced service bundles resulting in lower product revenue recognized in 2017 and higher deferred revenue for services that will be recognized in future periods and as a result of product costs being recognized upon shipment as a result the service margin expansion was partially offset by a decline in product gross margin in 2017 total cost of product revenue was comprised primarily of direct and indirect cost of products sold inventory reserves and other charges cost of service revenue was comprised primarily of personnel costs 

operating expenses 

  



 53 

research and development 

research and development expense increased by 275 million  or 15  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to an increase of 176 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products in addition product development costs such as thirdparty testing and prototypes increased by 62 million and depreciation and other occupancyrelated costs increased by 31 million we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization and expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2018 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 745 million  or 12  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to an increase of 551 million in personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales and marketing headcount in order to drive continued market share gains globally marketingrelated expense increased by 119 million as we invested significantly in marketing programs to drive broader market awareness build lead generation programs and accelerate pipeline in addition depreciation expense and other occupancyrelated expense increased by 68 million as a percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expense decreased as revenue grew at a higher pace compared to personnel costs we intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure and marketing strategy which are critical to support growth and expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2018 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 68 million  or 8  in 2017  compared to 2016  personnel costs increased by 85 million as we continued to increase headcount in order to support our expanding business professional fees increased by 106 million primarily due to the implementation of a new revenue recognition system and a litigation settlement expense of 18 million the increase in expense was partially offset by a decrease in thirdparty costs of 134 million related to the substantial completion of our erp system implementation in 2016 we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars in 2018 

  

restructuring 

restructuring expenses of 03 million  and 40 million  in 2017 and 2016 respectively primarily relate to our restructuring activities to improve operating efficiencies due to the acquisition of accelops and certain other activities see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details including the types of expenses incurred and cash payments made 

operating margin 

we generated operating income of 1098 million in 2017 an increase of 669 million or 156 compared to 429 million in 2016 the improvement in operating margin was primarily due to the improvement in gross margin and the decline in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue as a percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased to 47 in 2017 from 49 in 2016 

interest income and other income expense — net 

  



interest income increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to higher interest rates on invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments interest income varies depending on our average investment balances during the period types and mix of investments and market interest rates the change in other income expense—net in 2017 as compared to 2016 was the result of a gain of approximately 10 million for foreign currency exchange gains in 2017 compared to a loss of 66 million in 2016 due primarily to changes in the value of euro relative to the us dollar 

 54 

provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 75  for 2017  compared to an effective tax rate of 25  for 2016  the provision for income taxes for 2017  was comprised primarily of us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes an increase in tax reserves remeasurement of deferred tax assets and a onetime transition tax 

in december 2017 the us federal government enacted the 2017 tax act the 2017 tax act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and created a territorial tax system with a onetime mandatory tax on foreign earnings of us subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax under gaap changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate 

the sec staff has issued staff accounting bulletin no 118  “ sab 118” which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the 2017 tax act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the 2017 tax act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the 2017 tax act 

the increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily due to the deferred tax assets remeasurement and a onetime transition tax due to the 2017 tax act excluding the tax impact from the 2017 tax act the 2017 effective tax rate would have been 24 which was relatively consistent with 2016 in 2016 due to the early adoption of asu 201609 approximately 108 million of excess tax benefits were recognized in the income tax provision in 2017 135 million of excess tax benefits was included in the income tax provision 

it is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2017 we had accrued 135 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of 95 million as of december 31 2016 

it is reasonably possible that our gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to 120 million in the next 12 months primarily due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and audit settlement these adjustments if recognized would positively impact our effective tax rate and would be recognized as additional tax benefits 

 55 

2016  and 2015   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased by 2662 million or 26 in 2016 compared to 2015 we continued to experience global diversification of revenue in 2016 revenue from all our regions grew with emea contributing the largest portion of our revenue growth both on an absolute dollar and on a percentage basis product revenue increased by 713 million or 15 in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family across all product categories and in particular for our highend and midrange products for large enterprise customers sales of nonfortigate products also grew significantly service revenue increased by 1948 million or 37 in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in service revenue was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods we started to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues which reflected our ongoing success in driving sales of service bundles 

  

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



  

total gross margin increased by 19 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015 as both product and service gross margins increased product gross margin increased by 18 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015 product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as certain of our virtualized security solutions and by lower warranty related costs and was partially offset by higher inventory reserves 

service gross margin increased during 2016 as compared to 2015 as we scaled efficiencies resulting from an increased mix on highermargin service revenue cost of service revenue was comprised primarily of personnel costs 

  

 56 

operating expenses 

  



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 250 million or 16 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase of 190 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products depreciation and other occupancyrelated costs increased by 66 million 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 1561 million or 33 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase of 1223 million in personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales and marketing headcount in order to drive continued market share gains globally in addition depreciation expense and other occupancyrelated expense increased by 140 million and travel and entertainment expense increased by 81 million marketingrelated expense increased by 76   million as we invested significantly in marketing programs particularly in the large enterprise market including costs related to trade shows and lead generation as a percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expense increased as we accelerated the investment in our sales force and marketing programs to drive future growth 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 96 million or 13 in 2016 compared to 2015 personnel costs increased by 96 million as we continued to increase headcount in order to support our expanding business and erp implementation during 2016 we expensed 78 million of thirdparty costs relating to the implementation and maintenance of the erp system implementation compared to 54 million in 2015 these increases were partially offset by lower professional fees of 67 million in 2016 

  

restructuring 

restructuring expenses of 40 million in 2016 primarily relate to our restructuring activities to improve operating efficiencies due to the acquisition of accelops and certain other activities restructuring charges of 76 million during 2015 relate to restructuring activities in connection with the meru acquisition see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details including the types of expenses incurred and cash payments made 

operating margin 

we generated operating income of 429 million in 2016 an increase of 280 million or 189 compared to operating income of 149 million in 2015 the improvement in operating margin was primarily due to the improvement in gross margin and the decline in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue as a percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses decreased to 6 in 2016 from 7 in 2015 

 57 

interest income and other income expense — net 

  



interest income increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to higher interest earned on invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments interest income varies depending on our average investment balances during the period types and mix of investments and market interest rates the increase in other expense—net in 2016 as compared to 2015 was the result of higher foreign currency exchange losses 

provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 25 for 2016 compared with an effective tax rate of 53 for 2015 the provision for income taxes for 2016 was comprised primarily of us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes an increase in tax reserves as well as transfer pricing allocations that impact jurisdictional income taxed at various tax rates the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits for income tax provision from the adoption of asu 201609 in 2016 due to the early adoption of asu 201609 approximately 108 million of excess tax benefits were recognized in the income tax provision in 2015 there were no excess tax benefits included in the income tax provision 

it is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2016 we had accrued 95 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of 55 million as of december 31 2015 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend which has positively impacted billings and product revenue activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential customer buying which results in lower billings and product revenue although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

consistent with the seasonality note above our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has generally increased sequentially in each quarter except in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 product revenue on average throughout the year increased in 2017  as compared to the same quarters in 2016  which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales and marketing organizations to a robust security market and to continued product innovation we continue to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues which reflect our ongoing success in driving sales of midrange and highend service bundles richer service offerings and the average contract length 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services and among products product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products in 2017 product gross margin was impacted by the shift toward highermargin subscription bundles and longer duration of service contracts service gross margin benefited from the shift to highermargin service revenue 

 60 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as by our stock repurchases real estate and other capital expenditures proceeds associated with stock option exercises and issuances of common stock under our espp payment of taxes in connection with the net settlement of equity awards and business acquisitions in recent years we have received significant capital resources as a result of increases in our deferred revenue and the proceeds from exercise of stock options and purchases under our espp additional increases in deferred revenue may depend on a number of factors including our billing growth rate service contract renewal rates and length of initial and renewals service contracts we expect proceeds from the issuance of stock options in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units granted versus stock options and also to vary based on our share price as of december 31 2017 4428 million  remained available for future share repurchase under the repurchase program 

we currently expect to spend 900 million to 1200 million for 2018 in capital expenditures primarily related to expansion of our offices to support worldwide growth 

as of december 31 2017  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 135 billion  were invested primarily in corporate debt securities money market fund certificate of deposits commercial paper and us government and agency securities it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital provides liquidity and maximizes return without significantly increasing risk 

as of december 31 2017  8480 million  of our cash and investments were held by our international subsidiaries under the 2017 tax act signed into law in december 2017 starting on january 1 2018 we are no longer subject to federal income tax on earnings remitted from our foreign subsidiaries we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation and have determined that we will be repatriating certain unremitted foreign earnings which was previously deemed indefinitely reinvested for those investments from which we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation we have recorded a provisional estimate for withholding and state taxes we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and amount of our planned share repurchases the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity the continuing market acceptance of our products and our investments in real estate through purchases or longterm leases historically we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs share repurchases capital expenditures and acquisition activities in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected

operating activities 

cash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity it is primarily comprised of net income as adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities including deferred revenue noncash adjustments consist primarily of stockbased compensation depreciation of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets and amortization of investment premiums 

  

 our operating activities during 2017 provided 5944 million  in cash as a result of our continued growth of our business and our ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable we continue to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues and longer duration contracts for example our total revenue grew 17 in 2017 compared to 2016 while our total deferred revenue balance grew 29 

our operating activities during 2016 provided 3457 million in cash as a result of our continued growth of our business and the ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical supports to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and payments for inventory purchases we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues for example our total revenue grew 26 in 2016 compared to 2015 while our total deferred revenue balance grew 31 

our operating activities during 2015 provided 2825 million in cash as a result of our continued growth in billings and the ability to successfully manage our working capital additionally in 2015 we received 90 million related to a mutual threeyear covenantnottosue agreement changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in payments received from customers partially offset by an increase in payments to vendors 

investing activities 

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments purchases of property and equipment and payments made in connection with business acquisitions historically in making a lease versus purchase decision related to our larger facilities we have considered various factors including financial metrics and the impact on our employees in certain cases we have elected to purchase the facility if we believe that purchasing rather than leasing is more in line with our longterm strategy we expect to make similar decisions in the future 

during 2017 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the 1353 million  we spent on capital expenditures including our purchases of real estate properties in canada and sunnyvale california for total cash of 1072 million the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities net of purchases from our investments of 585 million  

during 2016 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 672 million we spent on capital expenditures including our purchases of a warehouse in union city california for total cash of 185 million and a 221 million payment for the acquisition of accelops the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities net of purchases from our investments of 151 million 

during 2015 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 380 million used for the acquisition of meru in addition we spent 374 million on capital expenditures including our purchases of certain real properties in sunnyvale california and sophia france for total cash of 139 million the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities net of purchases from our investments of 744 million 

financing activities 

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan and the espp taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and repurchase and retirement of common stock 

 62 

during 2017 cash used for financing activities was 4156 million  primarily due to 4463 million  used to repurchase our common stock this was partially offset by 307 million  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of tax withholding 

during 2016 cash used for financing activities was 1059 million primarily due to 1108 million used to repurchase our common stock this was partially offset by 66 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of tax withholding 

during 2015 cash used for financing activities was 216 million primarily due to 600 million used to repurchase our common stock this was partially offset by 384 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of tax withholding 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  

  



 

 

in addition to commitments with contract manufacturers we have open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received goods or services as of december 31 2017  we had 68 million in other contractual commitments having a remaining term in excess of one year that may not be cancelable 

as of december 31 2017  we had 902 million  of longterm tax liabilities including interest related to uncertain tax positions because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during 2017  2016  and 2015  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities including corporate debt securities money market funds commercial paper municipal bonds us government and agency securities certificates of deposit and term deposits the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2017  2016  and 2015  would have resulted in an insignificant decrease in our interest income in each of these periods 

 63 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the united states are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar “cad” the euro “eur” and the british pound “gbp” to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to minimize the impact of balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the credit worthiness of these parties these contracts typically have a maturity of one month we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts as other expense in the consolidated statement of operations we recognized an expense of 10 million  in other income expense—net in 2017  due to foreign currency transaction gains 

our use of forward exchange contracts is intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements are relatively shortterm in nature and are focused on the cad longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar against other foreign currencies such as the eur and gbp could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 55 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash balances as of december 31 2017 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

manufacturing and suppliers 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers our current manufacturing partners include microstar international co wistron corporation flextronics international ltd senao networks inc adlink technology inc and a number of taiwanbased manufacturers we submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured the delivery date and other delivery terms once our products are manufactured they are sent to either our warehouse in california or to our logistics partner in taoyuan city taiwan where accessory packaging and qualitycontrol testing are performed we believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to focus resources on our core competencies our proprietary spus which are the key to the performance of our appliances are built by contract manufacturers including faraday technology corporation “faraday” kawasaki microelectronics america inc “kmicro” and renesas electronics corporation “renesas” these contract manufacturers use foundries operated by either united microelectronics corporation “umc” or taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited “tsmc” or their own foundry such as renesas’ fab 

the components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or more frequently by our contract manufacturers some of the components important to our business including specific types of cpus from intel corporation “intel” network chips from broadcom corporation “broadcom” marvell technology group ltd “marvell” and intel and solidstate drives siliconbased storage devices from intel adata technology co ltd “adata” ocz technology group inc “ocz” samsung electronics co ltd “samsung” and western digital technologies inc “western digital” are available from a limited or sole source of supply 

we have no longterm contracts related to the manufacturing of our asics or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms 

research and development 

we focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and systems and adding new features to existing products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that are or are expected to be important to our endcustomers our success in designing developing manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors including the identification of market demand for new products product selection timely implementation of product design and development product performance effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing 

intellectual property 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology as of december 31 2016  we had 358 issued united states “us” and foreign patents and 292 pending us and foreign patent applications we also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms 

despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the us and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the us 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights third parties have asserted are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected we typically indemnify our endcustomers distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties

seasonality 

for information regarding seasonality in our sales see the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—quarterly results of operations—seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

• our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and technological expertise 

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

• brand recognition 

• customer service and support 

• sales and distribution capabilities 

• size and financial stability of operations and 

• breadth of product line 

among others our competitors include check point software technologies ltd “check point” cisco systems inc “cisco” f5 networks inc “f5 networks” fireeye inc “fireeye” intel juniper networks inc “juniper” palo alto networks inc “palo alto networks” sonicwall inc “sonicwall” sophos group plc “sophos” and symantec corporation “symantec” 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance reliability and breadth our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance market their products better or achieve greater market acceptance than us in addition our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  our total headcount was 4665  employees and contractors none of our us employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in certain european countries have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain uptodate union membership we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors may lose some or all of their investment 

risks related to our business   

our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control or may be difficult to predict including 

  

   

   

 

   

 

   

 

 

   

   

   

   

   

   



 9 

  

 

 

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 10 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could 

face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature over the near term accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global economic conditions and spending environments weak economic conditions in certain geographies or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our channel partners reduced unit sales and slower or declining growth 

our billings revenue and free cash flow growth may slow or may not continue 

  

  billings revenue and free cash flow growth may slow or we may experience a decrease in billings revenue and free cash flow for a number of reasons including a slowdown in demand for our products or services a shift in demand from products to services increased competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market or softness in demand in certain geographies or industry verticals such as the service provider industry and our failure for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities and due to other risks identified in the risk factors described in this periodic report our expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expected and if our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings and revenue growth we may experience margin declines and may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue do not appropriately manage our cost structure and free cash flow or encounter unanticipated liabilities any failure by us to maintain profitability maintain our margins and continue our billings revenue and free cash flow growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

we rely significantly on revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services which may decline and because we recognize revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue revenue from the sale of new or from the renewal of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in purchases of fortigate appliances changes in the sales mix between products and services endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors reductions in our customers’ spending levels and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to these arrangements if our sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business could suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact our billings and revenue furthermore we recognize fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically from one to three years and in some instances has been as long as five years as a result much of the fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts entered into during previous quarters or years consequently a decline in new or renewed fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services is not reflected in full in our statements of operations until future periods our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

 11 

  

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the us and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world our international sales have represented a majority of our total revenue in recent periods therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

 

 

 

 

   

 

   

product and service sales and employee and contractor matters may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change over time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in litigation regulatory action costs of investigation delays in revenue recognition delays in financial reporting financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or 

 12 

exportation of our products and services any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large enterprises and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations while we have increased sales in recent periods to large and mediumsized enterprises and service providers our sales volume varies by quarter we also have experienced less traction selling to certain government organizations and there can be no assurance that we will be successful selling to these customers sales to these organizations involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller entities these risks include 

  

   

 

   

 

 

   

large enterprises and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases longer than 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with endcustomers along with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales in addition product purchases by large enterprises and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays furthermore service providers represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business large enterprises and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability expect a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors in addition large enterprises and mediumsized businesses service providers and government organizations may require that our products and services be sold differently from how we offer our products and services which could negatively impact our operating results our large enterprise and service provider customers may also become more deliberate in their purchases as they plan their nextgeneration network security architecture leading them to take more time in making purchasing decisions or to purchase based only on their immediate needs all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers in addition if sales expected from a large and mediumsized endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders or not place orders commensurate with our expectations if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products and accurately forecasting inventory requirements and demand can be challenging our channel partners also may adjust their 

 13 

orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture or ship certain products increases for any reason inventory shortfalls could result management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell 

  

in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements or excess inventory levels if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have in the past experienced inventory shortages and excesses due to the variance in demand for certain products from forecasted amounts if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder chairman and chief executive officer and michael xie our cofounder president and chief technology officer and any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives the loss of the services or distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering sales and marketing may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we experience turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highlyskilled personnel is frequently intense especially for qualified employees in network security and especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel such as the san francisco bay area and vancouver canada we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information changes in immigration laws including changes to the rules regarding h1b visas may also harm our ability to attract personnel from other countries 

if we do not increase the effectiveness of our sales organization in some regions we may have difficulty adding new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomers and our business may be adversely affected 

although we have a channel sales model members of our sales organization often engage in direct interaction with our prospective endcustomers therefore we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales organization to obtain new endcustomers and sell additional products and services to our existing endcustomers there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to grow our revenue depends in large part on our success in recruiting training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth and on the effectiveness of those personnel new hires require substantial training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business for example we realigned our sales organization in early 2016 and it has taken more time than we expected to ramp up the productivity of our realigned sales organization which negatively impacted our revenue growth in the third quarter of 2016 in some regions furthermore hiring sales personnel in new countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if the sales personnel fail to achieve full productivity if our new sales employees do not become fully productive on the timelines that we have projected our revenue will not increase at anticipated levels and our ability to achieve long term 

 14 

projections may be negatively impacted if we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new endcustomers or increasing sales to our existing customer base our business operating results and prospects will be adversely affected 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts or promotional programs we offer a change in our mix of products and services and anticipation of the introduction of new products and services competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or services or may bundle them with other products or services additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions have in the past and may in the future negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products or services will decrease over product life cycles we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product and service offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter for example in 2016 the portion of billings during the last two weeks of the quarter was 37 and   on average over the past eight quarters our billings during the last two weeks accounted for 35 of aggregate billings for each quarter if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our logistics partners’ inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter our failure to accurately forecast our inventory requirements and to appropriately manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing any delays in shipments due to trade compliance requirements labor disputes or logistics changes at shipping ports or otherwise our billings and revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products and to improve lead generation and sales enablement our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large enterprise service provider and government organization market we have historically had relatively low spending on marketing activities while we have increased our investments in sales and marketing it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased revenue if our investments in additional sales personnel or if our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market awareness of our company and products and increased lead generation or if we experience turnover and disruption in our sales and marketing teams we will not be able to achieve sustained growth and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

  

a significant portion of our sales is generated through a limited number of distributors and substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners including distributors and resellers we depend upon our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities and manage the sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and if we are unable to keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

 15 

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products and incentivize them to sell our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services and may purchase more inventory than they can sell our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions in addition if our channel partners’ financial condition or operations weaken it could negatively impact their ability to sell our product and services our channel partners may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products they may also have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot ensure that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results during 2014 2015 and 2016 exclusive which distributed our solutions to a large group of resellers and endcustomers accounted for 15  18  and 20  of our total revenue respectively in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach or misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

  

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks different customers deploy and use our products in different ways and certain deployments and usages may subject our products to adverse conditions that may negatively impact the effectiveness and useful lifetime of our products we cannot ensure that our products will prevent all security threats because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard security subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard security subscription services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortigate appliances and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of our customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products and services and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized thirdparty any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in

our business and operations have experienced growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth including through the expansion of our real estate holdings or are unable to improve our systems and processes our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

our business has grown over the last several years we rely heavily on information technology and accounting systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews certain of these systems were developed by us for our internal use and as such may have a higher risk of failure or not receive the same level of support as systems purchased from and supported by external technology companies in addition we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on manual data entry   of customer purchase orders received through email and to a lesser extent through electronic data interchange   from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a large amount of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter a significant interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased billings and revenue for that quarter 

to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial operating and administrative systems and controls and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems controls and processes such as system capacity access and change management controls in a timely or efficient manner our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner whether as a result of the significant growth of our business or otherwise may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses moreover the failure of our systems and processes could undermine our ability to provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results and could impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our productivity and the quality of our products and services may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations 

further it may be necessary to expand our real estate holdings to meet our projected growing need for office space we recently approved plans to purchase office buildings in vancouver and ottawa canada and we are considering plans to significantly expand our headquarters in sunnyvale california these plans will require significant capital expenditure over the next several years and involve certain risks including impairment charges and acceleration of depreciation changes in future business strategy that may decrease the need for expansion such as a decrease in headcount and with respect to our potential expansion plans in california risks related to construction future changes in growth or fluctuations in cash flow may also negatively impact our ability to pay for these projects additionally inaccuracies in our projected capital expenditures could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

  

we may experience difficulties maintaining and expanding our new enterprise resource planning “erp” system 

  

we recently implemented a new erp system the erp system is critical to our ability to provide important information to our management obtain and deliver products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations accurately maintain books and records provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results   and otherwise operate our business erp system implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system any such transformation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system including potential disruption to our normal operations the implementation and maintenance of the new erp system has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources in addition we may choose to upgrade or expand the functionality of our erp system leading to additional costs we may also discover deficiencies in our design or implementation or maintenance of the new erp system that could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations accurately maintain books and records provide accurate 

 17 

timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business additionally if the system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition and sales return reserves stockbased compensation expense valuation of inventory investments accounting for business combination goodwill and other longlived assets restructuring accounting for income taxes and litigation and settlement costs 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners including faraday kmicro and renesas our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers in asia and elsewhere reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance and product costs supply and timing any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production or shipping interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages quality problems or strike or other labor disruption at one of our manufacturing partners or locations or at shipping ports or locations would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary spu which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and tsmc on a purchase order basis and umc and tsmc do not guarantee any capacity and 

 18 

could reject orders or could try to increase pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary or long term inventory shortages of our spu as well as increased costs our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes or more profitable products if any of these manufacturers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics our business would be harmed 

  

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances directive “rohs” adopted in the european union the “eu” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals” that are contained in our products have originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 “doddfrank” the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage or loss of sales and customers or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins 

  

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of cpus from intel network chips from broadcom marvell and intel and memory devices from intel adata ocz samsung and western digital the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

 

   

   

   

   

   

 19 

   

the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the us these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the british pound additionally fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar may negatively impact our real estate purchase and development plans in vancouver and ottawa while we are not currently engaged in material hedging activities we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts through the use of forward exchange contracts if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currencydenominated operating expenses in addition a strengthening of the us dollar may increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the us which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business could subject us to fines and penalties and could also cause us to lose endcustomers in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety product labelling environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws import and export controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the us noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations sanctions enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages and civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

selling our solutions to the us government whether directly or through channel partners also subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements failure to comply with these requirements by either us or our channel partners could subject us to investigations fines other penalties and damages which could have an adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and prospects as an example the us department of justice “doj” on its own behalf or on behalf of the general services administration “gsa” as well as individuals has in the past pursued claims against reached financial settlements with or otherwise obtained damages from companies that sell electronic equipment and from it vendors under the false claims act and other statutes related to pricing discount practices and compliance with laws related to sales to the federal government such as the trade agreements act the doj continues to actively pursue such claims violations of certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or debarred from   future government contracting any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our revenue operating results financial condition and prospects 

these laws and regulations impose added costs on our business and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements including noncompliance in the past could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners penalties termination of contracts loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting any such damages penalties disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 20 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales and could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

  

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required export license or through an export license exception and may be prohibited altogether from export to certain countries if we were to fail to comply with us export laws us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits for example for stocking orders placed by our partners we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

  

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

efforts to withdraw from or materially modify nafta or other international trade agreements to change tax provisions related to global manufacturing and sales or to impose new tariffs economic sanctions or related legislation any of which could our adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement “nafta” and we also rely on various us corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we develop market and sell our products and services globally efforts to withdraw from or materially modify nafta or other international trade agreements or to change corporate tax policy related to international commerce could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as could the continuing uncertainty regarding whether such actions will be taken moreover efforts to implement changes related to export or import regulations including the imposition of new border taxes or tariffs on foreign imports economic sanctions or related policies any modification in these areas any shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or any change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential endcustomers with international operations and could result in increased costs any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products laws relating to our real property and future expansion plans and laws concerning the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the us and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

  

 21 

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the near future if this exemption is revoked if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

  

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to government organizations sales to government organizations are subject to a number of risks selling to government organizations can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense with long sales cycles and without any assurance of winning a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

 

 

 

 

the rules and regulations applicable to sales to government organizations may also negatively impact sales to other organizations to date we have had limited traction in sales to us federal government agencies and any future sales to government organizations is uncertain government organizations may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such government organization the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the us and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

  

false detection of vulnerabilities viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

  

our antivirus and our intrusion prevention services may falsely detect viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and 

 22 

other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our antispam and antimalware services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures in addition our threat researchers periodically identify vulnerabilities in various thirdparty products and if these identifications are perceived to be incorrect or are in fact incorrect this could harm our business any such false identification or perceived false identification of important files applications or vulnerabilities could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

if our internal network system or our website is compromised public perception of our products and services will be harmed we may become subject to liability and our business operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted 

our success depends on the market’s confidence in our ability to provide effective network security protection despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal network system and website we are still vulnerable to computer viruses breakins phishing attacks attempts to overload our servers with denialofservice and other cyberattacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our internal network system or our website our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance or otherwise and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to transfer funds or disclose information in order to gain access to our network and confidential information we cannot guarantee that the measures we have taken to protect our network and website will provide absolute security moreover because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers although we have not yet experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network or website an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems or website could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services and investor confidence in our company any breach of our network system or website could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to our endcustomers lead to interruptions or system slowdowns cause loss of critical data or lead to the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential proprietary or sensitive information we could also be subject to liability and litigation and reputational harm and our channel partners and endcustomers may be harmed lose confidence in us and decrease or cease using our products and services any breach of our internal network system or our website could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and stock price 

  

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

  

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners and other third parties to resolve any issues relating to our products if we our channel partners or other third parties do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many large endcustomers service provider and government organization endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers because of their more complex deployments if we our channel partners or other third parties fail to meet the requirements of our larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with large enterprises service providers and government organizations as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of our subsidiaries are organized our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

  

 23 

 

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

 

   

   

significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the financial accounting standards board standard in addition the standard applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain foreign countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities tax authorities in france are currently examining the intercompany relationship between fortinet inc fortinet france and fortinet singapore we are in the early stages of this inquiry and as of yet no official audit has been opened we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

although we currently do not have a valuation allowance we may in the future be required to establish one we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

  

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates in a given jurisdiction differs from our estimate our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations additionally our actual tax rate may be subject to further uncertainty due to potential changes in us and foreign tax rules 

  

 24 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development the “oecd” an international association comprised of 34 countries including the us has been working on a base erosion and profit sharing project as part of this project the oecd issued in 2015 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business due to our extensive international business activities any changes in the taxation of such activities could increase our tax obligations in many countries and may increase our worldwide effective tax rate 

  

in addition we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities if tax authorities challenge the relative mix of us and international income our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

  

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products or technologies and intellectual property such as patents for example we closed our acquisitions of meru and accelops in the third quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016 respectively for any past acquisition or possible future acquisition we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property and sales force into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines integrating reporting systems and procedures and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies for example we may experience difficulties integrating an acquired company’s erp system sales and support processes and systems and other processes and systems with our current systems and processes our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property could significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

  

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products 

 25 

and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the us or other countries and in some circumstances we may be required to indemnify a customer in full without a limitation on liability for certain liabilities including potential liabilities that are not contractually limited the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not cover such claim at all or may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

  

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest labor disruption and terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire power outage flood or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity and our research and development and data office center in vancouver canada is subject to the risk of flooding and is also in a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products or assisting with shipments on a timely basis as well as our customers’ ability to order from us and our employees’ ability to perform their duties in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in our missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability civil unrest labor disruptions acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or of the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at the end of each quarter any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of customer orders or in the delay of the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

  

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

moreover business models based on softwareasaservice “saas” and infrastructureasaservice “iaas” both of which are hosted or cloudbased services have become increasingly indemand by our endcustomers and adopted by other providers including our competitors while part of our platform is cloudbased most of our platform is currently deployed on

premise and therefore if customers demand that our platform be provided through a saas or iaas business model we would be required to make additional investments in our infrastructure and personnel to be able to more fully provide our platform through a saas or iaas model in order to maintain the competitiveness of our platform such investments may involve expanding our data centers servers and networks and increasing our technical operations and engineering teams these risks are compounded by the uncertainty concerning the future viability of saas and iaas business models and the future demand for such models by customers additionally if we are unable to meet the demand to provide our services through a saas or iaas model we may lose customers to competitors 

our uniform resource locator “url” database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’  expectations 

  

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations could impair the growth of our business 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

  

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products in order to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   



 27 

  

   

   

   

   

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

demand for our products may be limited by market perception that individual products from one vendor that provide multiple layers of security protection in one product are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of many of our products depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality in one appliance if the market for these products fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view “allinone” network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that such products of ours provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform our solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of our product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that “allinone” solutions may be suitable only for small and mediumsized businesses because such solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large enterprise service provider and government organization endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with our market in general demand for multisecurity functionality products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include companies such as check point cisco f5 networks fireeye intel juniper palo alto networks sonicwall sophos and symantec 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 28 

   

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions as a result of such acquisitions competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco f5 networks and juniper offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the us are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a 

 29 

timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the us may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot guarantee that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the us and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the us from time to time legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license the gnu lesser public license the bsd license the apache license the mit x license and the mozilla public license from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which requirements could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties are currently asserting have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they have also asserted such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we may indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a thirdparty even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies nonpracticing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

 30 

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes as well as general commercial litigation and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion 

we have several ongoing patent lawsuits several nonpracticing entity patent holding companies have sent us letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and organizations have sent letters demanding that we provide indemnification for patent claims given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sarbanesoxley” doddfrank and other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these requirements as well as proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations sarbanesoxley requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly although our most recent assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2016 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2017 or future periods we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

  

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

  

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing or new accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition which are effective for us beginning on january 1 2018 and accounting for leases as well as the significant costs that may be incurred to adopt and to comply with these new pronouncements could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which would have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our reporting obligations 

 31 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report news about us and our financial results news about our competitors and their results and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us or announcements regarding any stock repurchase programs and the timing and amount of shares we purchase under such programs for example during 2016 the closing price of our common stock ranged from 2383 to 3717 per share 

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

 32 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

business overview 

we provide high performance cybersecurity solutions to a wide variety of enterprises service providers and government organizations of all sizes across the globe including a majority of the 2016 fortune 100 our cybersecurity solutions are designed to provide broad rapid protection against dynamic and sophisticated security threats while simplifying the it and security infrastructure of our endcustomers 

the evolving cyber threat environment is unprecedented both in terms of volume and sophistication of attacks as a result cybersecurity has increased both in priority and in management complexity for organizations of all sizes especially enterprises in addition the growth of iot devices and the decision by organizations to increasingly move computing and infrastructure resources to the cloud necessitate increased visibility and security orchestration across a widely distributed ecosystem of networks our common operating system centralized management and open application program interfaces allow many of the solutions in our portfolio as well as those of our partner community to be combined to create an integrated security architecture the fortinet security fabric is designed to address sophisticated threats and nextgeneration environments including iot and the cloud the fortinet security fabric connects our products services and ecosystem partner solutions to help provide visibility and protection at all points in the network from endpoint to data center to the cloud regardless of whether deployed in physical virtual or hybrid cloud environments or on endpoint devices the fortinet security fabric delivers integrated scalability access control awareness security traffic segmentation centralized management and orchestration the fortinet security fabric is built around an open framework to ensure interoperability and synchronization of intelligence and response and does so across the distributed network security infrastructure including both from the cloud and for the cloud at the core of the fortinet security fabric are our fortigate physical and software licenses which ship with a broad set of security services including firewall vpn antimalware antispam application control intrusion prevention access control web filtering traffic and device segmentation and atp many of these security services are tuned and updated by our fortiguard labs team which provides threat research and a global cloud network of data collection and intelligence resources to deliver subscriptionbased services to fortigate appliances and software products 

enterprise customers select the form and deployment method that best meet their specific security requirements such as a highspeed dcfw at the network core a ngfw at the edge an internal segmentation firewall “isfw” between network zones a distributed enterprise firewall at branch sites or software and hardwarebased solutions designed for virtualized and cloud environments many smaller businesses also tend to deploy utm devices we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances which range from the fortigate20 to 100 series designed for small businesses fortigate200 to 900 series for mediumsized businesses to the fortigate1000 to 7000 series for large enterprises and service providers our network security platform also includes our fortiguard security subscription services which endcustomers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to application control antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality endcustomers may also purchase fortimanager and fortianalyzer products in conjunction with a fortigate deployment to provide enterpriseclass centralized management analysis and reporting capabilities fortisiem provides organizations with a solution for analyzing and managing network security performance and compliance standards across our and other vendors’ products finally endcustomers may purchase forticare technical support services for our products and forticare professional services to assist in the design implementation and maintenance of their networks 

we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software licenses that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise these products include our fortimail email security fortisandbox atp fortiweb web application firewall fortiddos and fortidb database security appliances as well as our forticlient endpoint security software fortiap secure wireless access points and fortiswitch secure switch connectivity products 

 sales of complementary products and software licenses have outpaced our overall growth in recent quarters our strong technology advantages also position us to effectively deliver security to the cloud and for the cloud sales of our cloud related products and services across public private and hybrid cloud environments continue to grow faster than other part of our business

financial highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

revenue grew in 2016 as our strategy of investing in sales and marketing enabled us to continue to gain market share and customers our sales increased in 2016 primarily due to the strength in sales of our enterprise service bundles and the fortinet security fabric we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues on a geographic basis revenue continues to be diversified globally which remains a key strength of our business 

  

the percentage of our fortigate related billings from midrange products increased from 25  in 2015 to 28  in 2016 and the entrylevel products remained at 34  in 2016 consistent with billings in 2015 the percentage of our fortigate related billings from highend products decreased from 41  in 2015 to 38  in 2016 the sale of nonfortigate products also grew significantly such as growth in our fortisandbox atp products we also saw more deals that included multiple fortinet products in physical virtual and cloud environments 

in 2016  operating expenses increased by 1870 million  or 26  as compared to 2015  the increase was primarily driven by our investments made to expand our sales coverage grow our marketing capabilities develop new products and scale our customer support we also continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position we believe that continued product innovation has strengthened our technology and resulted in market share gains in addition we incurred expenses from business design and reengineering related to the implementation of a new erp system headcount increased by 16 to 4665 employees and contractors as of december 31 2016 up from 4018 as of december 31 2015 

business model 

our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products software licenses and services directly to distributors which sell to resellers and service providers which in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to governmentfocused resellers large service providers and major systems integrators which have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements we also offer our products through amazon web services and microsoft azure while the revenue from such sales are still relatively insignificant they are rapidly increasing and are aligned with the networking trends of our customers and the industry as a whole 

typically fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our physical products and software licenses most frequently as part of a bundle offering that includes hardware and services functionality we generally invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and security and technical support services and the invoice is payable within 30 to 90 days we also invoice certain software licenses and services on a monthly basis 

we generally recognize product revenue up front and ratably recognize revenue for the sale of new and the renewal of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts we recognize revenue for certain software licenses up front as product revenue and to a lesser extent recognize other software licenses over the term of the agreement as services revenue we recognize the security and support revenue over the service period which is typically one to three years but can be as long as five years sales of new and renewal services are a source of recurring revenue and increase our deferred revenue balance which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations

we monitor a number of financial and liquidity metrics including the key financial metrics set forth below in order to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies the following table summarizes revenue deferred revenue billings nongaap cash cash equivalents and investments net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow nongaap we discuss revenue below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss our cash cash equivalents and investments and net cash provided by operating activities below under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue billings nongaap and free cash flow nongaap are discussed immediately below the following table 



  

deferred revenue  our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unrecognized portion of service revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts which is recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual service period we monitor our deferred revenue balance growth and the mix of shortterm and longterm deferred revenue because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods deferred revenue was 104 billion  as of december 31 2016  an increase of 2440 million  or 31  from december 31 2015  

billings nongaap we define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with gaap plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations during the period we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive future revenue which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business there are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of gaap revenue first billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue and are impacted by the term of security and support agreements second we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures management accounts for these limitations by providing specific information regarding gaap revenue and evaluating billings together with gaap revenue total billings were 152 billion  for 2016 an increase of 23 compared to 123 billion  in 2015 

a reconciliation of billings to revenue the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided below 



free cash flow nongaap  we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures such as purchases of real estate and other property and equipment we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after capital expenditures can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic 

 40 

acquisitions repurchasing outstanding common stock and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow facilitates management’s comparison of our operating results to those of our peer companies a limitation of using free cash flow rather than the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating liquidity is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash cash equivalents and investments balance for the period because it excludes cash provided by or used for other investing and financing activities management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the cash flow statement and under “—liquidity and capital resources” a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided below 



components of operating results 

revenue 

we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our products software licenses and amortization of amounts included in deferred revenue related to previous sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

  

 

 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 



 41 

costs excess and obsolete inventory costs warranty costs and amortization and impairment of intangible assets if applicable personnel costs include salaries benefits and bonuses as well as stockbased compensation 

 

gross margin  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products any excess inventory writeoffs product costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products software licenses and services service revenue and software licenses have had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher gross margins compared to product gross margins during 2016  product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products as well as inventory management and warehouse efficiencies service gross margins remained relatively comparable in 2016 compared to 2015 we believe our overall gross margin will remain at a relatively comparable level in 2017 

  operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries benefits bonuses stockbased compensation and sales commissions as applicable we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our workforce 

 

 

 

 

interest income  interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in corporate debt securities commercial paper us government and agency securities municipal bonds money market funds and certificates of deposit 

other expense — net  other expense—net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses relate to foreign currency exchange remeasurement 

provision for income taxes  we are subject to tax in the us as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than us tax rates and may be subject to us income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the us research and development tax credits withholding taxes and nondeductible stockbased compensation expense 

 42 

the income tax provision for 2016  was comprised of domestic income taxes foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes our effective tax rate approximates the us federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense research and development tax credits foreign withholding tax nondeductible stockbased compensation expense and foreign income subject to lower tax rates than income earned in the us 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of the significant accounting policies described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our hardware software fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services and other services through our channel partners and a direct sales force 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

  

   

   

 

 

we recognize product revenue for sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to endcustomers upon shipment based on general revenue recognition accounting guidance once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met certain distributors are granted stock rotation rights limited rights of return and rebates for sales of our products the arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not typically fixed or determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sellthrough for sales that include endcustomer acceptance criteria revenue is recognized upon acceptance we recognize software license revenue upon delivery historically software license revenue has not been material 

substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services which consist of security subscriptions and technical support services security services provide access to our antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades maintenance releases and patches telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 

service revenue consists of sales from our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services professional and training services and other services that include software as a service “saas” and infrastructure as a service “iaas” both of which are hosted or cloudbased services we recognize revenue from these arrangements as the subscription service is delivered over the term which is typically one year or on a monthly usage basis to date saas and iaas revenues have not represented a significant percentage of our total revenue 

 43 

we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances and   record reductions to revenue for rebates and estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs additionally in limited circumstances we may permit endcustomers distributors and resellers to return our products subject to varying limitations for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience 

our sales arrangements typically contain multiple elements such as hardware security subscription technical support services and other services the majority of our hardware appliance products contain our operating system software that together function to deliver the essential functionality of the product our products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price using vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if it exists or thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable we use our best estimate of selling price “besp” for that deliverable revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 

  

for our hardware appliances we use besp as our selling price estimate for our support and other services we generally use vsoe as our selling price estimate we determine vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement based on the historical pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately in establishing vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical standalone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe for our support and other services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple historical factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels that fall within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price 

for multipleelement arrangements where software deliverables are included revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the estimated selling price hierarchy the amount allocated to the software deliverables is then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when vsoe of fair value exists if evidence of vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all software allocated revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period the same residual method and vsoe of fair value principles apply for our multiple element arrangements that contain only software elements 

we currently are evaluating the impact of the new standard related to revenue recognition and we may incur significant costs to adopt and to comply with this new pronouncement see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

stockbased compensation 

employee stock options  we estimate the fair value of employee stock options awarded to our employees using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model for all employee stock options we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method our option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term riskfree interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock the assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment   a 10 change in any of these assumptions would not have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

employee stock purchase plan  we estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” using the blackscholes pricing model and we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method the pricing model requires the input of the fair value of our common stock and assumptions including the expected term of the award expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock our espp provides for consecutive sixmonth offering periods and we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of espp shares a 10 change in any of these assumptions would not have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

 44 

valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record additional inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

business combinations 

we include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill we often continue to gather additional information throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded such charges are recorded in the period in which they are identified 

restructuring 

our restructuring expenses consist of severance and other onetime benefits contract terminations and other expenses liabilities for costs associated with a restructuring activity are measured at fair value onetime termination benefits are expensed at the date we notify the employee unless the employee must provide future service in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period a liability for terminating a contract before the end of its term which termination is usually done by giving written notice to the counterparty within the notification period specified by the contract or by otherwise negotiating a termination with the counterparty is recognized at fair value on the notification date a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity is recognized at the ceaseuse date other costs primarily consist of asset writeoffs which are expensed when incurred 

we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plan actual results may differ and thereby require us to record an additional provision or reverse a portion of such a provision 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in addition deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of the position that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may 

 45 

exist any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted 

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 



 46 



2016  and 2015   

revenue 



total revenue increased by 2662 million  or 26  in 2016  compared to 2015  we continued to experience global diversification of revenue in 2016 revenue from all our regions grew with emea contributing the largest portion of our revenue growth both on an absolute dollar and on a percentage basis product revenue increased by 713 million  or 15  in 

 47 

2016 compared to 2015  the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family across all product categories and in particular for our highend and midrange products for large enterprise customers sales of nonfortigate products such as fortisandbox also grew significantly service revenue increased by 1948 million  or 37  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in service revenue was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues t o highermargin recurring service revenues which reflect our ongoing success in driving sales of lowend and highend service bundles 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



total gross margin increased by 19  percentage points in 2016  compared to 2015  as both product and service gross margins increased product gross margin increased by 18  percentage points in 2016  compared to 2015  product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as certain of our virtualized security solutions and by lower warranty related costs and was partially offset by higher inventory reserves 

service gross margin increased during 2016 as compared to 2015 as we scaled efficiencies resulting from an increased mix on highermargin service revenue cost of service revenue increased by 325 million  and was comprised primarily of personnel costs 

operating expenses 

  



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 250 million  or 16  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to an increase of 190 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products depreciation and other occupancyrelated costs increased by 66 million we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization but expect research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue to remain at a relatively comparable level in 2017 

 48 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 1561 million  or 33  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to an increase of 1223 million in personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales and marketing headcount in order to drive continued market share gains globally in addition depreciation expense and other occupancyrelated expense increased by 140 million and travel and entertainment expense increased by 81 million marketingrelated expense increased by 76   million as we invested significantly in marketing programs to capture market share particularly in the large enterprise market including costs related to trade shows and lead generation as a percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expense increased as we accelerated the investment in our sales force and marketing programs to drive future growth we intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure and marketing strategy which are critical to support growth but expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue to decline in 2017 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 96 million  or 13  in 2016  compared to 2015  personnel costs increased by 96 million as we continued to increase headcount in order to support our expanding business and erp implementation during 2016 we expensed 78 million of thirdparty costs relating to the implementation and maintenance of the erp system implementation compared to 54 million in 2015 these increases were partially offset by lower professional fees of 67 million in 2016 as a percentage of total revenue we expect general and administrative expense to increase compared to 2016 as we continue to expand our erp capabilities and implement the new revenue recognition standard 

  

restructuring 

restructuring expenses of 40 million  in 2016 primarily relate to our restructuring activities to improve operating efficiencies due to the acquisition of accelops and certain other activities restructuring charges of 76 million  during 2015 relate to restructuring activities in connection with the meru acquisition see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details including the types of expenses incurred and cash payments made see also the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

interest income and other expense — net 

  



interest income increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to interest earned on invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments interest income varies depending on our average investment balances during the period types and mix of investments and market interest rates the increase in other expense—net in 2016 as compared to 2015 was the result of higher foreign currency exchange losses 

provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 25  for 2016  compared with an effective tax rate of 53  for 2015  the provision for income taxes for 2016  was comprised primarily of us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes an increase in tax reserves as well as transfer pricing allocations that impact jurisdictional income taxed at various tax rates the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits for income tax provision from the adoption of asu 201609 in 2016 due to the early adoption of asu 201609 approximately 108 million 

 49 

of excess tax benefits were recognized in the income tax provision in 2015 there were no excess tax benefits included in the income tax provision 

it is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2016 we had accrued 95 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of 55 million as of december 31 2015 

within the next twelve months we do not believe there will be a decrease in uncertain tax benefits that could significantly impact our effective tax rate 

2015  and 2014   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased by 2389 million or 31 in 2015 compared to 2014 total revenue in 2015 of 101 billion included meru’s revenue from july 8 2015 to december 31 2015 of 281 million or 3 of total revenue excluding meru’s revenue our revenue was 9812 million an increase of 27 compared to the same period last year we continued to experience global diversification of revenue in 2015 the americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on an absolute dollar basis and all three regions showed growth on a percentage basis product revenue increased by 1162 million or 32 in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family across all product categories particularly in our highend products for large enterprise customers service revenue increased by 1227 million or 30 in 2015 compared to 2014 the increase in service revenue was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods 

 50 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



  

total gross margin increased by 16 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 as both product and service gross margins increased product gross margin increased by 21 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a greater mix of highend fortigate product sales compared to the same period last year such as our fortigate5000 series in addition product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as certain of our virtualized security solutions as well as by inventory management efficiencies 

service gross margin increased during 2015 as compared to 2014 as we scaled efficiencies resulting from our ability to charge more for our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support offerings cost of service revenue increased by 167 million primarily due to an 116 million increase in personnel costs related to headcount increases 

  

operating expenses 

  



 not meaningful 

research and development 

research and development expense increased by 352 million or 29 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase of 258 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products depreciation and other occupancyrelated costs increased by 36 million in addition during 2014 we had a reversal of 30 million related to a previously recorded liability for estimated contingent consideration 

  

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 1546 million or 49 in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase of 1080 million in personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales and marketing headcount marketingrelated expenses increased by 169 million as we invested significantly in marketing investments to drive broader market awareness create a global marketing engine build broad market lead generation and nurture programs and accelerate pipeline in addition we incurred increases in travel expenses of 91 million and depreciation and occupancyrelated costs of 93 million as a 

 51 

percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expense increased as we accelerated the investment in our sales force and marketing programs to drive future growth 

  

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 302 million or 73 in 2015 compared to 2014 personnel costs increased by 146 million as we continued to increase headcount in order to support our expanding business in addition professional fees increased by 69 million primarily due to legal services related to the assertion of our intellectual property and other rights in 2015 we also incurred 54 million in third party expenses related to business process design and reengineering in preparation of an erp system implementation and 17 million of costs related to the meru acquisition 

restructuring 

restructuring expenses of 76 million in 2015 primarily relate to the restructuring activities in connection with the meru acquisition to reduce our cost structure and improve operational efficiencies see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details including types of expenses incurred and the timing of future expenses and cash payments see also the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

interest income and other expense — net 

  



interest income and other expense—net remained relatively consistent in 2015 compared to 2014 interest income varies depending on our average investment balances during the period types and mix of investments and market interest rates other expense—net consisted primarily of foreign exchange losses 

provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 53 for 2015 compared with an effective tax rate of 59 for 2014 the provision for income taxes for 2015 was comprised primarily of us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes and an increase in tax reserves as well as the inclusion of stockbased compensation benefits and transfer pricing allocations which impacted jurisdictional income taxed at various tax rates the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2015 was primarily due to higher research and development credits additional tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense and lower foreign withholding taxes 

it is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2015 we had accrued 55 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of 17 million as of december 31 2014 

 52 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period 



 

 53 

 



 

 



 

 

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend which has positively impacted billings and product revenue activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential customer buying which results in lower billings and product revenue although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has generally increased sequentially in each quarter except in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015 product revenue on average throughout the year increased in 2016  as compared to the same quarters in 2015  which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales and marketing organizations to a robust security market and to continued product innovation we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues which reflect our ongoing success in driving sales of lowend and highend service bundles 

  

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services and between products product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products in addition product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as certain of our virtualized security solutions as well as inventory management efficiencies service gross margins on average throughout the year increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a mix shift to highermargin service revenue as well as scaled efficiencies 

 54 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as by our business acquisitions real estate and other capital expenditures stock repurchases proceeds associated with stock option exercises and issuances of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan payment of taxes in connection with the net settlement of equity awards and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or may make in the future our previous stock repurchase program the “2015 repurchase program” expired on december 31 2015 with an unused balance under the 2015 repurchase program of 625 million in january 2016 our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program which authorizes the repurchase of up to 2000 million of our outstanding common stock through december 31 2017 in october 2016 our board of directors authorized the purchase of additional 1000 million of shares of our common stock under the 2016 repurchase program increasing our current authorization to 3000 million through december 31 2017 in recent years we have received significant capital resources as a result of the exercise of stock options we expect proceeds in future years to be impacted by the increased mix of restricted stock units “rsu” granted versus stock options and also to vary based on our share price we expect to spend 1400 million to 1500 million in capital expenditures primarily related to purchase of real estate to expand our offices to support worldwide growth 

as of december 31 2016  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 131 billion  were invested primarily in corporate debt securities commercial paper us government and agency securities municipal bonds money market funds certificates of deposit and term deposits it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital provides liquidity and maximizes return without significantly increasing risk 

as of december 31 2016  5048 million  of our cash and investments were held by our international subsidiaries and are therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated while we do not intend to do so should this amount be repatriated most of it would be subject to us federal income tax that would be partially offset by foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of 2016 we repatriated 550 million of cash from offshore a decision was made to bring this cash back to the us as it carried a substantial foreign tax credit amounting to 223 million we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity the continuing market acceptance of our products and our investments in real estate through purchases or longterm leases we anticipate our capital expenditures spending in 2017 to be approximately 1400 million to 1500 million such capital expenditures include purchases completed in january 2017 purchases currently in escrow and purchases signed but not yet in escrow totaling 27 million 880 million and 130 million respectively historically we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisition activities in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

 55 

operating activities 

cash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity it is primarily comprised of net income as adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash adjustments consist primarily of stockbased compensation depreciation of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets and amortization of investment premiums 

  

 our operating activities during 2016 provided 3457 million  in cash as a result of our continued growth of our business and the ability to successfully manage our working capital changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in sales of our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical supports to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in our deferred revenue which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and payments for inventory purchases we are also starting to see a shift from product revenues to highermargin recurring service revenues for example our total revenue grew 26 in 2016 compared to 2015 while our total deferred revenue balance grew 31 

our operating activities during 2015 provided 2825 million in cash as a result of our continued growth in billings and the ability to successfully manage our working capital additionally in 2015 we received 90 million related to a mutual threeyear covenantnottosue agreement changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in payments received from customers partially offset by an increase in payments to vendors 

our operating activities during 2014 provided 1966 million in cash as a result of profitability timing of billings and collections and the ability to successfully manage our working capital the primary sources of cash from operating activities during 2014 consisted of net income of 253 million increased by noncash adjustments of 939 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 774 million in 2014 we received 200 million pursuant to a sixyear mutual covenantnottosue and release agreement with palo alto networks changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase in payments received from customers and a receipt of cash related to the mutual covenantnottosue and release agreement partially offset by payments for inventory purchases prepayment of certain expenses and payments of income taxes during the period 

investing activities 

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments purchases of property and equipment and payments made in connection with business acquisitions historically in making a lease versus purchase decision related to our larger facilities we have elected to purchase the facility we expect to make similar decisions in the future 

during 2016 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the 672 million  we spent on capital expenditures including our purchases of a warehouse in union city california for total cash of 185 million and a 221 million  payment for the acquisition of accelops the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities net of purchases from our investments of 151 million  

during 2015 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 380 million used for the acquisition of meru in addition we spent 374 million on capital expenditures including our purchases of certain real properties in sunnyvale california and sophia france for total cash of 139 million the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities net of purchases from our investments of 744 million 

during 2014 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 322 million spent on capital expenditures partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities net of purchases from our investments of 29 million 

financing activities 

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan and espp taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation and repurchase and retirement of common stock 

during 2016 cash used for financing activities was 1059 million  primarily due to 1108 million  used to repurchase our common stock this was partially offset by 66 million  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of tax withholding 

 56 

during 2015 cash used for financing activities was 216 million primarily due to 600 million used to repurchase our common stock this was partially offset by 384 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of tax withholding 

during 2014 cash provided by financing activities was 07 million as a result of proceeds of 553 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans this cash inflow was partially offset by 440 million used to repurchase our common stock and 106 million of taxes payment related to withholding 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  

  



 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during 2016  2015  and 2014  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities including corporate debt securities money market funds commercial paper municipal bonds us government and agency securities and certificates of deposit and term deposits the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2016  2015  and 2014  would have resulted in an insignificant decrease in our interest income in each of these periods 

 57 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the us are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar “cad” the euro “eur” the british pound “gbp” and the chinese yen “cny” to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to minimize the impact of balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the credit worthiness of these parties these contracts typically have a maturity of one month we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts as other expense in the consolidated statement of operations we recognized an expense of 66 million  in other expense—net in 2016  due to foreign currency transaction losses 

our use of forward exchange contracts is intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements are relatively shortterm in nature and are focused on the cad longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar against other foreign currencies such as the eur gbp and cny could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 58 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash balances as of december 31 2016 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

seasonality 

for information regarding seasonality in our sales see the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—quarterly results of operations—seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

• our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and technological expertise 

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

• brand recognition 

• customer service and support 

• sales and distribution capabilities 

• size and financial stability of operations and 

• breadth of product line 

among others our competitors include bluecoat systems inc “bluecoat” check point software technologies ltd “check point” cisco systems inc “cisco” through its acquisition of sourcefire inc “sourcefire” dell inc through its acquisition of sonicwall inc “sonicwall” f5 networks inc “f5 networks” fireeye inc “fireeye” intel through its acquisition of mcafee inc “mcafee” juniper networks inc “juniper” palo alto networks inc “palo alto networks” and sophos group plc “sophos” 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance reliability and breadth our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and 

 6 

leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance market their products better or achieve greater market acceptance than us in addition our larger competitors often have broader product lines and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  our total headcount was 4018  employees and contractors none of our us employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in certain european countries have the right to be represented by external labor organizations if they maintain uptodate union membership we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially and investors may lose some or all of their investment 

risks related to our business   

our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control or may be difficult to predict including 

  

   

   

 

   

 

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

  8 

  

   

   

   

 

 

 

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global economic conditions weak economic conditions in certain geographies or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our channel partners reduced unit sales and slower or declining growth 

our billings and revenue growth may slow or may not continue 

  

 billings and revenue growth may slow or we may experience a decrease in billings and revenue for a number of reasons including a slowdown in demand for our products or services increased competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market softness in demand in certain geographies or industry verticals such as the service provider industry if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities and due to other risks identified in the “risk factors” our 

 9 

expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expected and if our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings and revenue growth and we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue do not appropriately manage our cost structure or encounter unanticipated liabilities any failure by us to maintain profitability and continue our billings and revenue growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

we rely significantly on revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services which may decline and because we recognize revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in purchases of fortigate appliances endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers’ spending levels if our sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business could suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact our billings and revenue furthermore we recognize fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically from one to three years and in some instances has been as long as five years as a result much of the fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services is not reflected in full in our statements of operations until future periods our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

  

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

 10 

 

 

 

 

   

 

   

product and service sales and employee and contractor matters may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change over time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in litigation regulatory action costs of investigation delays in revenue recognition delays in financial reporting financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large and mediumsized enterprises service providers and government organizations while we have increased sales in recent periods to large enterprises and service providers we have experienced less traction selling to certain government organizations and there can be no assurance that we will be successful selling to these customers sales to these organizations involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller entities these risks include 

  

   

 

   

 

   

large and mediumsized enterprises service providers and government organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases over 12 months although we have a channel sales model 

 11 

our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with endcustomers along with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to large and mediumsized endcustomers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales in addition product purchases by large and mediumsized enterprises service providers and government organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays furthermore service providers represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business large and mediumsized enterprises service providers and government organizations typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability expect a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers in addition if sales expected from a large and mediumsized endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders or not place orders commensurate with our expectations if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture or ship certain products increases for any reason inventory shortfalls could result management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell 

  

in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have in the past experienced inventory shortages due to more demand for certain products than we had forecasted if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder chairman and chief executive officer and michael xie our cofounder president and chief technology officer and any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives the loss of the services or distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering and sales may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we experience turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highlyskilled personnel is frequently intense especially for qualified employees in network security and especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel such as the san francisco bay area and vancouver canada we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or 

 12 

divulged proprietary or other confidential information 

the average sales prices of our products may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the average sales prices for our products may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts or promotional programs we offer a change in our mix of products and anticipation of the introduction of new products competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or may bundle them with other products additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions have in the past and may in the future negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the average sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles we cannot ensure that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter for example on average over the past eight quarters our shipments during the last two weeks of each quarter accounted for 31 of aggregate billings for each quarter if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our logistics partners’ inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing any delays in shipments due to trade compliance requirements labor disputes or logistics changes at shipping ports or otherwise our billings and revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products and to improve lead generation and sales enablement our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large enterprise service provider and government organization market we have historically had relatively low spending on marketing activities while we have increased our investments in sales and marketing it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased revenue if our investments in additional sales personnel or if our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market awareness of our company and products and increased lead generation we will not be able to achieve sustained growth and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

  

substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners which include distributors and resellers we depend upon our channel partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products and incentivize them to sell our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services and may purchase more inventory than they can sell our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions in addition if our channel partners’ financial condition or operations weaken it could negatively impact their ability to sell our product and services they may also 

 13 

market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products they may also have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot ensure that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results during 2015 2014 and 2013 exclusive networks group which distributed our solutions to a large group of resellers and endcustomers accounted for 18  15  and 12  of our total revenue respectively in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach or misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

  

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks different customers deploy and use our products in different ways and certain deployments and usages may subject our products to adverse conditions that may negatively impact the effectiveness and useful lifetime of our products we cannot ensure that our products will prevent all security threats because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard security subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard security subscription services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortigate appliances and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of our customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products and services and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized thirdparty any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in

our business and operations have experienced growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

our business has grown over the last several years we rely heavily on information technology and accounting systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews certain of these systems were developed by us for our internal use and as such may have a higher risk of failure or not receive the same level of support as systems purchased from and supported by external technology companies in addition we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on the manual processing of emails internally and receipt   of customer purchase orders through email and to a lesser extent through electronic data interchange   from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a majority of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter a significant interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased billings and revenue for that quarter to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial operating and administrative systems and controls and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems controls and processes such as system access and change management controls in a timely or efficient manner our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner whether as a result of the significant growth of our business or otherwise may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses moreover the failure of our systems and processes could undermine our ability to provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results and could impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our productivity and the quality of our products and services may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations 

  

we may experience difficulties implementing and maintaining our new enterprise resource planning system 

  

we purchased a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system and are currently implementing the new system erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming and involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities the erp system will be critical to our ability to provide important information to our management obtain and deliver products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations accurately maintain books and records provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results   or otherwise operate our business erp implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system any such transformation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations the implementation and maintenance of the new erp system has required and will continue to require the investment of significant financial and human resources and the implementation may be subject to delays and cost overruns in addition we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation of the new erp system without experiencing difficulties any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation or the ongoing maintenance of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations accurately maintain books and records provide accurate timely and reliable reports on our financial and operating results or otherwise operate our business additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or the system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

 15 

significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition and sales return reserves stockbased compensation expense valuation of inventory warranty liabilities investments accounting for business combination goodwill and other longlived assets restructuring accounting for income taxes and litigation and settlement costs 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners including faraday kmicro and renesas our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers in asia and elsewhere reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance and product costs supply and timing any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production or shipping interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages quality problems or strike or other labor disruption at one of our manufacturing partners or locations or at shipping ports or locations would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary fortiasic which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and tsmc on a purchase order basis and umc and tsmc do not guarantee any capacity and could reject orders or could try to increase pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary or long term inventory shortages of our fortiasic as well as increased costs our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes or more profitable products if any of these manufacturers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics our business would be harmed 

  

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the european union’s “eu” restriction of hazardous substances directive “rohs” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals” that are contained in our products have originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a 

 16 

specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage or loss of sales and customers or increase component costs resulting in lower gross margins 

  

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of central processing units from intel network chips from broadcom corporation marvell technology group ltd and intel and hard drives from western digital technologies inc the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar while we are not currently engaged in material hedging activities we 

 17 

have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts and if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currencydenominated operating expenses in addition a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or restrictions on sales and could impair our ability to compete in international markets 

  

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the united states only with the required export license or through an export license exception and may be prohibited altogether from export to certain countries if we were to fail to comply with us export laws us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits for example for stocking orders placed by our partners we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

  

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

  

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the near future if this exemption is revoked if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

 18 

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

  

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to government organizations sales to government organizations are subject to a number of risks selling to government organizations can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense with long sales cycles and without any assurance of winning a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

 

 

 

 

the rules and regulations applicable to sales to government organizations may also negatively impact sales to other organizations to date we have had limited traction in sales to us federal government agencies and any future sales to government organizations is uncertain government organizations may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such government organization the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

  

false detection of vulnerabilities viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

  

our antivirus and our intrusion prevention services may falsely detect viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our antispam and antimalware services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures in addition our threat researchers 

 19 

periodically identify vulnerabilities in various thirdparty products and if these identifications are perceived to be incorrect or are in fact incorrect this could harm our business any such false identification or perceived false identification of important files applications or vulnerabilities could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

if our internal network system or our website is compromised public perception of our products and services will be harmed we may become subject to liability and our business operating results and stock price may be adversely impacted 

we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective network security protection despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches of our internal network system and website we are still vulnerable to computer viruses breakins phishing attacks attempts to overload our servers with denialofservice and other cyberattacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our internal network system or our website our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance or otherwise and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to disclose information in order to gain access to our network we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to protect our network and website will provide absolute security moreover because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers although we have not yet experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network or website an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems or website could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services and investor confidence in our company any breach of our network system or website could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to our endcustomers lead to interruptions or system slowdowns cause loss of critical data or lead to the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential proprietary or sensitive information we could also be subject to liability and litigation and reputational harm and our channel partners and endcustomers may be harmed lose confidence in us and decrease or cease using our products and services any breach of our internal network system or our website could have an adverse effect on our business operating results and stock price 

  

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

  

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products if we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many large endcustomers service provider and government organization endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers because of their more complex deployments if we fail to meet the requirements of our larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with large enterprises service providers and government organizations as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of our subsidiaries are organized our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

  

 

   

   

   

 

 20 

   

   

   

 

   

   

significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the financial accounting standards board standard in addition the standard applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain foreign countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

although we currently do not have a valuation allowance we may in the future be required to establish one we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

in addition we hold a significant portion of our cash and investments outside of the united states potential legislation could result in our transferring this cash and investments back to the united states and potentially incurring an additional tax obligation 

  

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

  

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates in a given jurisdiction differs from our estimate our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations 

  

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

  

 21 

in addition we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities if tax authorities challenge the relative mix of us and international income our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

  

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products or technologies and intellectual property such as patents for example we recently closed our acquisition of meru for any past acquisition or possible future acquisition we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines integrating reporting systems and procedures and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies for example we may experience difficulties integrating meru’s erp system or sales and support processes and systems with our current erp system or our sales and support processes and systems our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete including our acquisition of meru may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property could significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

  

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we generally have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries and in some circumstances we may be required to indemnify a customer in full without a limitation on liability for certain liabilities including potential liabilities that are not contractually limited the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not cover such claim at all or may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

  

 22 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest labor disruption and terrorism 

  

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire power outage flood or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity and our research and development and data office center in vancouver canada is subject to the risk of flooding in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products on a timely basis and assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in our missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability civil unrest labor disruptions acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or of the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at the end of each quarter any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of customer orders or in the delay of the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

  

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

  

our url database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’  expectations 

  

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our 

 23 

determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations could impair the growth of our business 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

  

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

demand for our products may be limited by market perception that individual products from one vendor that provide multiple layers of security protection in one product are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of most of our products depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality in one appliance if the market for these products fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view “allinone” network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that such products of ours provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform our solutions create a 

 24 

“single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of our product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that “allinone” solutions may be suitable only for small and mediumsized businesses because such solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large enterprise service provider and government organization endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with our market in general demand for multisecurity functionality products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include companies such as blue coat check point ciscosourcefire dellsonicwall f5 networks fireeye intelmcafee juniper palo alto networks and sophos 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources such as cisco’s acquisition of sourcefire juniper’s acquisition of netscreen technologies inc intel’s acquisition of mcafee check point’s acquisition of nokia corporations’ security appliance business and dell’s acquisition of sonicwall and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions as a result of such acquisitions competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with 

 25 

our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco f5 networks and juniper offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from time to time legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products

and the mozilla public license from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which requirements could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties are currently asserting have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they may also assert such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a thirdparty even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies nonpracticing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes as well as general commercial litigation and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion 

we have several ongoing patent lawsuits and several nonpracticing entity patent holding companies have sent us letters proposing that we license certain of their patents given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 27 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these requirements as well as proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly although our most recent assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2015 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2016 or future periods we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

  

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

  

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition which are effective for us beginning on january 1 2018 the increased use of fair value measure and financial instruments could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which would have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our reporting obligations 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price could decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report news about fortinet and our financial results news about our competitors and their results and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us or announcements regarding any stock repurchase programs and the timing and amount of shares we purchase under such programs for example over the past twelve months through the filing of this report the closing price of our common stock ranged from 2383 to 4883 

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic 

 28 

political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

business overview 

we provide high performance cybersecurity solutions to a wide variety of enterprises service providers and government organizations of all sizes across the globe including a majority of the 2015 fortune 100 our cybersecurity 

 34 

solutions are fast secure and designed to provide broad rapid protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the it infrastructure of our endcustomers worldwide 

our core product platform is the fortigate physical and virtual appliance which ships with a set of broad security services including firewall vpn application control intrusion prevention web filtering and advanced threat protection “atp” these security services are enabled by fortiguard which provides extensive threat research and a global cloud network to deliver protection services to each fortigate appliance fortigate also has extensive networking capability such as switching routing native internet protocol version 6 and different modes of deployment fortimanager provides central management and fortianalyzer provides reporting and analytics the fortigate platform can be extended to provide enhanced capabilities for example it can be used as a wireless controller for access points an external sandbox can also be attached for local atp analysis 

customers select the functions or combination of functions that best meet their specific security requirements such as a highspeed dcfw at the network core a ngfw at the edge or a broad utm solution at branch sites we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances which range from the fortigate20 to 100 series designed for small businesses fortigate200 to 900 series for midsized enterprises to the fortigate1000 to 5000 series for large enterprises and service providers our network security platform also includes our fortiguard security subscription services to which endcustomers can subscribe in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to application control antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality endcustomers can also choose to purchase forticare technical support services for our products endcustomers also often use fortimanager and fortianalyzer products in conjunction with a fortigate deployment to provide centralized management and analysis and reporting capabilities 

we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software licenses that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise such as our secure wireless and access technologies advanced threat protection secure email gateway web application firewalls application delivery controllers databases security product ddos security product and endpoint security product for employee computers and mobile devices sales of these complementary products have grown in recent quarters 

financial highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revenue grew in 2015 as our integrated security platform products put us in a strong competitive position in a robust security market we continue to strengthen partnerships with enterprise resellers and gain from our prior sales investments in addition we continue to execute our strategy of selling to enterprise customers and landing large deals with some of these customers enterprise customers have vast infrastructures and we believe this will provide expansion opportunities for us in the future our strategy has enabled us to gain market share win new customers and expand within existing customer accounts especially in the large enterprise market which is key to our longterm growth and profitability strategy large enterprises represent significant opportunity for crosssell and upsell as they tend to purchase more products and services over time 

 35 

yielding substantial lifetime value aside from obtaining new customers other levers to drive longterm growth and operating leverage include adding more functionality and value in our security subscription and support service offerings to customers 

in 2015 sales of highend fortigate products fortigate1000 to 5000 series increased due to enterprise adoption of our highend appliances such as the fortigate1500d 3700d and 5000 series the percentage of our fortigate related billings from highend products increased from 38  in 2014 to 41  in 2015 while the midrange products decreased from 26  in 2014 to 25  in 2015 and the entrylevel products decreased from 36  in 2014 to 34  in 2015 

in 2015  operating expenses increased by 2276 million  or 47  as compared to 2014  the increase was primarily driven by our accelerated pace of hiring and continued investments to expand our sales coverage grow our marketing capabilities develop new products and scale our customer support we also continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position we believe that continued product innovation has strengthened our technology and resulted in market share gains in addition we incurred costs from the integration of meru and the implementation of restructuring activities and expenses related to business design and reengineering in preparation of an erp system implementation headcount increased by 41 to 4018 employees and contractors as of december 31 2015 up from 2854 as of december 31 2014 

business model 

our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors which sell to resellers and service providers which in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to governmentfocused resellers large service providers and major systems integrators which have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements typically fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our physical and virtual appliances most frequently as part of a bundle offering that includes hardware and services we invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and technical support services and the invoice generally becomes payable within 30 to 90 days we generally recognize product revenue upfront and defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts we recognize the related service revenue over the service period which is typically one to three years although it can be as long as five years sales of new and renewal services are a source of recurring revenue and increase our deferred revenue balance which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations 

key metrics 

we monitor a number of financial and operating metrics including the key financial metrics set forth below in order to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies the following table summarizes revenue deferred revenue billings nongaap cash cash equivalents and investments net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow nongaap we discuss revenue below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss our cash cash equivalents and investments and net cash provided by operating activities below under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue billings nongaap and free cash flow nongaap are discussed immediately below the following table 



  

deferred revenue  our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue deferred revenue is amortized as revenue ratably over the contractual service period the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unrecognized portion of service revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support service contracts we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant 

 36 

portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods total deferred revenue as of december 31 2015 increased by 2325 million  or 42 compared to a year ago total deferred revenue as of december 31 2015 of 7913 million  included deferred revenue relating to meru of 145 million or 2 of total deferred revenue excluding meru’s deferred revenue our deferred revenue as of december 31 2015 was 7768 million an increase of 2180 million or 39 compared to a year ago 

billings nongaap we define billings as revenue recognized in accordance with gaap plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations during the period we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drives deferred revenue which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business there are a number of limitations related to the use of billings instead of gaap revenue first billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue second we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding gaap revenue and evaluating billings together with gaap revenue 

total billings for the year ended december 31 2015 increased by 3355 million or 37 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 total billings for the year ended december 31 2015 of 123 billion  included meru’s billings from july 8 2015 to december 31 2015 of 328 million  or 3 of total billings excluding meru our billings for the year ended december 31 2015 were 120 billion an increase of 34 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 

a reconciliation of billings to revenue the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided below 

reconciliation of total consolidated gaap revenue to billings 



reconciliation of meru ’ s gaap revenue to billings 



free cash flow nongaap  we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures such as purchases of property and equipment we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions repurchasing outstanding common stock and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow facilitates management’s comparison of our operating results to those of our peer companies a limitation of using free cash flow rather than the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating liquidity is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash cash equivalents and investments balance for the period because it excludes cash provided by or used for other investing and financing activities management accounts for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the cash flow statement and under “—liquidity and capital resources” a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating

activities the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided below 



components of operating results 

revenue 

we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our products and amortization of amounts included in deferred revenue related to previous sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

  

 

 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

 

 

gross margin  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products any excess inventory writeoffs product costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services in 2015 service revenue had a positive effect on our total 

 38 

gross margin given the higher service gross margins compared to product gross margins during 2015  service gross margins increased compared to 2014 we believe our overall gross margin will remain at a relatively comparable level in 2016 

  operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries benefits bonuses stockbased compensation and sales commissions as applicable we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our workforce 

 

 

 

 

interest income  interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities municipal bonds certificates of deposit and term deposits and us government and agency securities 

other expense net  other expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange and related hedging gains and losses foreign exchange gains and losses relate to foreign currency exchange remeasurement the hedging gains and losses are related to our settled balance sheet hedges 

provision for income taxes  we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than us tax rates and may be subject to us income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the us research and development tax credits withholding taxes nondeductible stockbased compensation expense and adjustments related to our intercompany transfer pricing 

the income tax provision for 2015  was comprised of domestic income taxes foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes our effective tax rate approximates the us federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes research and development tax credits foreign withholding tax nondeductible stockbased compensation expense and foreign income subject to lower tax rates than income earned in the united states 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue and expenses and related disclosures we base 

 39 

our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of the significant accounting policies described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our hardware software fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services and other services through our channel partners and a direct sales force 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

  

   

   

 

 

we recognize product revenue for sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to endcustomers upon shipment based on general revenue recognition accounting guidance once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met certain distributors are granted stock rotation rights limited rights of return and rebates for sales of our products the arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not typically fixed or determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sellthrough for sales that include endcustomer acceptance criteria revenue is recognized upon acceptance 

substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services which consist of security subscriptions and technical support services security services provide access to our antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades maintenance releases and patches telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support we recognize revenue from these services ratably over the contractual service period revenue related to subsequent renewals of these services is recognized over the term of the renewal agreement 

we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances and   record reductions to revenue for rebates and estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs additionally in limited circumstances we may permit endcustomers distributors and resellers to return our products subject to varying limitations for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience 

our sales arrangements typically contain multiple elements such as hardware security subscription technical support services and other services the majority of our hardware appliance products contain our operating system software that together function to deliver the essential functionality of the product our products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price using vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if it exists or thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable we use our best estimate of selling price “besp” for that deliverable revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 

  

 40 

for our hardware appliances we use besp as our selling price estimate for our support and other services we generally use vsoe as our selling price estimate we determine vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement based on the historical pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately in establishing vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical standalone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe for our support and other services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple historical factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels that fall within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price 

for multipleelement arrangements where software deliverables are included revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the estimated selling price hierarchy the amount allocated to the software deliverables is then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when vsoe of fair value exists if evidence of vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all software allocated revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period the same residual method and vsoe of fair value principles apply for our multiple element arrangements that contain only software elements 

stockbased compensation 

employee stock options   we estimate the fair value of employee stock options awarded to our employees using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model for all employee stock options we recognize expense net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period using the straightline method our option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term riskfree interest rates expected dividend yield of our common stock and forfeiture rate the assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment   a 10 change in any of these assumptions would not have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

employee stock purchase plan  we estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” using the blackscholes pricing model and we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method the pricing model requires the input of the fair value of our common stock and subjective assumptions including the expected term of the award the expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock our espp provides for consecutive sixmonth offering periods and we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of espp shares a 10 change in any of these assumptions would not have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

restricted stock units  we account for the fair value of restricted stock units “rsus” awarded to employees and members of our board of directors using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant rsus are payable in shares of our common stock as the periodic vesting requirements are satisfied rsus generally vest over a fouryear period if the employees contractors or directors as applicable remain with us for the duration of the vesting period for all rsus we recognize expense net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period using the straightline method 

performance stock units we grant performance stock units “psus” to certain of our executive officers rsus granted to executive officers contain both servicebased and marketbased vesting conditions psus vest over a specified service period upon the satisfaction of certain marketbased vesting conditions and settle into shares of our common stock upon vesting over a two or threeyear period the fair value of a psu is calculated using the monte carlo simulation model on the date of grant and is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant modified to reflect the impact of the marketbased vesting condition including the estimated payout level based on that condition we do not adjust compensation cost for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the marketbased vesting conditions 

valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record 

 41 

additional inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

business combinations 

we include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our business acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill additional information existing as of the acquisition date but unknown to us at that time may become known during the remainder of the measurement period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date which may result in changes to the amounts and allocations recorded 

restructuring charges 

we recognize liability for exit and disposal activities when the liability is incurred our restructuring charges consist of severance and other onetime benefits contract terminations and other charges liabilities for costs associated with a restructuring activity are measured at fair value and are recognized when the liability is incurred onetime termination benefits are expensed at the date we notify the employee unless the employee must provide future service in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period a liability for contracttermination costs represents a liability for costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term and is recognized at fair value when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms which is usually done by giving written notice to the counterparty within the notification period specified by the contract or by otherwise negotiating a termination with the counterparty a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity is recognized at the ceaseuse date costs to terminate a lease before the end of its term are recognized when the property is vacated other costs primarily consist of asset writeoffs which are expensed when incurred 

we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plan actual results may differ and thereby require us to record an additional provision or reverse a portion of such a provision 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in addition deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not based on the technical merits of the position that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

 42 

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods

2015  and 2014   

revenue 



total revenue increased by 2389 million  or 31  in 2015  compared to 2014  total revenue in 2015 of 101 billion included meru’s revenue from july 8 2015 to december 31 2015 of 281 million or 3 of total revenue excluding meru’s revenue our revenue was 9812 million an increase of 27 compared to the same period last year we experienced continued 

 45 

global diversification of revenue in 2015 the americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on an absolute dollar basis and all three regions showed growth on a percentage basis product revenue increased by 1162 million  or 32  in 2015 compared to 2014  product revenue in 2015 included revenue from meru of 222 million the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family across all product categories and in particular for our highend products for large enterprise customers service revenue increased by 1227 million  or 30  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase in service revenue was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods service revenue in 2015 included revenue from meru of 58 million 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



total gross margin increased by 16  percentage points in 2015  compared to 2014  as both product and service gross margins increased product gross margin increased by 21  percentage points in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to a greater mix of highend fortigate product sales compared to the same period last year such as our fortigate5000 series in addition product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as certain of our virtualized security solutions as well as inventory management efficiencies 

service gross margin increased during 2015 as compared to 2014 as we scaled efficiencies resulting from our ability to add and charge for more functionality and value to our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support offerings which yielded more value to our customers and which translated into improved service margins cost of service revenue increased by 167 million  primarily due to an 116 million increase in personnel costs related to headcount increases 

operating expenses 

  



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 352 million  or 29  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to an increase of 258 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products depreciation and other occupancyrelated costs increased by 36 million in 

 46 

addition during 2014 we had a reversal of 30 million related to a previously recorded liability for estimated contingent consideration we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization and integrate personnel from our acquisition of meru but expect research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue to remain at a relatively comparable level in 2016 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 1546 million  or 49  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to an increase of 1080 million in personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales and marketing headcount marketingrelated expenses increased by 169 million as we invested significantly in marketing investments to drive broader market awareness create a global marketing engine build broad market lead generation and nurture programs and accelerate pipeline in addition we incurred increases in travel expenses of 91 million and depreciation and occupancyrelated costs of 93 million as a percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expense increased as we accelerated the investment in our sales force and marketing programs to drive future growth we intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure and marketing strategy which are critical to support growth but expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue to remain at a relatively comparable level in 2016 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 302 million  or 73  in 2015  compared to 2014  personnel costs increased by 146 million as we continued to increase headcount in order to support our expanding business in addition professional fees increased by 69 million primarily due to legal services related to the assertion of our intellectual property and other rights in 2015 we also incurred 54 million in expenses related to business process design and reengineering in preparation of an erp system implementation and 17 million of costs related to the meru acquisition as a percentage of total revenue we expect general and administrative expense to remain at a relatively comparable level in 2016 

  

restructuring charges 

restructuring charges of 76 million  in 2015 primarily relate to the restructuring activities in connection with the meru acquisition to reduce our cost structure and improve operational efficiencies see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details including types of expenses incurred and the timing of future expenses and cash payments see also the “liquidity and capital resources” section of this part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

interest income and other expense — net 

  



interest income and other expense—net remained relatively consistent in 2015  compared to 2014  interest income varies depending on our average investment balances during the period types and mix of investments and market interest rates other expense—net consisted primarily of foreign exchange and related hedging gains and losses 

provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 53  for 2015  compared with an effective tax rate of 59  for 2014  the provision for income taxes for 2015  was comprised primarily of us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding 

 47 

taxes an increase in tax reserves as well as the inclusion of stockbased compensation benefits and transfer pricing allocations which impact jurisdictional income taxed at various tax rates the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2015 was primarily due to higher research and development credits additional tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense and lower foreign withholding taxes 

it is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2015 we had accrued 55 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of 17 million as of december 31 2014 

within the next twelve months we do not believe there will be a decrease in uncertain tax benefits that could significantly impact our effective tax rate 

2014  and 2013   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased by 1551 million or 25 in 2014 compared to 2013 the americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on an absolute dollar basis and all three regions showed growth on a percentage basis product revenue increased by 825 million or 30 compared to 2013 the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product due to increased demand for our highend products from large enterprise and service provider customers 

service revenue increased by 726 million or 22 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods 

 48 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



  

total gross margin decreased by 06 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 as product gross margins declined product gross margin decreased by 08 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an increase in warrantyrelated costs of 32 million and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of 24 million we also experienced increased freight costs of 20 million higher excess inventory writeoffs of 14 million increased personnelrelated costs of 09 million and increased occupancyrelated costs of 08 million 

service gross margin remained relatively consistent during 2014 as compared to 2013 cost of service revenue increased by 137 million primarily due to a 95 million increase in personnel costs including stockbased compensation related to headcount increases a 14 million increase in depreciation a 11 million increase in occupancyrelated costs and a 08 million increase in professional services 

operating expenses 

  



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 202 million or 20 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase of 120 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products in addition stockbased compensation increased by 40 million product development expenses such as supplies and thirdparty testing and prototypes increased by 34 million occupancyrelated costs and depreciation expense increased by 28 million and professional services costs increased by 10 million these increases were partially offset by a 30 million decrease in estimated contingent consideration 

sales and marketing

interest income and other expense — net 

  



the 01 million increase in interest income in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to interest earned on higher invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other expense—net for 2014 when compared to 2013 was the result of higher foreign exchange losses and the impact of a reevaluation of the functional currency selection of certain of our international subsidiaries 

provision for income taxes

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period 



 

 51 

 



 

 



seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend which has positively impacted billings and product revenue activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential customer buying which results in lower billings and product revenue although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has generally increased sequentially in each quarter except in the first quarter of 2015 product revenue in all of the quarters of 2015  was higher as compared to the same quarters in 2014  which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales and marketing organizations to a robust security market and to continued product innovation 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services and between products product gross margins on average throughout the year increased in 2015 primarily due to a greater mix of highend fortigate product sales compared to 2014 product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products in addition product gross margin was positively impacted by higher sales of software products such as certain of our virtualized security solutions as well as inventory management efficiencies service gross margins on average throughout the year increased in 2015 compared to 2014 as we scaled efficiencies resulting from our ability to add and charge for more functionality and value to our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support offerings which yielded more value to our customers and which translated into improved service margins 

 52 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as by our business acquisitions capital expenditures stock repurchases proceeds associated with stock option exercises and issuances of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan “espp” payment of taxes in connection with the net settlement of equity awards and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or may make in the future our previous stock repurchase program expired on december 31 2015 with an unused balance under the program of 625 million in january 2016 our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program which authorizes the repurchase of up to 2000 million of our outstanding common stock through december 31 2017 in recent years we have received significant capital resources as a result of the exercise of stock options and purchases under our espp we expect proceeds in future years to be impacted by our share price and the mix of stock options and rsus granted we expect to spend 350 million to 450 million in capital expenditures primarily related to expansion of our offices to support worldwide growth and the implementation of our erp system 

in december 2015 we received 90 million from a thirdparty for a release of claims in addition we agreed to a threeyear covenantnottosue of the 90 million of consideration received 20 million was used to offset contingent legal fees incurred in connection with the litigation and the remaining 70 million was deferred with the shortterm portion recorded as accrued liabilities and the longterm portion recorded as other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the deferral will be recognized ratably through 2018 as an offset to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 

as of december 31 2015  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 116 billion  were invested primarily in corporate debt securities commercial paper municipal bonds certificates of deposit and term deposits money market funds and us government and agency securities it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital provides liquidity and maximizes return without significantly increasing risk 

as of december 31 2015  3757 million  of our cash and investments were held by our international subsidiaries and are therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated while we do not intend to do so should this amount be repatriated most of it would be subject to us federal income tax that would be partially offset by foreign tax credits we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products historically we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisition activities in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

 53 

operating activities 

cash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity it is primarily comprised of net income as adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash adjustments consist primarily of stockbased compensation depreciation of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation and amortization of investment premiums 

  

 our operating activities during 2015 provided 2825 million  in cash as a result of our continued growth in billings and the ability to successfully manage our working capital additionally in 2015 we received 90 million related to a mutual threeyear covenantnottosue agreement changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in payments received from customers partially offset by an increase in payments to vendors 

our operating activities during 2014 provided 1966 million in cash as a result of profitability timing of billings and collections and the ability to successfully manage our working capital the primary sources of cash from operating activities during 2014 consisted of net income of 253 million increased by noncash adjustments of 939 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 774 million in 2014 we received 200 million pursuant to a sixyear mutual covenantnottosue and release agreement with palo alto networks inc changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase in payments received from customers and a receipt of cash related to the mutual covenantnottosue and release agreement partially offset by payments for inventory purchases prepayment of certain expenses and payments of income taxes during the period 

our operating activities during 2013 provided 1474 million in cash as a result of profitability timing of billings and collections and the ability to successfully manage our working capital the primary sources of cash from operating activities during 2013 consisted of net income of 443 million increased by noncash adjustments of 692 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 339 million changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily included an increase in payments received from customers partially offset by payments for inventory purchases 

investing activities 

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments purchases of property and equipment and payments made in connection with business acquisitions 

during 2015 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 380 million  used for the acquisition of meru in addition we spent 374 million  on capital expenditures including our purchases of certain real properties in sunnyvale california and sophia france for total cash of 139 million  the outflow of cash was partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities net of purchases from our investments of 744 million  

during 2014 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 322 million spent on capital expenditures partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities net of purchases from our investments of 29 million 

during 2013 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 1252 million of net purchases of investments 139 million for the purchases of property and equipment and 76 million for acquisitions 

financing activities 

the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plan and espp taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation and repurchase and retirement of common stock 

during 2015 cash used for financing activities was 216 million  primarily due to 600 million  used to repurchase our common stock this was partially offset by 384 million  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock net of taxes paid related to withholding upon issuance of rsus 

during 2014 cash provided by financing activities was 07 million as a result of proceeds of 553 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans this cash inflow was partially offset by 440 million used to repurchase our common stock and 106 million of taxes payment related to withholding upon the issuance of rsus 

during 2013 cash used in financing activities was 64 million as a result of our repurchase of 335 million of common stock and our netshare settlement of rsus of 15 million this was offset by receiving proceeds of 129 million 

 54 

and 127 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and espp respectively and an excess tax benefit from employee stock option exercises of 30 million 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  

  



 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during 2015  2014  and 2013  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncement 

see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities including corporate debt securities money market funds commercial paper municipal bonds us government and agency securities and certificates of deposit and term deposits the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2015  2014  and 2013  would have resulted in an insignificant decrease in our interest income in each of these periods 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the us are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar “cad” and euro “eur” to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to hedge balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions these contracts typically have maturities between one and three months we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance 

 55 

sheet accounts as other expense net in the consolidated statement of operations we recognized an expense of 32 million  in other expense—net in 2015  due to foreign currency transaction losses 

our hedging activities are intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements as our hedging activities are relatively shortterm in nature and are focused on the cad longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar against other foreign currencies such as the eur british pound “gbp” and chinese renminbi “cny” could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 25 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash balances as of december 31 2015 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e or 15d15e under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs 

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2015  to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management ’ s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control—integrated framework 2013  set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of meru which we acquired in july 2015 we have included the financial results of meru in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition total revenue subject to meru’s internal control over financial reporting represented approximately 3 of our consolidated total revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 total assets subject to meru’s internal control over financial reporting represented approximately 1 of our consolidated total assets as of december 31 2015 

based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2015  management reviewed the results of its assessment with our audit committee the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015  has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears in this item under the heading “report of independent registered public accounting firm” 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

in july 2015 we completed the acquisition of meru we are in the process of integrating meru into our systems and control environment as of december 31 2015 we believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f under the exchange act during the fourth quarter of 2015  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

our research and development expense was 1229 million  in fiscal 2014  1027 million  in fiscal 2013  and 811 million  in fiscal 2012  

intellectual property 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology as of december 31 2014  we had 191 issued us and foreign patents and 156 pending us 

 5 

and foreign patent applications we also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms 

despite our efforts to protect our rights in our technology unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights third parties have asserted are currently asserting and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected we typically indemnify our endcustomers distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties 

seasonality 

for information regarding seasonality in our sales see the section entitled “—quarterly results of operations—seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

• our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and technological expertise 

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

• brand recognition 

• customer service and support 

• sales and distribution capabilities 

• size and financial stability of operations and 

• breadth of product line 

our competitors include cisco systems inc “cisco” juniper networks inc “juniper” check point software technologies ltd “check point” intel through its acquisition of mcafee inc “mcafee” f5 networks inc “f5 networks” dell inc through its acquisition of sonicwall inc “sonicwall”  bluecoat systems inc “bluecoat” fireeye inc “fireeye” and palo alto networks inc “palo alto networks” amongst others 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance reliability and breadth our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance market their products better or achieve greater market acceptance than us in addition our larger competitors often have broader product lines are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets 

 6 

and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  our total headcount was 2854  fulltime equivalent employees none of our us employees are represented by a labor union however our employees in belgium finland france italy and spain are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors may lose some or all of their investment 

risks related to our business   

our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 

  

   

   

 

   

 

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 8 

   

   

   

 

 

   

   

   

   

   

 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global economic conditions weak economic conditions in certain geographies or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our channel partners reduced unit sales and slower or declining growth 

our billings and revenue growth may slow or may not continue 

  

 billings and revenue growth may slow or we may experience a decrease in billings and revenue for a number of reasons including a slowdown in demand for our products or services increased competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market softness in demand in certain geographies or industry verticals such as the service provider industry or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities our expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expected and if our investments in sales and marketing and other functional areas do not result in expected billings and revenue growth and we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue do not appropriately manage our cost structure or encounter unanticipated liabilities any failure by us to maintain profitability and continue our billings and revenue growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

 9 

we rely significantly on revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services which may decline and because we recognize revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in purchases of fortigate appliances endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers’ spending levels if our sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business will suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact our billings and revenue furthermore we recognize fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically from one to three years but in some instances has been as long as five years as a result much of the fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed fortiguard security subscription or forticare technical support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in sales of new or renewals of existing fortiguard security subscriptions or forticare technical support services is not reflected in full in our statements of operations until future periods our fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

  

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

 

  10 

otherwise and may adversely impact financial results as compared to those already reported or forecasted and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements 

 

   

   

   

product and service sales may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change over time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in litigation regulatory action costs of investigation delays in revenue recognition delays in financial reporting financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to larger endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large enterprises service providers and government organizations while we have experienced some success selling to service providers and enterprises we have experienced less traction selling to certain government organizations and there can be no assurance that we will be successful selling to these customer segments sales to enterprises service providers and government organizations involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smalltomidsized entities these risks include 

  

   

 

   

 

   

large enterprises service providers and government organizations often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases over 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with endcustomers along with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to larger endcustomers due to the lengthy nature the size and scope and stringent requirements of these evaluations we typically provide evaluation products to these customers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales if we are unsuccessful in converting these evaluations into sales we may experience an increased inventory of used products and potentially increased writeoffs in addition product purchases by enterprises service providers and government organizations are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays furthermore service providers represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business enterprises service providers and government organizations typically have longer 

 11 

implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers if sales expected from a large endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders or not place orders commensurate with our expectations if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture certain products or ship products increases for any reason this could result in inventory shortfalls management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell 

  

in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have in the past experienced inventory shortages due to more demand for certain products than we had forecasted if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder and chief executive officer and michael xie our cofounder president and chief technology officer and any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives the loss of the services or distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering and sales may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we experience turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highlyskilled personnel is frequently intense especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel such as the san francisco bay area and vancouver canada we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information 

the average sales prices of our products may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the average sales prices for our products may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts we offer a change in our mix of products anticipation of the introduction of new products or promotional programs competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings 

 12 

may reduce the price of products that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or may bundle them with other products additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the average sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter for example on average over the past eight quarters our shipments during the last two weeks of each quarter accounted for approximately 33 of aggregate billings for each quarter if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our logistics partners’ inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements or any shipment delays based on labor disputes at shipping ports our billings and revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products and to improve lead generation our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large enterprise service provider and government organization market we have historically had relatively low spending on certain marketing activities while we have recently been increasing our investments in sales and marketing it is not clear that these investments will continue to result in increased revenues if our investments in additional sales personnel or if our marketing programs are not successful in continuing to create market awareness of our company and products our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

  

substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners which include distributors and resellers we depend upon our channel partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

  

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products and incentivize them to sell our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services and may purchase more inventory than they can sell our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions in addition if our channel partners’ financial condition or operations weaken it could negatively impact their ability to sell our product and services they may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products they may also have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot assure you that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 exclusive networks group which distributed our solutions to a large group of resellers and endcustomers accounted for 15 12 and 11 of our total revenue respectively in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and 

 13 

reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies we depend on our global channel partners to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

  actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach or misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

  

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic or cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks we cannot ensure that our products will prevent all security threats because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard security subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortigate appliances and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of our customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products and services and in some instances subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized thirdparty any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our business and operations have experienced growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

our business has grown over the last several years we rely heavily on information technology systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews certain of these systems were developed by us for our internal use and as such may have a higher risk of failure or not receive the same level of support as systems purchased from and supported by external technology companies in addition we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on the manual processing of emails internally and receipt   of customer purchase orders through email and to a lesser extent through electronic data interchange   

 14 

from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a majority of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter a significant interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that quarter to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure operating and administrative systems and controls and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems controls and processes such as system access and change management controls in a timely or efficient manner we purchased a new enterprise resource planning system during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we are in the early stages of implementing the new system and as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs in connection with implementing the system in addition we may experience some disruption during the system implementation process our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our productivity and the quality of our products and services may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations 

  

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation expense valuation of inventory warranty liabilities goodwill and other longlived assets investments accounting for income taxes litigation and settlement costs and other loss contingencies sales returns and allowances reserve for bad debt and the accounting for business combinations 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners 

  

our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers in asia and elsewhere reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

 15 

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production or shipping interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages quality problems or strike or other labor disruption at one of our manufacturing partners or shipping ports or locations would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary fortiasic which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and tsmc faraday using umc’s foundry kmicro using tsmc’s foundry and renesas using umc’s foundry manufacture our asics on a purchase order basis and umc and tsmc do not guarantee any capacity and could reject orders from faraday kmicro or renesas or could try to increase pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary or long term inventory shortages of our fortiasic as well as increased costs our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes of products if any of these suppliers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics or specific product models our business would be harmed 

  

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the european union’s “eu” restriction of hazardous substances directive “rohs” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals known as “conflict minerals” that are contained in our products have originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country as a result of the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted new disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products under these rules we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers perform supply chain due diligence and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules including costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls moreover the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage and may result in the loss of sales and customers and increased component costs may result in lower gross margins 

  

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of central processing units from intel advanced micro devices inc and rminetlogic corporation network chips from broadcom corporation marvell technology group ltd and intel and hard drives from western digital technologies inc the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

 16 

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a majority of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar although we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currencydenominated operating expenses in addition a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability restriction on sales andor impair our ability to compete in international markets 

  

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the united states only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with us export licensing us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits for orders placed by partners as stocking orders for example we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

  

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permittinglicensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with 

 17 

international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

  

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the near future if this exemption is revoked if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

  

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government organizations which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to government organizations sales to government organizations are subject to a number of risks selling to government organizations can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense with long sales cycles and without any assurance that we will win a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

 

 

 

 

 18 

the rules and regulations applicable to sales to government organizations may also negatively impact sales to other organizations to date we have had limited traction in sales to us federal government agencies and any future sales to government organizations is uncertain all of our sales to government organizations have been made indirectly through our distribution channel government organizations may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such government organization the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

  

false detection of viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

  

our antivirus and our intrusion prevention services may falsely detect viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our antispam and antimalware services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures any such false identification of important files or applications could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

if our internal network system is compromised by computer hackers public perception of our products and services will be harmed 

  

we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective network security protection because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers although we have not experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems it could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services in addition such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services to our endcustomers if this happens our revenue could decline and our business could suffer 

  

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

  

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products if we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many large endcustomers service provider and government organization endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers because of their more complex deployments if we fail to meet the requirements of our larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with enterprises service providers and government organizations as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 19 

we could be subject to changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions where a number of our subsidiaries are organized our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

  

 

   

   

   

   

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the financial accounting standards board “fasb” standard in addition the standard applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain foreign countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

although we currently do not have a valuation allowance we may in the future be required to establish one we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

  

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

  

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by

jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimated our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations 

  

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

  

in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities if tax authorities challenge the relative mix of us and international income our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

  

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products or technologies and intellectual property such as patents if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial for example in the second quarter of 2014 we recognized an impairment charge of 24 million for intangible assets from our acquisition of coyote point systems inc acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property could significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

  

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the 

 21 

united states or other countries and in some circumstances we may be required to indemnify a customer in full without a limitation on liability for certain liabilities including potential liabilities that are not contractually limited the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not cover such claim at all or may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us and in some instances may subject us to potential liability that is not contractually limited in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

  

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest labor disruption and terrorism 

  

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire power outages floods or other catastrophic events could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products on a timely basis and assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in us missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability civil unrest labor disruptions acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole for example recently ports in the west coast of the united states have experienced work slowdowns related to ongoing union labor contract negotiations given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

  

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

  

our url database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’  expectations 

  

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further 

 22 

the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations could impair the growth of our business 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

  

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

  

 23 

demand for our products may be limited by market perception that individual products from one vendor that provide multiple layers of security protection in one product are inferior to point solution network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of most of our products depend on increased demand for incorporating broad security functionality in one appliance if the market for these products fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view “allinone” network security solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that such products of ours provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform our solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of our product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that “allinone” solutions may be suitable only for small and medium sized businesses because such solution lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large enterprise service provider and government organization endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with our market in general demand for multisecurity functionality products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include companies such as blue coat check point cisco dellsonicwall f5 networks fireeye intelmcafee juniper palo alto networks and others 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources such as juniper’s acquisition of netscreen technologies inc intel’s acquisition of mcafee mcafee’s acquisition of stonesoft check point’s acquisition of nokia corporations’ security appliance business and dell’s acquisition of sonicwall and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions as a result of such acquisitions competition in our market may 

 24 

continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco f5 networks and juniper offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from time to time legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected 

 25 

other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

  

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license the gnu lesser public license lgpl the bsd license the apache license and others from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties are currently asserting have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they may also assert such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a thirdparty even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies nonpracticing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes general commercial litigation and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion 

we have several ongoing patent lawsuits and several nonpracticing entity patent holding companies have sent us 

 26 

letters proposing that we license certain of their patents given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 as well as other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these and proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal 2014 as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2014 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in fiscal 2015 or future periods in may 2013 the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” issued an updated version of its internal control  integrated framework “2013 framework” which was originally issued in 1992 to help organizations design implement and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls as of december 31 2014 we completed our transition to the 2013 framework we expect the continuing requirements of the new framework to increase our legal accounting and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming and costly and place a significant burden on our personnel systems and resources if our internal controls or disclosure controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

  

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

  

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition which are effective for us beginning on january 1 2017 the increased use of fair value measure and financial instruments could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which would have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our reporting obligations 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

 27 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us or announcements regarding our share repurchase program and the timing and amount of shares we purchase under the program for example in fiscal 2014 the closing price of our common stock ranged from 1902 to 3131 

  

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

  

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

we provide high performance cyber security solutions to some of the largest enterprises service providers and government organizations across the globe including a majority of the 2014 fortune 100 our cyber security solutions are fast and secure and designed to provide broad highperformance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the it infrastructure of our endcustomers worldwide 

our core product platform is the fortigate physical and virtual appliance which ships with a set of broad security services including firewall vpn application control intrusion prevention web filtering and advanced threat protection “atp” these security services are enabled by fortiguard which provides extensive threat research and a global cloud 

 33 

network to deliver protection services to each fortigate appliance fortigate also has extensive networking capability such as switching routing native internet protocol version 6 “ipv6” and different modes of deployment fortimanager provides central management and fortianalyzer provides reporting and analytics the fortigate platform can be extended to provide enhanced capabilities for example it can be used as a wireless controller for access points an external sandbox can also be attached for local atp analysis 

customers select the functions or combination of functions that best meet their specific security requirements such as a highspeed dcfw at the network core a ngfw at the edge or a broad utm solution at branch sites we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances which range from the fortigate20 to 100 series designed for small businesses fortigate200 to 800 series for midsized enterprises to the fortigate1000 to 5000 series for large enterprises and service providers our network security platform also includes our fortiguard security subscription services which endcustomers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to application control antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality endcustomers can also choose to purchase forticare technical support services for our products endcustomers also often use fortimanager and fortianalyzer products in conjunction with a fortigate deployment to provide centralized management and analysis and reporting capabilities 

we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise such as our wireless access point advanced threat protection secure email gateway web application firewalls application delivery controllers databases security product ddos security product and endpoint security product for employee computers and mobile devices sales of these complementary products have grown in recent quarters although these products still represented less than 10 of our total revenue in fiscal 2014 

financial highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revenue grew as a result of our focus on growth and our strategy to increase sales capacity and invest in our marketing activities during fiscal 2014 we also continued to gain traction with several recently introduced fortigate products including demand for certain of our high speed low latency nextgeneration enterprise data center security products 

during fiscal 2014  we made significant investments in sales and marketing to increase brand awareness and grow our global sales force and distribution channels to expand our global presence both geographically and by industry segment we continue to focus on selling to large customers such as enterprise service providers and government organizations worldwide as a result we had increased sales from large enterprises and enterprise data center deployments with particular strength in the telecommunication technology government and financial sectors 

in fiscal 2014 sales of highend fortigate products fortigate1000 to 5000 series increased due to enterprise adoption of our highend appliances such as the fortigate1500d and 3700d the percentage of our fortigate related billings from highend products increased from 34 in fiscal 2013 to 38 in fiscal 2014 while the midrange products decreased from 29 in fiscal 2013 to 26 in fiscal 2014 and the entrylevel products decreased from 38 in fiscal 2013 to 36 in fiscal 2014 

 34 

we also continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position we believe that continued product innovation has strengthened our technology and resulted in market share gains as evidenced by our introduction of the fortigate1500d and 3700d enterprise security appliances 

in fiscal 2014  operating expenses increased 32  compared to fiscal 2013  the increase was primarily driven by our accelerated pace of hiring and marketing investments to support our growth as we continued to invest in expanding our sales coverage marketing capabilities developing new products and scaling our customer support organization to meet the needs of our customer base headcount including full time equivalent employees increased to 2854 as of december 31 2014 from 2308 as of december 31 2013 

business model 

our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers who in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to governmentfocused resellers large service providers and major systems integrators who have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements typically fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our physical and virtual appliances we invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and technical support services and the invoice generally becomes payable within 30 to 90 days we generally recognize product revenue upfront based on the allocated revenue value and defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal of existing fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services contracts we recognize the related services revenue over the service period which is typically one to three years from the date the endcustomer registers for these services the date on which the services can first be used by the customer although it can be as long as five years sales of new and renewal services increase our deferred revenue balance which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations 

key metrics 

we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies the following table summarizes revenue deferred revenue billings nongaap cash cash equivalents and investments net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow nongaap we discuss revenue below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss our cash cash equivalents and investments and net cash provided by operating activities below under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue billings nongaap and free cash flow nongaap are discussed immediately below the following table 



  

deferred revenue  our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from fortiguard security subscription and forticare support service contracts we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods 

billings nongaap we define billings as revenue recognized during a period plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations during the period we consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because deferred revenue which is impacted by billings is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business and revenue from previously deferred amounts has historically represented a majority of the revenue that we recognize in any particular period there are a number of 

 35 

limitations related to the use of billings as opposed to revenue calculated in accordance with gaap first billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue second we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding gaap revenue and evaluating billings together with revenue calculated in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of billings to revenue the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided below 



free cash flow nongaap  we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after the acquisition of property and equipment can be used for strategic opportunities including investing in our business making strategic acquisitions repurchasing outstanding common stock and strengthening the balance sheet analysis of free cash flow facilitates comparisons of our operating results to competitors’ operating results a limitation of using free cash flow as opposed to the gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating liquidity is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash cash equivalents and investments balances for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures and cash provided by or used for other investing and financing activities we compensate for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the cash flow statement and under “—liquidity and capital resources” a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided below 



components of operating results 

revenue 

we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of our products and fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support services revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

  

  36 

granted stock rotation rights limited rights of return as well as rebates for sales of our products the arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not fixed and determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sellthrough as a percentage of total revenue we expect our product revenue may vary from quartertoquarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors discussed below under “—quarterly results of operations” but generally may remain at relatively comparable levels  as services revenue becomes a larger portion of our business as our customers renew existing services contracts and we expand our customer base 

 

beginning in fiscal 2014 we combined ratable and other revenue with services revenue to present the combined amounts as services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations the related cost of revenue and gross profit have also been combined to conform to the current period presentation ratable and other revenue is not material and is not expected to become material in the future 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

 

 

gross profit  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products any excess inventory writeoffs product costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services we believe our overall gross margin for the near term will remain at levels comparable or slightly lower to that achieved in fiscal 2014  

services revenue has a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher services gross margins compared to product gross margins during fiscal 2014  service margins remained relatively consistent compared to fiscal 2013 

  

  operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries benefits bonuses sales commissions and stockbased compensation we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees 

  37 

related expenses the majority of our research and development is focused on both software development and the ongoing development of our hardware platform we record all research and development expenses as incurred our development teams are primarily located in canada and the united states 

 

 

interest income  interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities municipal bonds certificates of deposit and term deposits and us government and agency debt securities 

other expense net  other expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange and related hedging gains and losses foreign exchange gains and losses relate to foreign currency exchange remeasurement the hedging gains and losses are related to our settled balance sheet hedges 

provision for income taxes  we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than us tax rates and may be subject to us income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the us research and development tax credits withholding taxes nondeductible stockbased compensation expense and adjustments related to our intercompany transfer pricing 

the income tax provision for fiscal 2014  was comprised primarily of domestic income taxes foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes and income tax reserves our effective tax rate approximates the us federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes research and development tax credits when applicable foreign withholding tax nondeductible stockbased compensation expense foreign income subject to lower tax than the us and adjustments related to intercompany transfer pricing 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosures our estimates include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation expense valuation of inventory warranty liabilities investments goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our hardware software fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services and other services through our channel partners and a direct sales force 

 38 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

  

   

   

 

 

we recognize product revenue for sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to endcustomers upon shipment based on general revenue recognition accounting guidance once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met certain distributors are granted stock rotation rights limited rights of return as well as rebates for sales of our products the arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not typically fixed or determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sellthrough for sales that include endcustomer acceptance criteria revenue is recognized upon acceptance 

substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services which consist of security subscriptions and technical support services security services provide access to our antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades maintenance releases and patches telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support we recognize revenue from these services ratably over the contractual service period revenue related to subsequent renewals of these services are recognized over the term of the renewal agreement 

we offer certain sales incentives to channel partners we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances and   record reductions to revenue for rebates and estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs additionally in limited circumstances we may permit endcustomers distributors and resellers to return our products subject to varying limitations for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience 

our sales arrangements typically contain multiple elements such as hardware subscription technical support and other services the majority of our hardware appliance products contain our operating system software that together function to deliver the essential functionality of the product our products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price using vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if it exists or thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable we use our best estimate of selling price “besp” for that deliverable revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 

  

we determine vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement based on the historical pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately in establishing vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical standalone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately which is generally unavailable for our hardware appliances we use besp as our selling price for our support and other services we generally use vsoe as our selling price estimate when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe for our support and other services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple historical factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels that fall within a reasonably narrow range as a percentage of list price 

for multipleelement arrangements where software deliverables are included revenue is allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in 

 39 

the arrangement based on the estimated selling price hierarchy the amount allocated to the software deliverables is then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when vsoe of fair value exists if evidence of vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all software allocated revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period the same residual method and vsoe of fair value principles apply for our multiple element arrangements that contain only software elements 

stockbased compensation expense 

employees stock options   we estimate the fair value of employee stock options awarded to our employees using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model for all employee stock options we recognize expense net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period using the straightline method our option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term and forfeiture rate the assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment   during fiscal 2014 stock options granted to employees were not significant a 10 change in any of these assumptions would not have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

employee stock purchase plan  we estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” using the blackscholes pricing model and is amortize the fair value over the requisite service period using the straightline method the pricing model requires the input of the fair value of our common stock and subjective assumptions including the expected term of the award the expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock our espp provides for consecutive sixmonth offering periods and we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of espp shares a 10 change in any of these assumptions would not have a material impact on our stockbased compensation expense 

restricted stock units  we account for the fair value of restricted stock units “rsus” awarded to employees and members of our board of directors using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant rsus are payable in shares of our common stock as the periodic vesting requirements are satisfied rsus generally vest over a fouryear period if the employees contractors or directors as applicable remain with us for the duration of the vesting period for all rsus we recognize expense net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period using the straightline method 

performance stock units performance stock units “psus” are rsus that contain both servicebased and marketbased vesting conditions psus vest over a specified service period upon the satisfaction of certain marketbased vesting conditions and settle into shares of our common stock upon vesting over a two or threeyear period the fair value of a psu is calculated using the monte carlo simulation model on the date of grant and is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant modified to reflect the impact of the marketbased vesting condition including the estimated payout level based on that condition we do not adjust compensation cost for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the marketbased vesting conditions 

valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record additional inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in estimating future tax consequences generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

 40 

we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities we provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed more likely than not that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap which defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements the tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods

 43 

revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product due to increased demand for our highend products from large enterprise and service provider customers 

services and other revenue increased by 726 million  or 22  in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base as well as the renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



total gross margin decreased by 06  percentage points in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  as product gross margins declined product gross margin decreased by 08  percentage points in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  due to an increase in warrantyrelated costs of 32 million and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of 24 million we also experienced increased freight costs of 20 million higher excess inventory writeoffs of 14 million increased personnelrelated costs of 09 million and increased occupancyrelated costs of 08 million 

services and other gross margin remained relatively consistent during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 cost of services and other revenue increased by 137 million  primarily due to a 95 million increase in personnel costs including stockbased compensation related to headcount increases a 14 million increase in depreciation a 11 million increase in occupancyrelated costs and a 08 million increase in professional services 

operating expenses 

  



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 202 million  or 20  in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase of 120 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products in addition stockbased compensation increased by 40 million product development expenses such as supplies and thirdparty testing and prototypes increased by 34 million occupancyrelated costs and depreciation expense increased by 28 million and professional services costs increased by 10 million these increases were partially offset by a 30 million decrease in estimated contingent consideration for discussion of the contingent consideration see note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual 

 44 

report on form 10k we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization but expect research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue to remain at comparable levels in fiscal 2015 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 908 million  or 40  in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase of 588 million in personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to drive continued market share gains globally marketingrelated expenses increased by 129 million as we invested significantly in marketing to capture market share particularly in the enterprise market including costs related to tradeshows and lead generation campaigns in addition we incurred increases in stockbased compensation expense of 72 million depreciation and other expenses of 44 million travel expenses of 42 million supplies of 22 million and occupancyrelated cost of 10 million as a percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses increased as we accelerated the investment in our sales force and marketing campaigns to drive future growth we intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure and marketing which are critical to support growth and expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue to increase in fiscal 2015 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 64 million  or 18  in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013  personnel costs including stockbased compensation increased by 68 million as we continued to increase our headcount in order to support our expanding business in addition professional services fees increased 08 million partially offset by a decrease of 13 million in occupancyrelated costs including depreciation and supplies we expect general and administrative expense to increase slightly as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2015 

interest income and other expense — net 

  



the 01 million  increase in interest income in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  was primarily due to interest earned on higher invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other expense—net for fiscal 2014  when compared to fiscal 2013 was the result of higher foreign exchange losses and the impact of a reevaluation of the functional currency selection of certain of our international subsidiaries 

provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 59  for fiscal 2014  compared with an effective tax rate of 42  for fiscal 2013  the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2014  was comprised primarily of us federal and state taxes other foreign income taxes foreign withholding taxes discrete events resulting from an increase in tax reserves as well as the inclusion of stockbased compensation benefits and transfer pricing allocations which impact jurisdictional income taxed at various tax rates the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase in estimated tax liability related to foreign operations an increase in tax reserves an increase in nontax deductible stockbased compensation expense and limitations on utilizing foreign withholding tax credits 

it is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2014 we had accrued 17 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of 10 million as of december 31 2013 

 45 

within the next twelve months we do not believe there will be a decrease in uncertain tax benefits that could significantly impact our effective tax rate 

fiscal years 2013  and 2012   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased by 817 million or 15 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on an absolute dollar basis and all three regions showed growth on a percentage basis the growth in emea was slightly lower due to a slowdown in the macroeconomic environment in that area product revenue increased by 291 million or 12 compared to fiscal 2012 the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product due to increased demand across all product categories from our entrylevel and midrange products for smaller enterprises and branch deployments to our highend products for large enterprise and service provider customers services and other revenue increased by 526 million or 18 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of fortiguard security subscription and forticare technical support contracts sold to a larger customer base as well as renewals of similar contracts sold in earlier periods

total gross margin decreased by 18 percentage points in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 as both product and services and other gross margins declined product gross margin decreased by 35 percentage points in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to a slightly higher mix of sales of entrylevel products particularly several highvolume distributed enterprise retail and education deals sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we also experienced higher warrantyrelated costs of 25 million increased freight costs of 15 million increased occupancyrelated costs of 11 million and higher 

 46 

excess inventory writeoffs of 07 million services and other gross margin decreased by 08 percentage points during fiscal 2013 primarily due to our continued investments in our technical support organization to accommodate our expanding customer base and higher service level expectations from our enterprise customers in addition we experienced growth in our professional consulting services which have lower gross margins than our support and subscription businesses cost of services and other revenue increased by 126 million primarily due to a 99 million increase in personnel costs related to headcount increases a 11 million increase in stockbased compensation expense and a 24 million increase in depreciation and other expenses 

operating expenses 

  



research and development expense 

research and development expense increased by 216 million or 27 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase of 117 million in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products in addition stockbased compensation expense increased by 40 million product development expenses such as thirdparty testing and prototypes increased by 20 million acquisitionrelated costs increased by 19 million and depreciation and other expenses increased by 21 million

interest income and other expense — net 

  



the 03 million increase in interest income in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to interest earned on higher invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other expense—net for fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012 was the result of higher foreign exchange losses 

 47 

provision for income taxes 

  



our effective tax rate was 42 for fiscal 2013 compared with an effective tax rate of 36 for fiscal 2012 the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2013 was comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes as well as the inclusion of stockbased compensation benefits and cost allocations which affected the transfer pricing calculations among the united states and some of our foreign subsidiaries the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in profits subject to us tax a decrease in stockbased compensation benefits and their corresponding impact on the transfer pricing calculations among the united states and some of our foreign subsidiaries 

during january 2013 the us federal research and development tax credit was reinstated retroactively to fiscal 2012 the us federal research and development tax credit benefit was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 which was the period of enactment

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend which has positively impacted sales activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential billings and product revenue which results in lower revenue in the third quarter we generally experience lower sequential billings and revenue in europe due to reduced economic activity in europe during the summer months but this may not always be the case similarly our operating income has been affected by these historical trends because operating expenses are relatively fixed in the nearterm although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of each quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has generally increased sequentially in each quarter except in the first quarter of 2014 product revenue in all of the quarters of fiscal 2014  was higher as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2013  which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales and marketing organizations and continued product innovation 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services product gross margins on average throughout the fiscal year slightly decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2013 due to product mix product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products service gross margins on average throughout the fiscal year remained relatively consistent in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013

liquidity and capital resources 

  



liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions capital expenditures stock repurchases proceeds associated with stock option exercises and issuances of common stock and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or may make in the future in january 2014 we received a cash payment of 200 million pursuant to a six year mutual covenantnottosue and release agreement with palo alto networks inc as of december 31 2014 1225 million remains available for future share repurchases under our stock repurchase program which will be financed through our available working capital in recent years we have received significant capital resources related to the exercise of stock options and purchases under our espp we expect proceeds in future years to be impacted by our share price and the mix of stock options and rsus issued we expect to spend approximately 420 million related to our capital expenditures primarily related to purchase of computer equipment expansion of our offices as well as the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system in fiscal 2015 

as of december 31 2014  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 9917 million  were held for workingcapital purposes and were invested primarily in corporate debt securities commercial paper municipal bonds certificates of deposit and term deposits money market funds and us government and agency debt securities it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital provides liquidity and maximizes return without significantly increasing risk 

as of december 31 2014  2656 million  of our cash and investments was held by our international subsidiaries and is therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated while we do not intend to do so should this amount be repatriated it would be subject to us federal income tax which would be partially offset by foreign tax credits we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products historically we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisition activities in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

operating activities 

cash generated by operating activities is our primary source of liquidity it is primarily comprised of net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities noncash adjustments consist primarily of stockbased compensation depreciation of property and equipment amortization of intangible assets excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation and amortization of investment premiums

the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to timing of purchases maturities and sales of investments purchases of property and equipment and payments made in connection with acquisitions 

during fiscal 2014 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 322 million spent on capital expenditures partially offset by positive cash flow due to maturities net of purchases from our investments of 29 million 

during fiscal 2013 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 1252 million of net purchases of investments 139 million for the purchases of property and equipment and 76 million for acquisitions 

during fiscal 2012 cash used for investing activities was primarily due to 1594 million of net purchases of investments 221 million for the purchases of property and equipment and 12 million for acquisitions 

financing activities

the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  

  



 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during fiscal 2014  fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncement 

see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper money market funds government and corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in fiscal 2014  fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  would have resulted in a decrease in our interest income in each of these periods of 05 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the us are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar “cad” to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to hedge balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions these contracts typically have maturities between one and three months we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts as other expense net in the consolidated statement of operations we recognized an expense of 32 million  in other expense net in fiscal 2014  due to foreign currency transaction losses 

 53 

our hedging activities are intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements as our hedging activities are relatively shortterm in nature and are focused on cad longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar against other foreign currencies such as the euro “eur” british pound “gbp” and chinese renminbi “cny” could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 22 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash accounts as of december 31 2014 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers our current manufacturing partners include flextronics international ltd microstar international co ltd adlink technology inc senao networks inc and a number of taiwanbased manufacturers we submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured the delivery date and other delivery terms once our products are manufactured they are sent to either our headquarters in sunnyvale california or to our logistics partner in taoyuan city taiwan where accessory packaging and qualitycontrol testing are performed we believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to conserve capital better adjust manufacturing volumes to meet changes in demand and more quickly deliver products while allowing us to focus resources on our core competencies our proprietary fortiasics which are the key to the performance of our appliances are fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by united microelectronics corporation “umc” and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited “tsmc” faraday technology corporation using umc’s foundry kawasaki microelectronics america inc “kmicro” using tsmc’s foundry and renesas electronics corporation “renesas” using umc’s foundry manufacture our asics on a purchase order basis accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for the fabrication of our asics could be increased on short notice 

the components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or more frequently by our contract manufacturers some of the components important to our business including specific types of central processing units from intel corporation “intel” network chips from broadcom corporation “broadcom” marvell technology group ltd “marvell” and intel and solidstate drives siliconbased storage device from ocz technology group inc and samsung electronics co ltd are available from a limited or sole source of supply 

we have no longterm contracts related to the manufacturing of our asics or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms 

for information regarding the geographical disbursement of our longlived assets see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

we focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and systems and adding new features to existing products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that are or are expected to be needed by our endcustomers our success in designing developing manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors including the identification of market demand for new products product selection timely implementation of product design and development product performance effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2013  our research and development organization had headcount of 702  people predominantly in canada the united states “us” and china our research and development expense was 1027 million  in fiscal 2013  811 million  in fiscal 2012  and 636 million  in fiscal 2011  

intellectual property 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology as of december 31 2013  we had 130  issued us patents 21  issued chinese patents 4  issued taiwanese patents and 1  issued japanese patent which expire at various dates between 2019 and 2031 and 105  patent 

 5 

applications pending for examination in the united states and 7  patent applications pending for examination in china we also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot provide assurance that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights third parties have in the past asserted and may in the future assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected we typically indemnify our endcustomers distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties 

seasonality 

for information regarding seasonality see the section entitled “—quarterly results of operations—seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

  

• technological expertise 

  

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

  

• brand recognition 

  

• customer service and support 

  

• sales and distribution capabilities 

  

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

  

• size and financial stability of operations and 

  

• breadth of product line 

our competitors include networking companies such as cisco systems inc “cisco” and juniper networks inc “juniper” security vendors such as check point software technologies ltd “check point” mcafee inc “mcafee” acquired by intel sourcefire inc “sourcefire” acquired by cisco stonesoft corporation “stonesoft” acquired by mcafee sonicwall inc “sonicwall” acquired by dell inc “dell” bluecoat systems inc bluecoat fireeye inc and palo alto networks inc “palo alto networks” and other point solution security vendors 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance reliability and breadth our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and 

 6 

leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products in addition our larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

environment 

our business and operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in various jurisdictions around the world including the waste electrical and electronic equipment and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment regulations adopted by the european union many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business we seek to operate our business in compliance with such laws we are currently subject to laws relating to the materials and content of our products and certain requirements relating to product take back and recycling environmental regulation is increasing particularly outside of the united states and we expect that our international operations will be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements which may expose us to additional costs to date our compliance costs relating to environmental regulations have not had a material impact on our business results of operations or financial condition 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  our total headcount was 2308  people including contractors we had 702  in research and development 870  in sales and marketing 540  in services and support 49  in manufacturing operations and 147  in a general and administrative capacity as of december 31 2013  our headcount was 595  people in the united states 726  in canada 208  in china 119  in france and 660  in other countries 

none of our us employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us however our employees in france spain and italy are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors may lose some or all of their investment 

risks related to our business   

our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 

  

   

   

 

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 8 

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global economic conditions weak economic conditions in certain geographies or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our channel partners reduced unit sales and slower or little to no growth 

our billings and revenue growth may slow or may not continue 

  

 billings and revenue growth may slow or we may experience a decrease in billings and revenue for a number of reasons including a slowdown in demand for our products or services an increase in competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market softness in demand in certain geographies or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities for example we experienced lower than expected billings during the first quarter of 2013 due to a number of factors including decreased sales in the service provider market and slower sales in latin america and europe middle east and africa “emea” our expenses as a percentage of total revenue may be higher than expected if our revenue is lower than expectations and we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue do not appropriately manage our cost structure or encounter unanticipated liabilities any failure by us to maintain profitability and continue our billings and revenue growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

we rely significantly on revenue from subscription and support services which may decline and because we recognize revenue from subscription and support services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of subscription and support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our subscription and support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue sales of new or renewal subscription and support services contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number 

 9 

of factors including endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers’ spending levels if our sales of new or renewal subscription and support services contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business will suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for subscription or support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact subscription and support revenue furthermore we recognize subscription and support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically from one to three years but in some instances has been as long as five years as a result much of the subscription and support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription and support services contracts entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscription or support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions or support services is not reflected in full in our statements of operations until future periods our subscription and support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal support services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

  

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

 

 

   

   

   

product and service sales may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change from time to 

 10 

time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to larger endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large enterprises service providers and governmental entities sales to enterprises service providers and governmental entities involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smalltomidsized entities these risks include 

  

   

 

   

 

   

large enterprises service providers and governmental entities often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases over 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to larger endcustomers due to the lengthy nature the size and scope and stringent requirements of these evaluations we typically provide evaluation products to these customers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales if we are unsuccessful in converting these evaluations into sales we may experience an increased inventory of used products and potentially increased writeoffs in addition product purchases by enterprises service providers and governmental entities are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays furthermore service providers represent our largest industry vertical and consolidation or changes in buying behavior by larger customers within this industry could negatively impact our business finally enterprises service providers and governmental entities typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers if sales expected from a large endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the 

 11 

particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture certain products or ship products increases for any reason this could result in inventory shortfalls management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell 

  

in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we experienced inventory shortages in the first quarter of 2013 due to more demand for certain products than we had forecasted if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder and chief executive officer and michael xie our cofounder president and chief technology officer and any of our senior sales leaders or functional area leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives for example our prior chief financial officer and chief operating officer departed in december 2013 in addition key personnel may be distracted by activities unrelated to our business the loss of the services or distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering and sales may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we experience turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highlyskilled personnel is frequently intense especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel the san francisco bay area vancouver canada and beijing china we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information 

the average sales prices of our products may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the average sales prices for our products may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts we offer a change in our mix of products anticipation of the introduction of new products or promotional programs competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or may bundle them with other products additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the average sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

 12 

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s billings and revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter for example on average over the past eight quarters our shipments during the last two weeks of each quarter accounted for approximately 36  of aggregate billings for each quarter if expected orders at the end of any quarter are delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our logistics partners’ inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our billings and revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

  

substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners which include distributors and resellers we depend upon our channel partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

  

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements they may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products they may also have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot assure you that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

  actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach or misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

  

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic or cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortigate appliances and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products and services we may not be able to correct any security flaws or 

 13 

vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized thirdparty any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our business and operations have experienced growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

our business has grown over the last several years we rely heavily on information technology systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews however we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on the manual processing of emails internally and from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a majority of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter a significant interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that quarter to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure operating and administrative systems and controls and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement requisite improvements to these systems controls and processes such as system access and change management controls in a timely or efficient manner we are moving our us headquarters at the end of february which move could cause system and other disruption we are also in the planning stages for a new enterprise resource planning system and when the new system is implemented such change may cause disruption and additional cost in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses our productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations 

  

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation expense valuation of inventory warranty liabilities goodwill and other longlived assets investments and accounting for income taxes 

 14 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners 

  

our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary fortiasic which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and tsmc faraday using umc’s foundry “kmicro using tsmc’s foundry and renesas using umc’s foundry manufacture our asics on a purchase order basis and umc and tsmc do not guarantee any capacity and could reject orders from faraday kmicro or renesas or could try to increase pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary or long term inventory shortages of our fortiasic as well as increased costs our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes of products if any of these suppliers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics or specific product models our business would be harmed 

  

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the european union’s “eu” restriction of hazardous substances directive “rohs” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals that originated in the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country known as “conflict minerals” are contained within our products under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted new disclosure requirements for public companies using conflict minerals in their products under these rules we are required to perform due diligence disclose and report our efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals our first conflict minerals report is due by may 31 2014 as a result of these new rules we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any of the conflict minerals that may be used in our products moreover the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products

to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” minerals that can be used in our products there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free if we are not able to meet customer requirements such customers may choose to not purchase our products which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage and may result in the loss of sales and customers and increased component costs may result in lower gross margins 

  

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of central processing units from intel advanced micro devices inc and rminetlogic corporation network chips from broadcom corporation marvell technology group ltd and intel and hard drives from western digital technologies inc the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these events would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a majority of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar although we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts and have periodically entered into cash flow hedges relating to certain operating expenses incurred outside of the united states if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore while substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency 

 16 

risk it does not serve as a hedge to our foreign currencydenominated operating expenses in addition a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability restriction on sales andor impair our ability to compete in international markets 

  

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with us export licensing us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits for orders placed by partners as stocking orders for example we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties and we may not be able to provide support related to appliances shipped pursuant to such orders obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

  

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permittinglicensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

  

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to continue to incur costs related to environmental laws and regulations in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the near future if this exemption is revoked if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

  

 17 

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to governmental entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to governmental entities sales to governmental entities are subject to a number of risks selling to governmental entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

 

 

 

 

the rules and regulations applicable to government sales may also negatively impact sales to nongovernmental entities to date we have had limited traction in sales to us federal government agencies and any future sales to governmental entities is uncertain all of our sales to governmental entities have been made indirectly through our distribution channel governmental entities may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such governmental entity the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

  

false detection of viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

  

our antivirus and our intrusion prevention services may falsely detect viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our antispam and antimalware services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures any such false identification of important files or applications could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

 18 

if our internal network system is compromised by computer hackers public perception of our products and services will be harmed 

  

we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective network security protection because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers although we have not experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems it could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services in addition such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide subscription and support services to our endcustomers if this happens our revenue could decline and our business could suffer 

  

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

  

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products if we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many large endcustomers service provider and governmental entity endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers because of their more complex deployments if we fail to meet the requirements of our larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with enterprises service providers and governmental entities 

  

as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

 19 

   

significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the financial accounting standards board “fasb” standard in addition the standard applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain foreign countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities for example the california franchise tax board is examining our tax returns for 2010 and 2011 we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

although we currently do not have a valuation allowance we may in the future be required to establish one we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

  

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

  

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimated our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations 

  

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

  

in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities if tax authorities challenge the relative mix of us and international income our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

  

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products or technologies and intellectual property such as patents if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or 

 20 

product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues and we may not accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may be dilutive to revenue growth and earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in writeoffs that could be substantial acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property could significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

  

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

  

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest and terrorism 

  

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire a flood or significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products on a timely basis and assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in us missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

  

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications 

 21 

operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

  

our url database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’  expectations 

  

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet could impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations could impair the growth of our business 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

  

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

 22 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products and to improve lead generation our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products and increased lead generation are essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large enterprise service provider and governmental entities markets we have historically had relatively low spending on certain marketing activities and if our marketing programs are not successful in creating market awareness of our company and products our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

  

demand for utm products may be limited by market perception that utm products are inferior to network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of most of our products depend on increased demand for utm products if the utm market fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view utm “allinone” solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that utm products provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform utm solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of the utm product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that utm solutions may be suitable only for small and medium sized businesses because utm lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large enterprise service provider and governmental entity endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with the utm market in general demand for utm products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us or another well known utm vendor exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include networking companies such as cisco and juniper security vendors such as check point mcafee acquired by intel sourcefire acquired by cisco stonesoft acquired by mcafee sonicwall acquired by dell blue coat fireeye and palo alto networks and other point solution security vendors 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

  23 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources such as juniper’s acquisition of netscreen technologies inc intel’s acquisition of mcafee mcafees acquisition of stonesoft check point’s acquisition of nokia corporations’ security appliance business and dell’s acquisition of sonicwall and new competitors may arise pursuant to acquisitions of network security companies or divisions as a result of such acquisitions competition in our market may continue to increase and our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco and juniper offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from time to time legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

  

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license the gnu lesser public license lgpl the bsd license the apache license and others from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they may also assert such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a thirdparty even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement and there are lawsuits claiming patent infringement currently pending as discussed in the section entitled “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes general commercial litigation and could become subject to other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion in addition to the lawsuits described in “legal proceedings” several other nonpracticing patent holding companies have sent us letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 as well as other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these and proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we assess the 

 26 

effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal 2013 as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2013 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2014 or future periods if our internal controls or disclosure controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

  

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

  

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition the increased use of fair value measure financial instruments and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which would have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our reporting obligations 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us for example in fiscal 2013 the closing price of our common stock ranged from 1653 to 2500 

  

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

  

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

  

   

   

  27 

  

   

   

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in june 2012 we received a letter from sri international “sri” claiming that we infringed certain sri patents we settled this matter in december 2013 

we do not currently have any other litigation matters that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to additional various claims complaints and legal actions that arise from time to time in the normal course of business we believe that the possibility that any of these claims complaints or legal proceedings will result in a material loss is remote there can be no assurance that existing or future legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

business overview 

we provide high performance network security solutions which enable broad integrated and high performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the it security infrastructure for enterprises service providers and governmental entities worldwide since inception through december 31 2013  we had shipped over 1400000  appliances via more than 20000  channel partners to more than 184000  endcustomers worldwide including a majority of the 2013  fortune global 100 

our core dcfwutmngfw product line of fortigate physical and virtual appliances ships with a set of security and networking capabilities including firewall vpn application control antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering 

 32 

vulnerability management antispam wireless controller and wan acceleration functionality we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances which range from the fortigate20 designed for small businesses to the fortigate5000 series for large enterprises telecommunications carriers and service providers our dcfwutmngfw solution also includes our fortiguard security subscription services which endcustomers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to intrusion prevention application control antivirus web filtering vulnerability management and antispam functionality included in our appliances endcustomers can also choose to purchase forticare technical support services for our products endcustomers also often use fortimanager and fortianalyzer products in conjunction with a fortigate deployment to provide centralized management analysis and reporting capabilities we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise such as messaging web application firewalls databases protection against denial of service attacks ddos and endpoint security for employee computers and mobile devices sales of these complementary products have grown in recent quarters although these products still represent less than 10 of our total revenue during fiscal 2013  we expanded and enhanced our fortigate dcfwutmngfw and fortiap secure wireless access product lines we also introduced softwarebased virtual appliances for many of our fortigate and fortimanager product lines which help secure the endcustomer’s cloudbased network infrastructures with the same functionality as the traditional physical appliance in their respective product lines 

in fiscal 2013 we completed certain acquisitions   as part of our strategy to expand our product offerings   around  load balancing solutions and add patents to our patent portfolio 

financial highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

we continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position we believe that continued product innovation has strengthened our technology advantage and resulted in market share gains as evidenced by the recent introduction of several noteworthy new fortigate appliance models including new fortigate entrylevel appliances such as the fg60d and fg90d with its wifi counterparts and fg100d the fg200d and fg800c midrange appliance and the fg3600c and fg5001c for large enterprises and service providers during fiscal 2013  we also made a significant investment in sales and marketing to increase brand awareness and grow our global sales force and distribution channels to expand our global presence both geographically and by industry segment as a result we experienced increased deal volumes driven by traction in enterprise data center deployments and large enterprise deals with particular strength in the retail financial and telecommunication sectors 

we remain focused on investing in our sales and research and development resources in order to expand our reach into new highgrowth verticals and emerging markets and meet increasing customer expectations about the quality and functionality of our products as we continue to sell to large customers such as enterprise and service providers while we have experienced some success selling into certain vertical customer segments such as service providers and enterprise we have experienced less traction selling into other verticals such as the us federal government and there can be no assurance we will be successful selling into certain vertical customer segments 

 33 

sales of fortigate products have generally been balanced across entrylevel fortigate20 to 100 series midrange fortigate200 to 800 series and highend fortigate1000 to 5000 series models with each product category representing approximately onethird of fortigate sales with some degree of variability from year to year and between quarters over the threeyear period ended december 31 2013 the percentage of our fortigate related billings from the entrylevel category increased from 32 in fiscal 2012 to 38 in fiscal 2013 while the midrange category decreased from 33  in fiscal 2012 to 29  in fiscal 2013 and the highend category decreased from 35  to 34  

in fiscal 2013 operating expenses increased by 27  compared to fiscal 2012 the increase was primarily driven by our accelerated pace of hiring to support our growth as we continued to invest in expanding our sales coverage developing new products and scaling our customer support organization to meet the needs of our growing customer base this resulted in revenue per employee defined as annual revenue divided by average headcount of 286000 down from 303000 for fiscal 2012 

business model 

our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers who in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to governmentfocused resellers large service providers and major systems integrators who have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements typically fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our physical and virtual appliances we invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and support services and the invoice generally becomes payable within 30 to 90 days we generally recognize product revenue upfront based on the allocated revenue value and defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal subscription and support services contracts we recognize the related services revenue over the service period which is typically one year from the date the endcustomer registers for these services the date on which the services can first be used by the customer although it can be as long as five years sales of new and renewal services increase our deferred revenue balance which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations 

key metrics 

we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies our total deferred revenue increased by 694 million  from 3632 million  as of december 31 2012  to 4326 million  as of december 31 2013  revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations is a useful metric that management identifies as billings billings for services drive deferred revenue which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business and has historically represented a majority of the revenue that we recognize in a typical quarter we ended fiscal 2013  with 8430 million  in cash cash equivalents and investments and have had positive cash flow from operations every fiscal year since 2005 we discuss revenue gross margin and the components of operating income and margin below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss our cash cash equivalents and investments under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue and cash flow from operations are discussed immediately below the following table 

 34 



  

deferred revenue  our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from subscription and support service contracts we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods we define billings as revenue recognized during a period plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combinations the following table reflects the calculation of billings as discussed in the paragraph above for a discussion of the limitations of nongaap financial measures see “—other nongaap financial measures” below 



cash flow from operations and free cash flow  we monitor cash flow from operations as a measure of our overall business performance our cash flow from operations is driven in large part by payments for both new and renewal contracts for subscription and support services monitoring cash flow from operations and free cash flow enables us to analyze our financial performance excluding the noncash effects of certain items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expenses thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business free cash flow an alternative nongaap financial measure of liquidity is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for a discussion of the limitations of nongaap financial measures see “—other nongaap financial measures” below 

 35 



other nongaap financial measures 

to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap including billings and free cash flow discussed above as well as nongaap gross margin nongaap operating income nongaap operating margin nongaap operating expenses and nongaap net income these nongaap financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 

we use these nongaap financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to gaap measures in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance as they help illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in these nongaap financial measures furthermore we use many of these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we also believe that the use of these nongaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry many of which present similar nongaap financial measures to investors 

these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap there are a number of limitations related to the use of these nongaap financial measures versus the nearest gaap equivalent of these financial measures first these nongaap financial measures exclude certain recurring noncash charges such as stockbased compensation expense amortization expense and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets offset by patent settlement income prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation stockbased compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and is an important part of our employees’ overall compensation second the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the expenses if any that our peer companies may exclude when they report their results of operations we compensate for these limitations by providing the nearest gaap equivalents of these nongaap financial measures and describing these gaap equivalents in the section entitled “—results of operations” below 

nongaap gross margin is gross margin as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense amortization expense and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets all of which are noncash charges nongaap operating income is operating income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense amortization expense and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets and the income we received from a patent settlement nongaap operating margin is nongaap operating income divided by revenue the following tables reconcile gaap gross margin operating income and operating margin to nongaap gross margin nongaap operating income and nongaap operating margin for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  

 36 



 37 

nongaap operating expenses represent operating expenses as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense and the income from a patent settlement the following tables reconcile gaap operating expenses to nongaap operating expenses for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  



 38 

nongaap net income represents net income as reported in our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense amortization expense and impairment charges related to certain intangible assets and income from a patent settlement the following tables reconcile gaap net income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations to nongaap net income for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  



 

 

components of operating results 

revenue 

we derive our revenue from sales of our products and subscription and support services revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

  

 

 39 

   

 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

 

 

 

gross profit  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products any excess inventory writeoffs product costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services we believe our overall gross margin for the near term will remain at levels comparable or slightly lower to that achieved in fiscal 2013  

services revenue has historically increased as a percentage of total revenue since inception and this trend has had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher services gross margins compared to product gross margins during fiscal 2013  service margins decreased slightly from fiscal 2012 as we made the decision to invest in support services infrastructure that will allow us to both expand our base of enterprise customers and to support future growth and higher service levels to our existing enterprise customers 

  

operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of cashbased personnel costs such as salaries benefits bonuses and sales commissions they also include noncash charges specifically stockbased compensation expense we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees 

 40 

 

 

 

interest income  interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities municipal bonds certificates of deposit and term deposits and us government and agency debt securities 

other expense net  other expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange and related hedging gains and losses foreign exchange gains and losses relate to foreign currency exchange remeasurement the hedging gains and losses are related to our settled balance sheet hedges 

provision for income taxes  we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than us tax rates and may be subject to us income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the us research and development tax credits withholding taxes nondeductible stockbased compensation expense and adjustments related to our intercompany transfer pricing 

the income tax provision for fiscal 2013  was comprised primarily of domestic income taxes foreign income taxes and withholding taxes our effective tax rate approximates the us federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes research and development tax credits when applicable withholding tax nondeductible stockbased compensation expense foreign income subject to lower tax than the us and adjustments related to intercompany transfer pricing 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation expense valuation of inventory warranty liabilities goodwill and other longlived assets and accounting for income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

 41 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from sales of products including appliances and software and services including subscription support and other services the majority of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product we record revenue from our hardware appliances in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance 

our product revenue also includes software products that may operate on the hardware appliances but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware and are subject to the industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance certain of our software when sold with our appliances is considered essential to the functionality of the appliances and as a result is accounted for as nonsoftware deliverables however this same software if sold separately is accounted for under industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance 

  

when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements such as hardware appliances software customer support services andor professional services we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy in multiple element arrangements where software is morethanincidental revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy when applying the relative selling price method we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of selling price if it exists or thirdparty evidence “tpe” of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable we use our best estimate of selling price besp for that deliverable revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 

  

vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately in establishing vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical standalone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates 

we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately which is generally unavailable 

for our hardware appliances we use besp as our selling price for our support and other services we generally use vsoe as our selling price estimate when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe for our support and other services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels 

we recognize revenue for our software sales based on industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance under industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered and vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements exists if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met

criteria for revenue recognition have been met in the event the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment the sales price is deemed to be not fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the refund or adjustment privileges expire provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

 

for arrangements which include endcustomer acceptance criteria revenue is recognized upon acceptance we recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to endcustomers upon shipment once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met certain distributors that stock our products are granted stock rotation rights limited rights of return as well as rebates for sales of our products the arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not fixed and determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sellthrough substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services which consist of subscriptions andor support subscription services provide access to our antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades maintenance releases and patches telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 

the subscription and support services start on the date the customer registers the appliance the customer is then entitled to service for the stated contractual period beginning on the registration date 

  

we offer certain sales incentives to channel partners we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances additionally in limited circumstances we may permit endcustomers distributors and resellers to return our products subject to varying limitations for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience 

stockbased compensation expense 

employees stock options   we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model for all employee stock options we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term and forfeiture rate any changes in these highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact stockbased compensation expense 

employee stock purchase plan  we estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” using the blackscholes pricing model and is amortized over the requisite service period using the straightline method our espp provides for consecutive sixmonth offering periods and we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of espp shares 

restricted stock units  we account for the fair value of restricted stock units “rsus” awarded to employees and members of our board of directors using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant rsus are payable in shares of our common stock as the periodic vesting requirements are satisfied rsus generally vest over a fouryear period if the employees nonemployees or directors as applicable remain with us for the duration of the vesting period for all rsus we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method 

performance stock units performance stock units “psus” are rsus that contain both servicebased and marketbased vesting conditions psus vest over a specified service period upon the satisfaction of certain marketbased vesting conditions and settle into shares of our common stock upon vesting over a two or threeyear period the fair value of a psu is calculated using the monte carlo simulation model on the date of grant and is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant modified to reflect the impact of the marketbased vesting condition including the estimated payout level based on that condition we do not adjust compensation cost for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the marketbased vesting conditions 

valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of average cost or market after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record additional 

 43 

inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

warranty liabilities 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on hardware products and a 90day warranty on software a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is charged to cost of product revenue based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our gross margin could be adversely affected 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in estimating future tax consequences generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities we provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed more likely than not that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap which defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements the tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 



 45 



fiscal years 2013  and 2012   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased by 817 million  or 15  in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  the americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on an absolute dollar basis and all three regions showed growth on a percentage basis the growth in emea was slightly lower due to a slowdown in the macroeconomic environment in that area product revenue increased by 291 million  or 12  compared to fiscal 2012  the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family due to increased demand across all product categories from our entrylevel and midrange products for smaller enterprises and branch deployments to our highend products for large enterprise and service provider customers services revenue increased by 557 million  or 20  in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base the decrease in ratable and other revenue of 31 million  was primarily due to the 

 46 

continuing decline in amortization of ratable revenue ratable and other revenue for fiscal 2013 included a 28 million sale of previouslyacquired patents as compared to a 37 million sale of previouslyacquired patents in fiscal 2012 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



total gross margin decreased by 18  percentage points in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  as both product and services gross margins declined product gross margin decreased by 35  percentage points in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to a slightly higher mix of sales of entrylevel products particularly several highvolume distributed enterprise retail and education deals sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we also experienced the impact from higher costs related to warrantyrelated costs which increased by 25 million freight costs which increased by 15 million occupancyrelated costs which increased by 11 million and higher excess inventory writeoffs of 07 million services gross margin decreased by 09  percentage points during fiscal 2013 primarily due to our continued investments in our technical support organization to accommodate our expanding customer base and higher service level expectations from our enterprise customers in addition we experienced growth in our professional consulting services which have lower gross margins than our support and subscription businesses cost of services revenue increased by 134 million  primarily due to a 99 million increase in cashbased personnel costs related to headcount increases a 11 million increase in stockbased compensation expense and a 24 million increase in depreciation and other expenses 

operating expenses 

  



research and development 

research and development expense increased by 216 million  or 27  in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase of 117 million in cashbased personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products in addition we incurred higher stockbased compensation expense of 40 million product development expenses such as thirdparty testing and prototypes of 20 million acquisitionrelated costs of 19 million and depreciation and other expenses of 21 million we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization but expect research and development expense as a percentage of revenue to remain at comparable levels in fiscal 2014 

 47 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expense increased by 458 million  or 26  in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase of 256 million in cashbased personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to expand our global footprint in addition we incurred increases in stockbased compensation expense of 67 million marketingrelated expenses of 54 million travel expenses of 39 million depreciation expenses of 21 million and other expenses of 21 million as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses increased as we accelerated the investment in our sales force during fiscal 2013 to support future growth we intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure which are critical to support sustainable growth and expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue to increase in fiscal 2014 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expense increased by 94 million  or 37  in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012  cashbased personnel costs increased by 34 million and stockbased compensation expense increased by 18 million as we continued to increase our headcount in order to support our expanding business in addition we incurred an additional 39 million of legal and accounting fees and 03 million in higher depreciation we expect general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue to remain at comparable levels in fiscal 2014 

interest income and other expense net 

  



the 03 million  increase in interest income in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  was primarily due to interest earned on higher invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other expense net for fiscal 2013  when compared to fiscal 2012 was the result of higher foreign exchange losses 

provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 42  for fiscal 2013  compared with an effective tax rate of 36  for fiscal 2012  the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2013  was comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes as well as the inclusion of stock option benefits and cost allocations which affected the transfer pricing calculations among the us and some of our foreign subsidiaries the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in profits subject to us tax a decrease in stock option benefits and their corresponding impact on the transfer pricing calculations among the us and some of our foreign subsidiaries 

during january 2013 the us federal research and development tax credit was reinstated retroactively to fiscal 2012 the us federal research and development tax credit benefit was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 which was the period of enactment 

beginning with fiscal 2013 we operate under a tax incentive agreement in singapore which is effective through december 31 2023 and may be extended if certain additional requirements are satisfied the tax incentive agreement is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds we did not realize any tax savings from the singapore tax incentives in fiscal 2013 because of net tax losses in that jurisdiction 

 48 

it is our policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as of december 31 2013 we had accrued approximately 10 million for estimated interest related to uncertain tax provisions compared to an accrual of 15 million as of december 31 2012 

the state of california has been conducting an audit of our state income tax returns for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 we do not expect this audit to have a significant detrimental effect on our income tax liability nor have a material impact on our results of operations 

within the next twelve months we do not believe there will be a decrease in uncertain tax benefits that could impact our future effective tax rate 

fiscal years 2012  and 2011   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased by 1001 million or 23 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 the americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on a percentage basis while the emea and apac regions both demonstrated growth of over 20 product revenue increased by 515 million or 26 compared to fiscal 2011 the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family due to increased demand across all product categories from our entrylevel and midrange products for smaller enterprises and branch deployments to our highend products for large enterprise and service provider customers services revenue increased by 538 million or 24 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base the decrease in ratable and other revenue of 53 million was primarily due to the continuing decline in amortization of ratable revenue ratable and other revenue for fiscal 2012 included a 37 million sale of previouslyacquired patents which was an increase from a 26 million sale of previouslyacquired patents in fiscal 2011 excluding the decline in ratable and other revenue product and services revenue combined together increased by 25 compared to fiscal 2011 

 49 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



total gross margin decreased by 14 percentage points in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 as both product and services gross margins declined product gross margin decreased by 06 percentage points in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily related to a higher quantity of midrange products purchased by a large retail customer with lower than average gross margins we also experienced the impact from cost increases related to higher material costs incurred to support higher density storage requirements for our recent release of fortioos 50 our next generation operating system from time to time we have experienced sales of previously reserved inventory during fiscal 2012 we experienced a positive impact to gross margin of 02 percentage points due to the sale of fully reserved inventory compared to a positive impact to gross margin of 04 percentage points in the prior year services gross margin decreased by 24 percentage points during fiscal 2012 primarily due to our continued investments in our technical support organization to accommodate our expanding customer base and higher service level expectations from our enterprise customers in addition we experienced growth in our professional consulting services which have lower gross margins than our support and subscription businesses cost of services revenue increased by 152 million primarily due to an 86 million increase in cashbased personnel costs related to headcount increases a 19 million increase in stockbased compensation expense a 18 million increase in costs associated with extended support contracts a 07 million increase in occupancyrelated costs a 05 million increase in professional services expenses a 05 million increase in travel expenses and a 11 million increase in depreciation and other expenses 

  

operating expenses 

  



research and development expense

 50 

sales and marketing expense 

sales and marketing expense increased by 336 million or 23 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to an increase of 216 million in cashbased personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to expand our global footprint in addition we incurred increases in stockbased compensation expense of 35 million marketingrelated expenses of 32 million depreciation expenses of 16 million occupancyrelated costs of 07 million travel expenses of 10 million supplies expense of 04 million and other expenses of 12 million as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses remained flat as we accelerated the investment in our sales force during the past year to support future growth the increase in sales and marketing expense was partially offset by a 9 yearoveryear increase in the us dollar exchange rate against the euro 

general and administrative expense 

general and administrative expense increased by 35 million or 16 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 stockbased compensation expense increased by 16 million and cashbased personnel costs increased by 07 million in addition we incurred 10 million of litigation settlement expense 

interest income and other expense net 

  



the 15 million increase in interest income in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to interest earned on higher invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other expense net for fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011 was the result of higher foreign exchange losses 

provision for income taxes 

  



our effective tax rate was 36 for fiscal 2012 compared with an effective tax rate of 32 for fiscal 2011 the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2012 was comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes as well as the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries the 2011 effective tax rate was impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries as well as research and development tax credit the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in profits subject to us tax a decrease in stock option benefits and their corresponding impact on the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries and the reduction in us federal research and development tax credit that was reinstated in fiscal 2013 but not recognized in fiscal 2012

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight fiscal quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products subscriptions and services in general a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend has positively impacted sales activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential billings and product revenues which results in lower revenue in the third quarter we generally experience lower revenue in europe compared to the second quarter due to reduced economic activity in europe during the summer months but this may not always be the case similarly our operating income has been affected by these historical trends because operating expenses are relatively fixed in the nearterm although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of a quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has increased sequentially in each quarter except the first quarter of fiscal 2013 which was down due to the seasonality referenced above and macroeconomic challenges experienced in europe product revenue in all of the quarters of fiscal 2013  was higher as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2012  which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales organization and continued product innovation 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services product gross margins were lower in each quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2012 due to a higher mix of sales of entrylevel products product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products services gross margins were lower in the first three quarters of fiscal 2013 compared to the same 

 53 

periods of fiscal 2012 as we made investments in our support organizations at a rate slightly greater than the increase in services revenue 

liquidity and capital resources 

  



liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our operating activities as well as acquisitions capital expenditures and investments in strategic relationships that we have made or may make in the future we expect to spend approximately 150 million related to the improvement of our new corporate headquarters in fiscal 2014 additionally our liquidity may be impacted if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program as of december 31 2013 1611 million  remains available for future share repurchases under this program which will be financed through our available working capital 

as of december 31 2013  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 8430 million  were held for workingcapital purposes and were invested primarily in corporate debt securities commercial paper municipal bonds certificates of deposit and term deposits money market funds and us government and agency debt securities it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital provides liquidity and maximizes return 

as of december 31 2013  889 million  of our cash and investments was held by our international subsidiaries and is therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated while we do not intend to do so should this amount be repatriated it would be subject to us federal income tax which would be partially offset by foreign tax credits we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products historically we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisition activities in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected

in fiscal 2012 our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of investments and to a much lesser extent capital expenditures the 1827 million of cash used by investing activities was due to net purchases of investments of 1594 million purchases of property and equipment of 221 million including 145 million to purchase land and building to support the growth in our business operations and acquisitions for 12 million

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  

  



 56 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper money market funds government and corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  would have resulted in a decrease in our interest income by 05 million 05 million and 04 million respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the us are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar cad to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to hedge balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the creditworthiness of these parties these contracts typically have maturities between one and three months we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts as other expense net in the consolidated statement of operations we recognized an expense of 15 million  in other expense net in fiscal 2013  due to foreign currency transaction losses 

our hedging activities are intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements as our hedging activities are relatively shortterm in nature and are focused on cad longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar against other foreign currencies such as the euro eur british pound gbp and japanese yen jpy could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates for foreign currency exchange rate risk a 10 increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a 17 million change in the value of our foreign currency cash accounts as of december 31 2013 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost 

 57 

of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time third parties may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected we typically indemnify our endcustomers distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties 

seasonality 

for information regarding seasonality see the section entitled “—quarterly results of operations—seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

  

• technological expertise 

  

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

  

• brand recognition 

  

• customer service and support 

  

• sales and distribution capabilities 

  

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

  

• size and financial stability of operations and 

  

• breadth of product line 

our competitors include networking companies such as cisco systems inc “cisco” and juniper networks inc “juniper” security vendors such as check point software technologies ltd “check point” mcafee inc “mcafee” acquired by intel sonicwall inc “sonicwall” acquired by dell inc “dell” and palo alto networks inc “palo alto networks” and other point solution security vendors 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance reliability and breadth our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products in addition our larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2012  our total headcount was 1954  people including contractors we had 599  in research and development 701  in sales and marketing 483  in services and support 39  in manufacturing operations and 132  in a general and administrative capacity as of december 31 2012  our headcount was 469  people in the united states 648  in canada 212  in china 104  in france and 521  in other countries

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results including fluctuations in our key metrics this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

our billings and revenue growth may slow or may not continue 

  

 billings and revenue growth may slow or decline for a number of reasons including a slowdown in demand for our products or services an increase in competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market softness in demand in certain geographies or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue do not appropriately manage our cost structure or encounter unanticipated liabilities any failure by us to maintain profitability and continue our billings and revenue growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

  

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarter’s revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter for example on average over the past eight quarters our shipments during the last two weeks of each quarter accounted for approximately 35 of aggregate billings for each quarter if expected revenue at the end of any quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our logistics partners’ inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received 

near the end of the quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

we rely significantly on revenue from subscription and support services which may decline and because we recognize revenue from subscription and support services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales of subscription and support services are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our subscription and support services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue sales of new or renewal subscription and support services contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers’ spending levels if our sales of new or renewal subscription and support services contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business will suffer in addition in the event significant customers require payment terms for subscription or support services in arrears or for shorter periods of time than annually such as monthly or quarterly this may negatively impact subscription and support billing furthermore we recognize subscription and support services revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically one year but has been as long as five years as a result much of the subscription and support services revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription and support services contracts entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscription or support services contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions or support services is not reflected in full in our statements of operations until future periods our subscription and support services revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal services contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our inventory is complex our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high return products or take advantage of price protection if any is available to the particular partner or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture certain products or ship products increases for any reason this could result in inventory shortfalls management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell 

  

in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have experienced inventory shortages in the past for instance based on more demand for certain products than we had forecasted if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our channel partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on thirdparty channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

  

substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners which include distributors and resellers we depend upon our channel partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

  

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements they may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products they may also have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot assure you that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners or that existing channel partners will continue to perform the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

  

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to larger endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large enterprises service providers and governmental entities sales to enterprises service providers and governmental entities involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smalltomidsized entities these risks include 

  

   

   

 

   

large enterprises service providers and governmental entities often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases over 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to larger endcustomers due to the lengthy nature the size and scope and stringent requirements of these evaluations we typically provide evaluation products to these customers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales if we are unsuccessful in converting these evaluations into sales we may experience an increased inventory of used products and potentially increased writeoffs in addition product purchases by enterprises service providers and governmental entities are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays finally enterprises service providers and governmental entities typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers if sales expected from a large endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

the average sales prices of our products may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the average sales prices for our products may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts we offer a change in our mix of products anticipation of the introduction of new products or promotional programs competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or may bundle them with other products additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those 

countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the average sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

actual possible or perceived defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach or misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

  

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic or cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortigate appliances and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual possible or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products and services we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized thirdparty any actual possible or perceived defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our business and operations have experienced significant growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

we have a high volume business that has grown over the last several years we rely heavily on information technology systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews however we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions like electronic data interchange which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on the manual processing of emails internally and from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a majority of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter a significant interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that quarter to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure operating and administrative systems and controls and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner for example we are in the early stages of considering upgrading our enterprise resource planning system and any such 

change may cause disruption and additional cost in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses our productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations 

  

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation expense valuation of inventory warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering and sales may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we have experienced turnover in our managementlevel personnel including the recent resignation of our vice president of sales for americas none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highlyskilled personnel is frequently intense especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel the san francisco bay area vancouver canada and beijing china we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information 

  

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations ken goldman our former vice president and chief financial officer resigned from his position in october 2012 the loss of services of other members of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder president and chief executive officer and michael xie our cofounder vice president of engineering and chief technology officer and any of our senior sales leaders could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives in addition key personnel may be distracted by activities unrelated to our business the loss of the services or distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global economic conditions weak economic conditions in certain geographies or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth 

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers and thirdparty manufacturing cost increases could result in lower gross margins 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners 

  

our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner furthermore manufacturing cost increases for any reason could result in lower gross margins 

  

our proprietary fortiasic which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and tsmc faraday technology corporation using umc’s foundry kmicro using tsmc’s foundry and renesas using umc’s foundry manufacture our asics on a purchase order basis and these foundries do not guarantee any capacity and could reject orders from faraday kmicro or renesas or try to increase pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary or long term inventory shortages of our fortiasic as well as increased costs our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes of products if any of these suppliers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics or specific product models our business would be harmed 

  

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the european union’s “eu” restriction of hazardous substances directive “rohs” and other similar laws it also exposes us to the risk that certain minerals and metals that originated in the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country known as “conflict minerals” are contained within our products under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the sec adopted new disclosure requirements for public companies using conflict minerals in their products under these rules we are required to perform due diligence disclose and report our efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals as a result of these new rules we expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any of the conflict minerals that may be used in our products moreover the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage and may result in the loss of sales and customers and increased component costs may result in lower gross margins 

  

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of central processing units from intel advanced micro devices inc rminetlogic corporation and via technologies inc network chips from broadcom marvell and intel and hard drives from western digital technologies inc the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and other factors our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations in addition increased component costs could result in lower gross margins 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a majority of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar “cad”  for example during the second and third quarters of 2011 we were affected by the weakening of the us dollar against the cad and the euro “eur” which caused our operating expenses to increase although we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts and have periodically entered into cash flow hedges relating to certain operating expenses incurred outside of the united states if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

product and service sales may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

  

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with us export licensing us customs regulations and import regulations us economic sanctions and other countries’ import and export laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

  

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permittinglicensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

  

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to incur more of these costs in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the near future if this exemption is revoked if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

  

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to governmental entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to governmental entities sales to governmental entities are subject to a number of risks selling to governmental entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a sale 

government demand sales and payment for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as 

 

 

 

 

the rules and regulations applicable to government sales may also negatively impact sales to nongovernmental entities to date we have had limited traction in sales to us federal government agencies and any future sales to governmental entities is uncertain all of our sales to governmental entities have been made indirectly through our distribution channel governmental entities may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such governmental entity the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

  

false detection of viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

  

our antivirus and our intrusion prevention services may falsely detect viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our antispam and antispyware services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures any such false identification of important files or applications could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

if our internal network system is compromised by computer hackers public perception of our products and services will be harmed 

  

we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective network security protection because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers although we have not experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems it could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services in addition such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide subscription and support services to our endcustomers if this happens our revenue could decline and our business could suffer 

  

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

  

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products if we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many enterprise service provider and governmental entity endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller end 

customers if we fail to meet the requirements of the larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with larger endcustomers 

  

as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the financial accounting standards board “fasb” standard in addition the standard applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain foreign countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

although we currently do not have a valuation allowance we may in the future be required to establish one we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

  

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

  

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimated our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations 

  

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

  

in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities if tax authorities challenge the relative mix of us and international income our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

  

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products or technologies and intellectual property such as patents if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may not be accretive to earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in writeoffs that could be substantial acquisitions during a quarter may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations for that period or future periods compared to the results that we have previously forecasted or achieved further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property could significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

  

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur 

significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

  

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest and terrorism 

  

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire a flood or significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors suppliers or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products on a timely basis and assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

  

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

  

our url database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers ’  expectations 

  

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious 

code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet will impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn will harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our customers’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations will impair the growth of our business 

  

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

  

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow 

increased market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large enterprise service provider and governmental entities markets we have historically had relatively low spending on certain marketing activities and if our marketing programs are not successful in creating market awareness of our company and products our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

  

demand for utm products may be limited by market perception that utm products are inferior to network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of most of our products depend on increased demand for utm products if the utm market fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view utm “allinone” solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that utm products provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform utm solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of the utm product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that utm solutions may be suitable only for small and medium sized businesses because utm lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large enterprise service provider and governmental entity endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with the utm market in general demand for utm products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us or another well known utm vendor exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include networking companies such as cisco and juniper security vendors such as check point mcafee acquired by intel sonicwall acquired by dell and palo alto networks and other point solution security vendors 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to 

accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources such as juniper’s acquisition of netscreen technologies inc intel’s acquisition of mcafee check point’s acquisition of nokia corporations’ security appliance business and dell’s acquisition of sonicwall as a result of such acquisitions our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco and juniper offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents and may make it more difficult and costly to prosecute patent applications as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from time to time legal action by us 

may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

  

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license the gnu lesser public license lgpl the bsd license the apache license and others from time to time there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they may also assert such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a thirdparty even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement and there are lawsuits claiming patent infringement currently pending as discussed in the section entitled “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k we are also subject to other litigation in addition to patent infringement claims such as employmentrelated litigation and disputes general commercial litigation and other forms of litigation and disputes including stockholder litigation if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be 

materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products litigation with or without merit could negatively impact our business reputation and sales in a material fashion in addition to the lawsuits described in “legal proceedings” several other nonpracticing patent holding companies have sent us letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 as well as other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these and proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal 2012  as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2012  our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2013  or future periods if our internal controls or disclosure controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management’s time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

  

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

  

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to the increased use of fair value measure financial instruments and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business if we do not ensure that our systems and processes are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which would have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our reporting obligations 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us for example in the year ended december 31 2012 the price of our common stock ranged from 1781 to 2844 

  

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

  

our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business 

  

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months if we need to raise additional funds in the future we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the pershare value of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the stockholders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms we may not be able to among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

business overview 

we provide network security solutions which enable broad integrated and high performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the it security infrastructure for enterprises service providers and governmental entities worldwide since inception through december 31 2012  we had shipped over 1100000  appliances via more than 10000  channel partners to more than 150000  endcustomers worldwide including a majority of the 2012  fortune global 100 

our core utmngfw product line of fortigate physical and virtual appliances ships with a set of security and networking capabilities including firewall vpn application control antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering antispam and wan acceleration functionality we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances which range from the fortigate20 designed for small businesses to the fortigate5000 series for large enterprises telecommunications carriers and service providers our utmngfw solution also includes our fortiguard security subscription services which endcustomers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to intrusion prevention application control antivirus web filtering vulnerability management and antispam functionality included in our appliances endcustomers can also choose to purchase forticare technical support services for our products endcustomers also often use fortimanager and fortianalyzer products in conjunction with a fortigate deployment to provide centralized management analysis and reporting capabilities we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise such as messaging web application firewalls databases protection against denial of service attacks ddos and endpoint security for employee computers and mobile devices sales of these complementary products have grown in recent quarters although these products still represent less than 10 of our total revenue during fiscal  2012 we announced our new fortios 50 operating system fortios 50 is our fifth generation security operating system and this release brings more than 150 new features to our fortigate product line in addition we announced version 50 operating systems for our fortimanager fortianalyzer and forticlient products to address the need for increasingly sophisticated management and analysis of the network infrastructure and endpoint devices in various environments during fiscal 2012 we also announced our new fortiasicsoc2 processor fortiasicsoc2 is our secondgeneration processor that combines general purpose processing power with fortinet ’ s custom technology to provide hardwareaccelerated network security performance for our fortigate appliances it provides more than double the general processing capacity than its predecessor during fiscal 2012  we expanded and enhanced our fortigate utmngfw and fortiap secure wireless access product lines we also introduced softwarebased virtual appliances for many 

of our fortigate and fortimanager product lines which help secure the endcustomer’s cloudbased network infrastructures with the same functionality as the traditional physical appliance in their respective product lines 

financial highlights 

 

 

 

 

fiscal 2012 was our third full year as a public company following our initial public offering in november 2009 we believe the greater visibility and brand recognition derived from being a public company combined with success in selling to enterprise and service provider customers and new product introductions served as contributors to the growth in our business during fiscal 2012 

we continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position and believe continued product innovation has strengthened our technology advantage and resulted in market share gains as evidenced by the recent introduction of several noteworthy new fortigate appliance models such as the fg100d fg800c fg3240c and fg5101c during fiscal 2012  we also made a significant investment in sales and marketing to increase brand awareness and grow our global sales force and distribution channels to grow our global presence both geographically and by industry segment as a result we experienced increased deal volumes driven by traction in enterprise data center deployments and large enterprise deals with particular strength in the retail financial and telecommunication sectors 

the number of deals involving sales greater than 100000 was 718  in fiscal 2012 compared to 560  in fiscal 2011 the number of deals involving sales greater than 250000 was 241  in fiscal 2012 compared to 167  in fiscal 2011 the number of deals of involving sales greater than 500000 was 81  in fiscal 2012 compared to 57  in fiscal 2011 we expect some variability in this metric and remain focused on investing in our sales and research and development resources in order to expand our reach into new highgrowth verticals and emerging markets and meet increasing customer expectations about the quality and functionality of our products as we continue to sell to large customers such as enterprise and service providers while we have experienced some success selling into certain vertical customer segments such as service providers and enterprise we have experienced less traction selling into other verticals such as the us federal government and there can be no assurance we will be successful selling into certain vertical customer segments 

sales of fortigate products have generally been balanced across entrylevel fortigate20 to 100 series midrange fortigate200 to 800 series and highend fortigate1000 to 5000 series models with each product category representing approximately onethird of fortigate sales with some degree of variability from year to year and between quarters over the threeyear period ended december 31 2012 the percentage of our fortigate related billings from the midrange category increased from 31  in fiscal 2011 to 33  in fiscal 2012 while the highend category decreased from 37  to 35  while the entrylevel category remained flat year over year see “—key metrics” below for more information on billings and “—other nongaap financial measures” for a discussion of the limitations of nongaap financial measures 

in fiscal 2012 operating expenses increased by 24  compared to fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily driven by additional headcount to support our growth as we continued to invest in the development of new products and expand our sales coverage we also incurred 13 million of litigation settlement expense in fiscal 2012 of this amount we recorded 10 million as a general and administrative expense and 03 million as a sales and marketing expense these increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to fiscal 2011 we also experienced improvements in productivity and efficiencies in our overall headcount as our annualized fiscal 2012 revenue per employee defined as annual revenue divided by average headcount reached 303000 up from 297000 for fiscal 2011 headcount increased to 1954  as of december 31 2012 from 1583  as of december 31 2011 our accelerated pace of hiring continued in fiscal 2012 particularly in support sales and marketing and research and development 

our business model 

our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers who in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to governmentfocused resellers large service providers and major systems integrators who have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements typically fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our physical and virtual appliances we invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and support services and the invoice generally becomes payable within 30 to 90 days we generally recognize product revenue upfront based on the allocated revenue value and defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal subscription and support services contracts we recognize the related services revenue over the service period which is typically one year from the date the endcustomer registers for these services the date on which the services can first be used by the customer although it can be as long as five years sales of new and renewal services increase our deferred revenue balance which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations 

key metrics 

we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies our total deferred revenue increased by 684 million  from 2948 million  as of december 31 2011  to 3632 million  as of december 31 2012  revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period is a useful metric that management identifies as billings billings for services drive deferred revenue which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business and has historically represented a majority of the revenue that we recognize in a typical quarter we ended fiscal 2012  with 7396 million  in cash cash equivalents and investments and have had positive cash flow from operations every fiscal year since 2005 we discuss revenue gross margin and the components of operating income and margin below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss our cash cash equivalents and investments under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue and cash flow from operations are discussed immediately below the following table 

  



  

deferred revenue  our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from subscription and support service contracts we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods we define billings as revenue recognized during a period plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period the following table reflects the calculation of billings as discussed in the paragraph above for a discussion of the limitations of nongaap financial measures see “—other nongaap financial measures” below 



cash flow from operations  we monitor cash flow from operations as a measure of our overall business performance our cash flow from operations is driven in large part by advance payments for both new and renewal contracts for subscription and support services consistent with our billings for the period monitoring cash flow from operations and free cash flow enables us to analyze our financial performance excluding the noncash effects of certain items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expenses thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business free cash flow an alternative nongaap financial measure of liquidity is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for a discussion of the limitations of nongaap financial measures see “—other nongaap financial measures” below 



other nongaap financial measures 

to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” we consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with us gaap including billings and free cash flow discussed above as well as nongaap gross margin nongaap operating income nongaap operating margin nongaap operating expenses and nongaap net income these nongaap financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 

we use these nongaap financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to gaap measures in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance as they help illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in these nongaap financial measures furthermore we use many of these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we also believe that the use of these nongaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry many of which present similar nongaap financial measures to investors 

these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap there are a number of limitations related to the use of these nongaap financial measures versus the nearest gaap equivalent of these financial measures first these nongaap financial measures exclude certain recurring noncash charges such as stockbased compensation expense offset by patent settlement income stockbased compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and is an important part of our employees’ overall compensation second the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the expenses if any that our peer companies may exclude when they report their results of operations we compensate for these limitations by providing the nearest gaap equivalents of these nongaap financial measures and describing these gaap equivalents in the section entitled “—results of operations” below 

nongaap gross margin is gross margin as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense which is a noncash charge nongaap operating income is operating income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense and the income we received from a patent settlement nongaap operating margin is nongaap operating income divided by revenue the following tables reconcile gaap gross margin operating income and operating margin to nongaap gross margin nongaap operating income and nongaap operating margin for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  



nongaap operating expenses exclude the impact of stockbased compensation expense and the income from a patent settlement the following tables reconcile gaap operating expenses to nongaap operating expenses for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010  



nongaap net income is net income as reported in our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense and income from a patent settlement the following tables reconcile gaap net income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations to nongaap net income for fiscal 2012  2011  and 2010

components of operating results 

revenue 

we derive our revenue from sales of our products and subscription and support services in fiscal 2011 we recognized our revenue in accordance with the new revenue recognition accounting guidance which is discussed in further detail in “—critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below according to the new accounting standards revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

  

 

   

 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

 39 

and obsolete inventory royalty payments amortization and any impairment of applicable acquired intangible assets warranty costs shipping and allocated facilities costs stockbased compensation expense and personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control personnel costs include cashbased personnel costs such as salaries benefits and bonuses royalties reflect amounts related to the litigation with trend micro incorporated which was settled in december 2011 

 

 

gross profit  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products any excess inventory writeoffs product costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services we believe our overall gross margin for the near term will remain at levels comparable to that achieved in fiscal 2012  

services revenue has historically increased as a percentage of total revenue since inception and this trend has had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher services gross margins compared to product gross margins during fiscal 2012 service margins decreased slightly from fiscal 2011 as we made the decision to invest in support services infrastructure that will allow us to both expand our base of enterprise customers and to support future growth and higher service levels to our existing enterprise customers 

  

operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of cashbased personnel costs such as salaries benefits bonuses and sales commissions they also include noncash charges specifically stockbased compensation expense we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees 

 

 

 

interest income  interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities municipal bonds certificates of deposit and term deposits and us government and agency debt securities 

other expense net  other expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange and related hedging gains and losses foreign exchange gains and losses relate to foreign currency exchange remeasurement the hedging gains and losses are related to our settled balance sheet hedges 

provision for income taxes  we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than us tax rates and may be subject to us income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the us research and development tax credits withholding taxes nondeductible stockbased compensation expense and adjustments related to our intercompany transfer pricing 

the income tax provision for fiscal 2012  was comprised primarily of domestic income taxes foreign income taxes and withholding taxes our effective tax rate approximates the us federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes research and development tax credits when applicable withholding tax nondeductible stockbased compensation expense foreign income subject to lower tax than the us and adjustments related to intercompany transfer pricing 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation expense valuation of inventory warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

in october 2009 the fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to provide guidance on how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and eliminates the use of the residual method the new accounting standards also require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method the new accounting standards establish a hierarchy of evidence to determine the standalone selling price of a deliverable based on vsoe third party evidence “tpe” and the besp if vsoe is available it would be used to determine the selling price of a deliverable if vsoe is not available the entity would determine whether tpe is available if so tpe must be used to determine the selling price if tpe is not available then the besp would be used the new accounting standards amended industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions to exclude from its scope tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality 

  

this guidance did not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions most nonsoftware products and services qualify as separate units of accounting because they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and our revenue arrangements generally do not include a right of return relative to delivered products 

  

the majority of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product therefore our hardware appliances are considered nonsoftware deliverables and are no longer within the scope of industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance 

our product revenue also includes software products that may operate on the hardware appliances but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware and continue to be subject to the industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance certain of our software when sold with our appliances is considered essential to its functionality and as a result is no longer accounted for under industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance however this same software if sold separately is accounted for under industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance 

  

for all transactions originating or materially modified after december 31 2010 we recognize revenue in accordance with the new accounting standards certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may continue to have software deliverables that are subject to industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance along with nonsoftware deliverables that are subject to the new accounting standards when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements such as hardware appliances software customer support services andor professional services we allocate revenue to each element based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy in multiple element arrangements where software is morethanincidental revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy in the new revenue recognition accounting guidance 

  

vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical standalone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates in addition we consider major segments geographies customer classifications and other variables in determining vsoe 

we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a standalone basis 

for our hardware appliances we use besp as our selling price for our support and other services we generally use vsoe as our selling price when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe for our support and other services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels we review our besp estimates on a quarterly basis to coincide with our vsoe review process 

we recognize revenue for our software sales based on industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance under industryspecific software revenue recognition guidance we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered and vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements exists if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period 

we derive revenue from sales of products including appliances and software and services including subscription support and other services our appliances include operating system software that is integrated into the appliance hardware and is deemed essential to its functionality as a result we account for revenue in accordance with the new revenue recognition accounting guidance and all related interpretations 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

  

   

   

 

   

for arrangements which include endcustomer acceptance criteria revenue is recognized upon acceptance we recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to endcustomers upon shipment once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met certain distributors that stock our products are granted stock rotation rights as well as rebates for sales of our products the arrangement fee for this group of distributors is not fixed and determinable when products are shipped and revenue is therefore deferred and recognized upon sellthrough substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services which consist of subscriptions andor support subscription services provide access to our antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades maintenance releases and patches telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 

the subscription and support services start on the date the customer registers the appliance the customer is then entitled to service for the stated contractual period beginning on the registration date 

  

we offer certain sales incentives to channel partners we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances additionally in limited circumstances we may permit endcustomers distributors and resellers to return our products subject to varying limitations for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience 

as of december 31 2012  our allowance for sales returns was 23 million  compared to 24 million  as of december 31 2011  if our allowance for sales returns had increased by 10 or 02 million  our net revenue would have decreased by 02 million  in fiscal 2012  

stockbased compensation expense 

employees stock options   we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model for all employee stock options we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term and forfeiture rate any changes in these highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact stockbased compensation expense 

employee stock purchase plan  we estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our employee stock purchase plan “espp” using the blackscholes pricing model our espp provides for consecutive sixmonth offering periods and we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of espp shares 

restricted stock units  we account for the fair value of restricted stock units “rsus” awarded to employees and members of our board of directors using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant rsus are payable in shares of our common stock as the periodic vesting requirements are satisfied rsus will vest over a fouryear period from the date of grant if the employees nonemployees or directors as applicable remain with us for the duration of the vesting period 

valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record additional inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

warranty liabilities 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on hardware products and a 90day warranty on software a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is charged to cost of product revenue based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our gross margin could be adversely affected 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in estimating future tax consequences generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities we provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed more likely than not that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with us gaap which defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements the tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible we continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted 

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 





fiscal years 2012  and 2011   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased by 1001 million  or 23  in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  the americas region contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on a percentage basis while the emea and apac regions both demonstrated growth of over 20 product revenue increased by 515 million  or 26  compared to fiscal 2011  the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume in our fortigate product family due to increased demand across all product categories from our entrylevel and midrange products for smaller enterprises and branch deployments to our highend products for large enterprise and service provider customers services revenue increased by 538 million  or 24  in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base the decrease in ratable and other revenue of 53 million  was primarily due to the continuing decline in amortization of ratable revenue ratable and other revenue for fiscal 

2012 included a 37 million sale of previouslyacquired patents which was an increase from a 26 million sale of previouslyacquired patents in fiscal 2011 excluding the decline in ratable and other revenue product and services revenue combined together increased by 25 compared to fiscal 2011

total gross margin decreased by 14  percentage points in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  as both product and services gross margins declined product gross margin decreased by 06  percentage points in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  primarily related to a higher quantity of midrange products purchased by a large retail customer with lower than average gross margins we also experienced the impact from cost increases related to higher material costs incurred to support higher density storage requirements for our recent release of fortioos 50 our next generation operating system from time to time we have experienced sales of previously reserved inventory during fiscal 2012 we experienced a positive impact to gross margin of 02 percentage points due to the sale of fully reserved inventory compared to a positive impact to gross margin of 04 percentage points in the prior year services gross margin decreased by 24  percentage points during fiscal 2012 primarily due to our continued investments in our technical support organization to accommodate our expanding customer base and higher service level expectations from our enterprise customers in addition we experienced growth in our professional consulting services which have lower gross margins than our support and subscription businesses cost of services revenue increased by 152 million  primarily due to an 86 million increase in cashbased personnel costs related to headcount increases a 19 million increase in stockbased compensation expense a 18 million increase in costs associated with extended support contracts a 07 million increase in occupancyrelated costs a 05 million increase in professional services expenses a 05 million increase in travel expenses and a 11 million increase in depreciation and other expenses 

operating expenses 

  



research and development expense 

research and development expense increased by 175 million  or 28  in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to an increase of 93 million in cashbased personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support the development of new products and continued enhancements of our existing products in addition we incurred higher stock 

based compensation expense of 45 million product development expenses of 12 million depreciation expense of 09 million supplies expense of 06 million occupancyrelated costs of 04 million and other expenses of 05 million the increase in research and development expense was partially offset by a 2 yearoveryear increase in the us dollar exchange rate against the cad as a majority of our research and development personnel are located in canada we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization but expect research and development expense as a percentage of revenue to remain at comparable levels in fiscal 2013 

sales and marketing expense 

sales and marketing expense increased by 336 million  or 23  in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to an increase of 216 million in cashbased personnel costs as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to expand our global footprint in addition we incurred increases in stockbased compensation expense of 35 million marketingrelated expenses of 32 million depreciation expenses of 16 million occupancyrelated costs of 07 million travel expenses of 10 million supplies expense of 04 million and other expenses of 12 million as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses remained flat as we accelerated the investment in our sales force during the past year to support future growth the increase in sales and marketing expense was partially offset by a 9 yearoveryear increase in the us dollar exchange rate against the euro we intend to continue to make investments in our sales resources and infrastructure which are critical to support sustainable growth but expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue to remain at comparable levels in fiscal 2013 

general and administrative expense 

general and administrative expense increased by 35 million  or 16  in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011  stockbased compensation expense increased by 16 million and cashbased personnel costs increased by 07 million in addition we incurred 10 million of litigation settlement expense we expect general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue to remain at comparable levels in fiscal 2013 

interest income and other expense net 

  



the 15 million  increase in interest income in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  was primarily due to interest earned on higher invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other expense net for fiscal 2012  when compared to fiscal 2011 was the result of higher foreign exchange losses 

provision for income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 36  for fiscal 2012  compared with an effective tax rate of 32  for fiscal 2011  the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2012  was comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes as well as the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries the 2011 effective tax rate was impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries as well as research and development tax credit the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in profits subject to us tax a decrease in stock option benefits and their corresponding impact on the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries and the reduction in us federal research and development tax credit that was reinstated in fiscal 2013 but not recognized in fiscal 2012 

during january 2013 the us federal research and development tax credit was reinstated retroactively to fiscal 2012 the us federal research and development tax credit benefit will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 which is the period of enactment the state of california will be conducting an audit of our income tax returns for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 we do not currently expect a material impact on our results of operations to arise from this audit that would have a detrimental impact on our income tax liability 

fiscal years 2011  and 2010   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased by 1089 million or 34 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules described in note 1of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k contributed to 200 million of the increase primarily with respect to product revenue the americas and apac regions contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on a percentage basis product revenue increased by 623 million or 46 compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume and higher average sales prices in our fortigate product family due to increased demand for our highend products from enterprise and service provider customers the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition rules referenced above also contributed to the increase in product revenue services revenue increased by 482 million or 28 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to the recognition of revenue from our increased focus on contract renewals and our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base ratable and other revenue was 42 million lower due to the impact of no longer deferring ratable revenue as a result of the abovementioned adoption of new revenue recognition rules offset by a 26 million sale of previouslyacquired patents 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



total gross margin remained consistent in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 product gross margin increased by 13 percentage points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a greater mix of our highend products from time to time we have experienced sales of previously reserved inventory during fiscal 2011 we experienced a positive impact of 04 percentage points in our product gross margin due to the sale of fully reserved inventory compared to a positive impact of 07 percentage points in fiscal 2010 services gross margin was relatively flat as we continued to make investments in our support professional services and fortiguard global security organizations at a rate slightly greater than the increase in revenue in order to improve service capabilities cost of services revenue increased by 85 million primarily due to a 61 million increase in cashbased personnel costs related to headcount increases a 09 million increase in stockbased compensation expense a 08 million increase in warranty and other expenses and a 07 million increase in professional services costs ratable and other revenue gross margin increased by 51 percentage points as a result of a 26 million sale of previouslyacquired patents during fiscal 2011 which had a direct positive impact to gross margins 

operating expenses 

  



research and development expense 

research and development expense increased by 138 million or 28 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in cashbased personnel costs and stockbased compensation expense cashbased personnel costs increased by 97 million as a result of increased headcount to support continued enhancements of our existing products stockbased compensation expense increased by 24 million primarily due to the increase in headcount and stock price and the introduction of the espp in fiscal 2011 in addition we incurred increases in product development expenses such as nonrecurring engineering testing and certifications of 08 million depreciation expense of 06 million occupancyrelated costs of 02 million and other expenses of 01 million the increase in the cad exchange rate against the us dollar also significantly contributed to the increase in research and development expenses by 20 million 

sales and marketing expense 

sales and marketing expense increased by 336 million or 30 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to expand our global footprint cashbased personnel costs increased by 

213 million primarily as a result of increased headcount stockbased compensation expense increased by 55 million primarily due to the increase in headcount and stock price and the introduction of the espp in fiscal 2011 in addition we incurred increases in marketingrelated expenses of 29 million and travel of 15 million to support our overall revenue growth of 34 we also had a combined 16 million increase in depreciation and other expenses and a 08 million increase in occupancyrelated costs as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased by 09 percentage points due to the leverage achieved from the investment in our sales force in fiscal 2011 as evidenced by revenue growth of 34 exceeding sales and marketing expenses growth of 30 

general and administrative expense 

in fiscal 2011 general and administrative expense decreased by 04 million or 2 compared to fiscal 2010 cashbased personnel costs increased by 15 million stockbased compensation expense increased by 09 million and occupancyrelated costs and other expenses increased by a combined 01 million partially offset by 20 million in royalties received from a patent settlement and a 10 million decrease in legal expenses compared to fiscal 2010 

interest income and other expense net 

  



the 17 million increase in interest income in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to interest earned on higher invested balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other expense net for fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of lower foreign exchange losses in fiscal 2011 

provision for income taxes 

  



our effective tax rate was 32 for fiscal 2011 compared with an effective tax rate of 27 for fiscal 2010 the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2011 was comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes the 2010 effective tax rate was impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries as well as the reinstated us federal research and development tax credit the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in profits subject to us tax 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight fiscal quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products subscriptions and services in general a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend has positively impacted sales activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential billings and product revenues which results in lower product revenue in the third quarter we generally experience lower revenue in europe compared to the second quarter due to reduced economic activity in europe during the summer months but this may not always be the case similarly our gross margins and operating income have been affected by these historical trends because expenses are relatively fixed in the nearterm although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of a quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

our total quarterly revenue over the past eight quarters has increased sequentially in each quarter except the first quarter of fiscal 2012 which was down slightly product revenue in all of the quarters of fiscal 2012  was higher as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2011  which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales organization continued product innovation and improvements in overall corporate it spending 



quarterly gross margin trend 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products services gross margins were lower in each quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2011 as we made investments in our support organizations at a rate slightly greater than the increase in services revenue 



  



liquidity and capital resources 

  



as of december 31 2012  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 7396 million  were held for workingcapital purposes and were invested primarily in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities municipal bonds certificates of deposit and term deposits and us government and agency debt securities as of december 31 2012 266 million  of our cash was held by our international subsidiaries and is therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated while we do not intend to do so should this amount be repatriated it would be subject to us federal income tax which would be partially offset by foreign tax credits we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper money market funds government and corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2012  2011  and 2010  would have resulted in a decrease in our interest income of 05 million 04 million and 02 million respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the us are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the cad to help protect against significant fluctuations in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to hedge balance sheet items denominated in cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the creditworthiness of these parties these contracts typically have maturities between one and three months we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts as other expense net in the consolidated statement of operations we recognized an expense of 05 million  in other expense net in fiscal 2012  due to foreign currency transaction losses 

our hedging activities are intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements as our hedging activities are relatively shortterm in nature longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar versus the cad euro eur british pound gbp and japanese yen jpy could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

we have no longterm contracts related to the manufacturing of our asics or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms 

for information regarding the geographical disbursement of our longlived assets see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

research and development 

we focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and systems and adding new features to existing products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that are or are expected to be needed by our endcustomers our success in designing developing manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors including the identification of market demand for new products product selection timely implementation of product design and development product performance effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2011  our research and development organization had headcount of 497 people predominantly in 

canada the united states and china our research and development expense was 636 million  in fiscal 2011 498 million  in fiscal 2010 and 422 million  in fiscal 2009 

intellectual property 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology as of december 31 2011  we had 76 issued us patents 12 issued chinese patents 1 issued japanese patent 96 patent applications pending for examination in the united states and 20 patent applications pending for examination in china we also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in particular leading companies in the networking industry have extensive patent portfolios from timetotime third parties including certain of these leading companies have asserted and may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected we typically indemnify our endcustomers distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

  

• technological expertise 

  

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

  

• brand recognition 

  

• customer service and support 

  

• sales and distribution capabilities 

  

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

  

• size and financial stability of operations and 

  

• breadth of product line 

our competitors include networking companies such as cisco systems inc juniper networks inc and security vendors such as check point software technologies ltd mcafee inc acquired by intel corporation and sonicwall inc acquired by thoma bravo palo alto networks and other point solution security vendors 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance reliability and breadth our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and 

have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality 

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products in addition our larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2011  our total headcount was 1583 people including payrolled contractors we had 497 in research and development 593 in sales and marketing 352 in services and support 29 in manufacturing operations and 112 in a general and administrative capacity as of december 31 2011  our headcount was 387 people in the united states 555 in canada 89 in france 192 in china and 360 in other countries 

none of our us employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us however our employees in france spain and italy are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose some or all of your investment 

risks related to our business   

our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 

  

 8 

  

   

 

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant 

fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results including fluctuations in our key metrics this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

our billings and revenue growth may slow or may not continue 

  

we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase billings revenue or deferred revenue do not appropriately manage our cost structure or encounter unanticipated liabilities billings and revenue growth may slow or decline for a number of reasons including a slow down in demand for our products or services an increase in competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market softness in demand in certain geographies or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities any failure by us to maintain profitability and continue our billings and revenue growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

  

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas we have historically received a substantial portion of each quarters sales orders and generated a substantial portion of each quarters revenue during the last two weeks of the quarter if expected revenue at the end of any quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize or our logistics partners inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

we rely significantly on revenue from subscription and support services which may decline and because we recognize revenue from subscriptions and support services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our services revenue has historically accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue sales of new or renewal subscription and services contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including endcustomers level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers spending levels if our sales of new or renewal subscription and services contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business will suffer in addition we recognize subscription and service revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically one year but has been as long as five years as a result much of the revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription and services contracts entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscription or service contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions or services is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods our subscription and service revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal service contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period furthermore increases in the average term of services contracts would result in revenue for services contracts being recognized over longer periods of time 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high return product or take advantage of price protection if any or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture certain products or ship products increases for any reason this could result in inventory shortfalls management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell 

  

in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain 

inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors products that are readily available for example we experienced inventory shortages in the third quarter of 2011 based largely on more demand for certain products than we had forecast if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our distribution partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on thirdparty channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

  

substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners which include distributors and resellers we depend upon our channel partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may adversely impact our sales and operating results 

  

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements they may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products they may have incentives to promote our competitors products to the detriment of our own they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot assure you that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to optimize our channel partner model or fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

  

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to larger endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large enterprises service providers and governmental entities sales to enterprises service providers and governmental entities involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smalltomidsized entities these risks include 

  

   

   

 

   

large enterprises service providers and governmental entities often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases over 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to larger endcustomers due to the lengthy nature the size and scope and stringent requirements of these evaluations we typically provide evaluation products to these customers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being 

successful in producing any sales if we are unsuccessful in converting these evaluations into sales we may experience an increased inventory of used products and potentially increased writeoffs in addition product purchases by enterprises service providers and governmental entities are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays finally enterprise service providers and governmental entities typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers if sales expected from a large endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

the average sales prices of our products may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the average sales prices for our products may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts we offer a change in our mix of products anticipation of the introduction of new products or promotional programs competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or may bundle them with other products additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the average sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach or misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

  

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic or cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard services to effectively update endcustomers fortigate appliances and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the markets perception of our security products we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized thirdparty any defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in

our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

we have a high volume business that has grown over the last several years we rely heavily on information technology systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews however we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions like electronic data interchange which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on the manual processing of emails internally and from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a majority of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter a significant interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that quarter to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure operating and administrative systems and controls and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses our productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations 

  

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation valuation of inventory warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering and sales may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we have experienced turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highly skilled 

personnel is frequently intense especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel the san francisco bay area vancouver canada and beijing china a large portion of our employee base is substantially vested in significant stock option grants and the ability to exercise those options and sell their stock may result in a larger than normal turnover rate we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information 

  

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder president and chief executive officer michael xie our cofounder vice president of engineering and chief technical officer and ken goldman our vice president and chief financial officer could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives in addition key personnel may be distracted by activities unrelated to our business the loss of the services or distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global economic conditions weak economic conditions in certain geographies or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth 

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers 

  

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners 

  

our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner 

  

our proprietary fortiasic which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc faraday using umcs foundry kmicro using tsmcs foundry and renesas using umcs foundry manufacture our asics on a purchase order basis and these foundries do not guarantee any capacity and could reject orders from faraday kmicro or renesas or try to increase pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary or long term inventory shortages of our fortiasic as well as increased costs our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher 

volumes of products if any of these suppliers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics or specific product models our business would be harmed 

  

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the eu rohs and other similar laws 

  

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages long lead times for components and supply changes each of which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers result in inventory shortage and may result in the loss of sales and customers 

  

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing shortages and long lead times for certain components certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of central processing units from intel corporation advanced micro devices inc rminetlogic corporation and via technologies inc network chips from broadcom corporation marvell technology group ltd and intel and hard drives from western digital technologies inc the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

our manufacturing partners have experienced long lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products lead times for components may be adversely impacted by factors outside of our control such as natural disasters and other factors for example lead times for some components are currently being extended by the impact of flooding in thailand on certain suppliers our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

a majority of our operating expenses is incurred outside the united states these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar for example during the second and third  quarters of 2011 we were impacted by the weakening of the dollar against the canadian dollar and the euro which caused our operating expenses to increase although we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts and have periodically entered into cash flow hedges relating to certain operating expenses incurred outside of the united states if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if 

our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

product and service sales may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse effects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

  

because we incorporate encryption technology into our products certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required export license or through an export license exception if 

we were to fail to comply with us export licensing us customs regulations us economic sanctions and other laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

  

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permittinglicensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the european union or eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

  

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to incur more of these costs in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the near future if this exemption is revoked if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

  

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to governmental entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to governmental entities sales to governmental entities are subject to a number of risks selling to governmental entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a sale government demand and payment 

for our products and services may be negatively impacted by numerous factors and requirements unique to selling to government agencies such as public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations and requirements unique to government agencies with funding or purchasing reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products to date we have had limited traction in sales to us federal government agencies and any future sales to governmental entities is uncertain all of our sales to governmental entities have been made indirectly through our distribution channel governmental entities may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such governmental entity the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally purchases by the us government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

  

false detection of viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

  

our antivirus and our intrusion prevention services may falsely detect viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our antispam and antispyware services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers systems and cause material system failures any such false identification of important files or applications could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

if our internal network system is compromised by computer hackers public perception of our products and services will be harmed 

  

we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective network security protection because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers although we have not experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a thirdparty of our internal network if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems it could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services in addition such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide subscription and support services to our endcustomers if this happens our revenue could decline and our business could suffer 

  

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

  

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products if we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many enterprise service provider and governmental entity endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers if we fail to meet the requirements of the larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with larger endcustomers 

  

as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in accounting standards codification asc 74010 in addition asc 74010 applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

although we released our entire valuation allowance in fiscal 2009 we may in the future be required to establish a new valuation allowance we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

  

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

  

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimated our actual tax rate 

could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations 

  

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

  

in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities if tax authorities challenge the relative mix of us and international income our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

  

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products or technologies and intellectual property such as patents if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may not be accretive to earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in writeoffs that could be substantial further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property will significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

  

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released for example one of our highend product models experienced a defect in limited deployments product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert managements time and other resources 

  

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as civil unrest and terrorism 

  

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire a flood or significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors or logistics providers ability to perform services such as obtaining product components and manufacturing products on a timely basis and assisting with shipments on a timely basis in the event our or our service providers information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition regional instability acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

  

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

  

our url database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers expectations 

  

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet will impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn will harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is 

possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our users internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers and channel partners expectations will impair the growth of our business 

  

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

  

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow 

we are a relatively new entrant in the network security market and we believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness of our participation in that market market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large enterprise service provider and governmental entities markets if our marketing programs are not successful in creating market awareness of our company and products our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

  

demand for unified threat management products may be limited by market perception that utm products are inferior to 

network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of most of our products depend on increased demand for utm products if the utm market fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view utm “allinone” solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that utm products provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform utm solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of the utm product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that utm solutions may be suitable only for small and medium sized businesses because utm lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large enterprise service provider and governmental entity endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with the utm market in general demand for utm products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us or another well known utm vendor exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market especially from larger betterknown companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include networking companies such as cisco systems inc juniper networks inc and security vendors such as check point software technologies ltd mcafee inc acquired by intel corporation and sonicwall inc acquired by thoma bravo palo alto networks and other point solution security vendors 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets therefore these competitors will not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources such as junipers acquisition of netscreen technologies inc intels acquisition of mcafee and check points acquisition of nokias security appliance business as a result of such acquisitions our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services 

competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco systems inc and juniper networks inc offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organizations existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until at least 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from timetotime legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

  

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license gpl the gnu lesser public license lgpl the bsd license the apache license and others from timetotime there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other litigation matters could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they may also assert such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a thirdparty even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimants patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we have been involved in patent disputes in the past are currently involved in several patent disputes and likely will be involved in additional disputes in the future in may 2004 trend micro incorporated filed a complaint against us alleging that we infringed a trend micro patent related to antivirus software the international trade commission or itc subsequently instituted an investigation which resulted in an exclusion order and a cease and desist order prohibiting us from selling a broad array of our products in the united states in january 2006 we settled the lawsuit with trend micro and subsequently the itc terminated its action and rescinded the orders pursuant to the settlement and license agreement we initially paid trend micro 150 million the settlement and license agreement provides for additional quarterly royalty payments we had a subsequent dispute with trend micro regarding the royalty payments and in december 2011 we entered into a settlement agreement with trend micro resolving the dispute for a onetime payment of 90 million the settlement agreement includes a fullypaid license to the patents subject to the prior patent license agreement with no continuing obligation to pay royalties for those patents 

as discussed in item 3legal proceedings from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement and there are lawsuits claiming patent infringement currently pending we are also subject to other litigation in 

addition to patent infringement claims if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products in addition to the lawsuits described in legal proceedings several other nonpracticing patent holding companies have sent us letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 as well as other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these and proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our managements attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal 2011 as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2011 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in 2012 or future periods if our internal controls or disclosure controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of managements time in connection with further evaluations both of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

  

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

  

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition adopted by the financial accounting standards board fasb that went effective january 1 2011 the increased use of fair value measure the recent proposed change to revenue recognition lease accounting financial instrument accounting standards and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business effective january 1 2011 we started reporting revenue recognition based on the new revenue standards issued by the fasb if we do not ensure that our systems and processes for revenue recognition are aligned with the new standards we could encounter difficulties generating quarterly and annual financial statements in a timely manner which would have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our reporting obligations 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would 

likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 

  

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

  

our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business 

  

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months after that we may need to raise additional funds and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the pershare value of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the stockholders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms we may not be able to among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 

as of february 17 2012  our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 172 of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 

  

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 150 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in august 2009 trend micro filed a complaint against us in the superior court of the state of california for santa clara county alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment that we are obligated to make certain royalty payments to trend micro pursuant to a settlement and license agreement entered into in january 2006 in december 2011 we entered into a settlement agreement with trend micro resolving the dispute for a onetime payment to trend micro of 90 million the settlement agreement includes a fully paid license to the patents subject to the prior patent license agreement with no continuing obligation to pay royalties for those patents

business overview 

we provide network security solutions which enable broad integrated and high performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the it security infrastructure for enterprises service providers and governmental entities worldwide as of december 31 2011  we had shipped over 850000 appliances via more than 10000 channel partners to more than 125000 endcustomers worldwide including a majority of the 2011  fortune global 100 

our core utm product line of fortigate physical and virtual appliances ships with a set of security and networking capabilities including firewall vpn application control antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering antispam and wan acceleration functionality we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances which range from the fortigate20 designed for small businesses to the fortigate5000 series for large enterprises telecommunications carriers and service providers our utm solution also includes our fortiguard security subscription services which endcustomers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to the application control antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering vulnerability management and antispam functionality included in our appliances endcustomers can also choose to purchase forticare technical support services for our products endcustomers also often use fortimanager and fortianalyzer products in conjunction with a fortigate deployment to provide centralized management analysis and reporting capabilities we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise such as messaging web application firewalls databases employee 

computers and mobile devices sales of these complementary products have grown in recent quarters although these products still represent less than 100 of our total revenue during fiscal 2011  we expanded and enhanced our fortigate utm and fortiap secure wireless access product lines as well as introduced softwarebased virtual appliances for many of our fortigate and fortimanager product lines which help secure the endcustomers cloudbased network infrastructures with the same functionality as the traditional physical appliance in their respective product lines 

fiscal 2011 was our second full year as a public company following our initial public offering in november 2009 we believe the greater visibility and brand recognition derived from being a public company combined with success in selling to the enterprise and service provider customers and new product introductions served as contributors to the growth in our business during fiscal 2011 sales of fortigate products have generally been balanced across entrylevel fortigate20 to 100 series midrange fortigate200 to 800 series and highend fortigate1000 to 5000 series models with each product category representing approximately onethird of fortigate sales with some degree of variability from year to year and between quarters during fiscal 2011  we executed well against our strategy to grow the highend segment of our business consisting of sales to large enterprises service providers and telecommunications companies the percentage of our fortigate related billings from the highend category increased to 369 in fiscal 2011  from 343 in fiscal 2010  while the entrylevel category decreased from 350 to 321 and the midrange category remained relatively flat over the same period this shift towards the highend category positively impacted results in fiscal 2011 

we also believe continued product innovation has strengthened our technology advantage as evidenced by the earlier introduction of several noteworthy new fortigate appliance models such as the fg60c fg3040b fg3950b and fg5001b during fiscal 2011  we also made a significant investment in our sales force to expand our global presence both geographically as well as by industry segment we believe these factors have allowed us to penetrate into larger enterprise and service provider accounts as evidenced by the increase in the number of deals involving sales greater than 100000 

billings a nongaap financial measure that we define as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue were 4758 million  in fiscal 2011 an increase of 267  compared to fiscal 2010  total revenue was 4336 million  for fiscal 2011  an increase of 335 compared to fiscal 2010  revenue for fiscal 2011 includes approximately 200 million or 46 positive impact related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules as described in our summary of significant accounting policies included in  footnote 1 of our consolidated financial statements the increase in revenue resulting from our adoption of the new revenue recognition rules was attributable to both using best estimated sale price in our allocation of arrangement consideration when we did not have vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe and being able to recognize upon shipment certain product revenue which would have been deferred under the previous revenue recognition rules product revenue was 1974 million  an increase of 461 compared to fiscal 2010  and a greater percentage of total revenue 455 in fiscal 2011  compared to 416 in fiscal 2010  introduction of new products including some nonfortigate products was one factor in the growth of our product revenue services revenue in fiscal 2011  was 2203 million  an increase of 280 compared to fiscal 2010  services revenue is important to our future revenue and profitability as it provides a source of recurring revenue for us representing 508 and 530 of total revenue for fiscal 2011  and 2010  respectively ratable and other revenue in fiscal 2011  was 159 million  a decrease of 92  compared to fiscal 2010  primarily due to the decline in ratable revenue amortization due to the new revenue recognition rules 

we are a global geographically diversified business with 602 of our total revenue generated outside the united states canada and other americas americas regions in fiscal 2011 our operating results were driven by strong performance across all geographies for fiscal 2011  americas generated 1725 million  or 398  of our total revenue representing an increase of 392  from fiscal 2010  europe middle east and africa emea generated 1524 million  or 351  of our total revenue during fiscal 2011  representing an increase of 253  from fiscal 2010  asia pacific and japan apac generated 1087 million  or 251  of our total revenue during fiscal 2011 representing an increase of 374  from fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2011  our total operating expenses were 2311 million an increase of 255 compared to fiscal 2010 the 335 increase in revenues compared to the 255 increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2011 as discussed under results of operations below demonstrates the leverage that we achieved from the efficiencies in our business operations during the past year despite the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations experienced during fiscal 2011 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 534 from 567 during fiscal 2010 we are also experiencing improvements in productivity and efficiencies in our overall headcount as our annualized fiscal 2011  revenue per employee defined as annual revenue divided by average headcount reached 297000 up from 254000 for fiscal 2010  headcount increased from 1336 at the end of fiscal 2010  to 1583 at the end of fiscal 2011 as our pace of hiring increased during fiscal 2011  particularly in sales and marketing and research and development 

our business model 

our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers who in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to governmentfocused resellers large service providers and major systems integrators who have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements typically fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our physical and virtual appliances we invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and support services and the invoice generally becomes payable within 30 to 90 days we generally recognize product revenue upfront based on the allocated revenue value and defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal subscription and support services contracts we recognize the related services revenue over the service period which is typically one year from the date the endcustomer registers for these services the date on which the services can first be used by the customer although it can be as long as five years sales of new and renewal services increase our deferred revenue balance which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations 

key metrics 

we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies our total deferred revenue increased by 422 million  from 2526 million  at december 31 2010  to 2948 million  at december 31 2011  revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period is a useful metric that management identifies as billings billings for services drive deferred revenue which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business and has historically represented a majority of the revenue that we recognize in a typical quarter we also ended fiscal 2011  with 5387 million  in cash cash equivalents and investments and have had positive cash flow from operations every fiscal year since 2005 we discuss revenue gross margin and the components of operating income and margin below under “components of operating results” and we discuss our cash cash equivalents and investments under “liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue and cash provided by operating activities are discussed immediately below the following table 

  



  

deferred revenue  our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from subscription and support service contracts we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods the following table reflects the calculation of billings as discussed above 



cash provided by operating activities  we monitor cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance our cash provided by operating activities is driven in large part by advance payments for both new and renewal contracts for subscription and support services monitoring cash provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the noncash effects of certain items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expenses thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business free cash flow an alternative nongaap financial measure of liquidity is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 



other nongaap financial measures 

to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap we consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap including nongaap gross margin nongaap operating income and nongaap operating margin nongaap operating expenses nongaap net income and nongaap free cash flow these nongaap financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 

we use these nongaap financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to gaap measures in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance as they help illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in these nongaap financial measures furthermore we use many of these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we also believe that the use of these nongaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry many of which present similar nongaap financial measures to investors 

these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap there are a number of limitations related to the use of these nongaap financial measures versus the nearest gaap equivalent of these financial measures first these nongaap financial measures exclude certain recurring charges including but not limited to stockbased compensation expense asset acquisition related writeoffs and patent settlements stockbased compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and is an important part of our employees overall compensation second the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the expenses if any that our peer companies may exclude when they report their results of operations we compensate for these limitations by providing the nearest gaap equivalents of these nongaap financial measures and describing these gaap equivalents in our results of operations below 

nongaap gross margin is gross profit as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense which is a noncash charge nongaap income from operations is operating income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense asset acquisition related writeoffs and the income we received from a patent settlement nongaap operating margin is nongaap operating income divided by revenue the following table reconciles gaap gross profit operating income and operating margin to nongaap gross profit nongaap operating income and nongaap operating margin for fiscal 2011  2010  and 2009  



nongaap operating expenses exclude the impact of stockbased compensation expense and the impact of the patent settlements the following table reconciles gaap operating expenses to nongaap operating expenses for fiscal 2011  2010  and 2009  



nongaap net income is net income as reported in our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense asset acquisition related writeoffs and patent settlements the following table reconciles gaap net income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations to nongaap net income for fiscal 2011  2010  and 2009  



 

 

components of operating results 

revenue 

we derive our revenue from sales of our products and subscription and support services in fiscal 2011 we recognized our revenue in accordance with the guidance in asc 98560525 which is discussed in further detail in “—critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below according to asc 98560525 revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

  

 

   

 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

 

 

 

gross profit  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products any excess inventory writeoffs manufacturing costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services we believe our overall gross margin for the near term will remain at comparable levels compared to that achieved in fiscal 2011  

services revenue has historically increased as a percentage of total revenue since inception and this trend has had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher services gross margins compared to product gross margins we generally maintained consistent services gross margins in fiscal 2011  and fiscal 2010  

  

operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of cashbased personnel costs such as salaries benefits bonuses and with regard to the sales and marketing expense and sales commissions they also include noncash charges specifically stockbased compensation we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees 

 

 

 43 

comparable as a percentage of total revenue compared to fiscal 2011 results barring unforeseen litigation 

interest income  interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities municipal bonds term deposits and us government and agency debt securities 

other income expense net  other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange and related hedging gains and losses foreign exchange gains and losses relate to foreign currency exchange remeasurement the hedging gains and losses are related to our settled balance sheet hedges 

provision for benefit from income taxes  we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than us tax rates and may be subject to current us income taxes our effective tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the us research and development tax credits withholding taxes nondeductible compensation and expenses and adjustments related to our intercompany transfer pricing 

the income tax provision for fiscal 2011  was comprised primarily of domestic income taxes foreign income taxes and withholding taxes the 2011  effective tax rate was impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries as well as the reinstated us federal research and development tax credit the income tax provision for fiscal 2009 reflected a tax benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance which resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets as a result of fully reversing our valuation allowance we expect that our effective tax rate will approximate the us federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes research and development tax credits when applicable withholding tax nondeductible compensation and adjustments related to intercompany transfer pricing 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation valuation of inventory warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to the financial statements included in this 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

in october 2009 the fasb amended the asc as summarized in accounting standards update asu no 200914 software topic 985 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu no 200913 revenue recognition topic   605 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  asu 200914 amends industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions to exclude from its scope tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality asu 200913 amends the accounting for multipleelement arrangements to provide guidance on how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and eliminates the use of the residual method asu 200913 also requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method the standard establishes a hierarchy of evidence to determine the standalone selling price of a deliverable based on vsoe thirdparty evidence tpe and the besp if vsoe is available it would be used to determine the selling price of a deliverable if vsoe is not available the entity would determine whether tpe is available if so tpe must be used to determine the selling price if tpe is not available then the besp would be used 

for all transactions originating or materially modified after december 31 2010 we recognize revenue in accordance with asu 200913 certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may continue to have software deliverables that are subject to asc 985605 along with nonsoftware deliverables that are subject to the asu 200913 when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements such as hardware appliances software customer support services andor professional services we 

allocate revenue to each element based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy in multiple element arrangements where software is morethanincidental revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy in asu 200913 

  

vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical standalone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates in addition we consider major segments geographies customer classifications and other variables in determining vsoe 

  

we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately generally our gotomarket strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained furthermore we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a standalone basis 

  

for our hardware appliances we use besp as our selling price for our support and services we generally use vsoe as our selling price when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe for our support and services we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including but not limited to cost of products gross margin objectives pricing practices geographies customer classes and distribution channels we review our besp estimates on a quarterly basis to coincide with our vsoe review process 

  

we derive revenue from sales of products including appliances and software and services including subscription support and other services our appliances include operating system software that is integrated into the appliance hardware and is deemed essential to its functionality as a result we account for revenue in accordance with asc 985605 and all related interpretations see “—summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of new revenue recognition standards that we adopted in fiscal 2011 

revenue can be recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

  

   

 

   

 

for arrangements which include endcustomer acceptance criteria revenue is recognized upon acceptance we recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to endcustomers upon shipment once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we also recognize revenue upon sellthrough for distributor agreements that allow for rights of return such returns are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services which consist of subscriptions andor support subscription services provide access to our antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades maintenance releases and patches telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 

the subscription and support services start on the date the customer registers the appliance the customer is then entitled to service for the stated contractual period beginning on the registration date 

  

we offer certain sales incentives to channel partners we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances additionally in limited circumstances we allow our customers to return our products subject to varying limitations for a refund within a reasonably short period of time from the date of purchase we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience 

at december 31 2011  our allowance for sales returns was 24 million  compared to 20 million  at december 31 2010  if our allowance for sales returns had increased by 100 or 02 million  our net revenue would have decreased by 02 million  in fiscal 2011  

stockbased compensation 

employees  we have accounted for stockbased awards to employees in accordance with asc 718 which requires compensation expense related to sharebased transactions including employee stock options to be measured and recognized in the financial statements based on a determination of the fair value of the stock options the grant date fair value is determined using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model for all employee stock options we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term and forfeiture rate any changes in these highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact stockbased compensation expense 

employee stock purchase plan  we apply asc 718 to stock purchase rights which requires compensation expense related to sharebased transactions including stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan espp to be measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value the grant date fair value is determined using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model our espp provides for consecutive sixmonth offering periods with the first offering period having commenced on august 15 2011 and ended on february 14 2012 

valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record additional inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

warranty liabilities 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on hardware products and a 90day warranty on software a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is charged to cost of product revenue based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our gross margin could be adversely affected 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in estimating future tax consequences generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities we provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed more likely than not that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 74010 which defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements asc 74010 requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date we 

consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the future we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets as a result we released all of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted 

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 



 

 



fiscal years 2011  and 2010   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased 1089 million  or 335  in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules described in note 1of our consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k contributed 200 million of the increase primarily with respect to product revenue the americas and apac regions contributed the largest portion of our revenue growth on a percentage basis product revenue increased 623 million  or 461  compared to fiscal 2010  the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by greater sales volume and higher average sales prices in our fortigate product family due to increased demand for our highend products from enterprise and service provider customers the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition rules referenced above also contributed to the increase in product revenue services revenue increased 482 million  or 280  in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  due to the recognition of revenue from our increased focus on contract renewals and our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base ratable and other revenue was 42 million lower due to the impact of no longer deferring ratable revenue as a result of the abovementioned adoption of new revenue recognition rules 

offset by a 26 million sale of previouslyacquired patents 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



total gross margin remained consistent in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  product gross margin increased 13  percentage points in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  primarily due to a greater mix of our highend products from time to time we have experienced sales of previously reserved inventory during fiscal 2011 we experienced a positive impact of 04 percentage points in our product gross margin due to the sale of fully reserved inventory compared to a positive impact of 07 percentage points in fiscal 2010 services gross margin was relatively flat as we continued to make investments in our support professional services and fortiguard global security organizations at a rate slightly greater than the increase in revenue in order to improve service capabilities services cost increased by 85 million  primarily due to a 61 million increase in cashbased personnel costs related to headcount increases a 09 million increase in stockbased compensation a 08 million increase in warranty and other expenses and a 07 million increase in professional services costs ratable and other revenue gross margin increased 51  percentage points as a result of a 26 million sale of previouslyacquired patents during fiscal 2011 which had a direct positive impact to gross margins 

operating expenses 

  



research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 138 million  or 277  in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  primarily due to an increase in cashbased personnel costs and stockbased compensation expense cashbased personnel costs increased by 97 million as a result of increased headcount to support continued enhancements of our existing products stockbased compensation expense increased by 24 million primarily due to the increase in headcount and stock price and the introduction of the espp in fiscal 2011 in addition we incurred increases in product development expenses such as nonrecurring engineering nre testing and certifications of 08 million depreciation expense of 06 million occupancyrelated costs of 02 million and other expenses of 01 million the increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate against the us dollar also significantly contributed to the increase in research and development expenses by 20 million 

sales and marketing expense 

sales and marketing expense increased 336 million  or 300  in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to expand our global footprint cashbased personnel costs increased by 213 million primarily as a result of increased headcount stockbased compensation expense increased by 55 million primarily due to the increase in headcount and stock price and the introduction of the espp in fiscal 2011 in addition we incurred increases in marketingrelated expenses of 29 million and travel of 15 million to support our overall revenue growth of 335 we also had a combined 16 million increase in depreciation and other expenses and a 08 million increase in occupancyrelated costs as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased 09  percentage points due to the leverage we are achieving from the investment in our sales force in fiscal 2011 as evidenced by revenue growth of 335 exceeding sales and marketing expenses growth of 300 

general and administrative expense 

in fiscal 2011  general and administrative expense decreased 04 million  or 19  compared to fiscal 2010  cashbased personnel costs increased 15 million stockbased compensation expense increased 09 million and occupancyrelated costs and other expenses increased a combined 01 million partially offset by 20 million in royalties received from a patent settlement and a 10 million decrease in legal expenses compared to fiscal 2010 

interest income and other income expense net 

  



the 17 million  increase in interest income in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  was primarily due to interest earned on our higher balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other income expense net for fiscal 2011  when compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of lower foreign exchange losses in fiscal 2011 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

  



  

our effective tax rate was 321  for fiscal 2011  compared with an effective tax rate of 268  for fiscal 2010  the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2011  was comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes the 2010 effective tax rate is impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries as well as the reinstated us federal research and development tax credit the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in profits subject to us tax 

fiscal years 2010  and 2009   

revenue 

  



total revenue increased 726 million or 288 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the americas region contributed the largest portion of this growth product revenue increased 365 million or 369 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase in product revenue was driven by higher product sales volume across all regions a greater mix of our highend products and increased sales to enterprise and service provider customers contributed to a 79 increase in the number of 500000 deals in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 services revenue increased 329 million or 236 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base and our increased focus on contract renewals the growth in services revenue tends to lag growth in billings and product revenue due to amortization of revenue over the service period the growth in ratable and other revenue was due to a slight decrease in the weightedaverage service period as a result of a decrease in the average contractual term of support contracts for arrangements in which we recognized product and services revenue ratably 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



total gross margin increased 16 percentage points in fiscal 2010 primarily due to improved product margins in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 product gross margin increased 43 percentage points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a greater mix of our highend products and the absence of asset acquisition related writeoffs compared to a 24 million writeoff in fiscal 2009 from time to time we have experienced sales of previously reserved inventory during fiscal 2010 we experienced a positive impact of 07 percentage points due to the sale of fully reserved inventory compared to a 

positive impact of 11 percentage points in fiscal 2009 services gross margin was relatively flat as we continued to make investments in our support professional services and fortiguard global security research organizations to support the growing revenue base services cost increased by 47 million primarily due to a 29 million increase in cashbased personnel costs related to headcount increases travel depreciation and other expenses increased a combined 08 million in addition occupancyrelated costs increased 07 million and stockbased compensation increased 03 million ratable and other revenue gross margin increased 29 percentage points as a result of leverage achieved from cost reductions with respect to overhead 

operating expenses 

  



research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 76 million or 180 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase of 52 million in cashbased personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support continued enhancements of our products higher occupancyrelated costs of 17 million due to a move into a new office facility in vancouver with significantly increased square footage plus early termination and moving costs an increase of 04 million in stockbased compensation expense and an increase of 03 million in product development related expenses such as nonrecurring engineering nre testing and certifications a 10 increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate against the us dollar also significantly contributed to the increase in research and development expenses 

sales and marketing expense 

sales and marketing expense increased 157 million or 163 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to expand our global footprint the increase consisted of cashbased personnel costs of 145 million as a result of increased headcount a 13 million increase in travel as a result of our overall sales growth of 29 and particularly sales growth in the americas of 34 a 08 million increase in stockbased compensation expense and a 02 million increase in professional services these increases were partially offset by a 11 million decrease in marketingrelated expenses as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased 37 percentage points due to the leverage we are achieving from the investment in our sales force during the past year as evidenced by revenue growth of 29 exceeding sales and marketing expenses growth of 16 

general and administrative expense 

in fiscal 2010 general and administrative expense increased 41 million or 222 compared to fiscal 2009 the increase was primarily due to a 18 million increase in legal expenses to support various patent litigation matters and a 06 million increase in accountingrelated expenses due to being a public company in addition cashbased personnel costs increased 13 million and stockbased compensation expense increased 04 million 

interest income and other income expense net 

  



the 02 million decrease in interest income in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to lower interest rates earned despite higher balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other income expense net for fiscal 2010 when compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of foreign exchange losses in fiscal 2010 due to the weakening of the us dollar against the australian dollar chinese yuan and japanese yen 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

  



 

not meaningful 

our effective tax rate was 268 for fiscal 2010 compared with an effective tax rate of negative 1187 for fiscal 2009 the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2010 is comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes the 2010 effective tax rate is impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries as well as the reinstated us federal research and development tax credit the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 reflected the release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in fiscal 2009 we generated pretax income in fiscal 2009 and 2008 as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected future taxable income we reversed approximately 442 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2009 after having determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized this reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit totaling 378 million our estimates of future taxable income represent critical accounting estimates because such estimates are subject to change and a downward adjustment could have a significant impact on future earnings furthermore we continue to evaluate our net deferred tax asset position in regards to the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight fiscal quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products subscriptions and services in general a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend has positively impacted sales activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential billings and product revenues which results in lower product revenue our product revenue in the third quarter can be negatively affected by reduced economic activity in europe during the summer months during fiscal 2011 the growth in the americas during the third quarter more than offset the slight decline in europe but this may not always be the case similarly our gross margins and operating income have been affected by these historical trends because expenses are relatively fixed in the nearterm although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of a quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

our total quarterly revenue over the past twelve quarters has increased sequentially in each quarter except the first quarter of 2011 which was essentially flat product revenue in all of the quarters of fiscal 2011  was higher as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2010  which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales organization continued product innovation and improvements in overall corporate it spending as well as the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules in fiscal 2011 



quarterly gross margin trend 

total gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services product gross margin varies based on the types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products services gross margins have remained relatively consistent as we continue to invest in our support organizations at a rate slightly greater than the increase in service revenue 



  



liquidity and capital resources 

  



at december 31 2011  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 5387 million  were held for workingcapital purposes and were invested primarily in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities municipal bonds term deposits and us government and agency debt securities at december 31 2011 243 million of our cash was held by our international subsidiaries and is therefore not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless the cash is repatriated while we do not intend to do so should this amount be repatriated it would be subject to us federal income tax which would be partially offset by foreign tax credits we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011  

  



 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

during fiscal 2011  2010  and 2009  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper money market funds government and corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2011  2010  and 2009  would have resulted in a decrease in our interest income of approximately 04 million 02 million and 02 million respectively 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the us are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar cad euro eur british pound gbp and japanese yen jpy to help protect against significant fluctuations in the value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to hedge balance sheet items denominated in eur gbp and cad we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the creditworthiness of these parties these contracts typically have maturities between one and three months we account for our hedges under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts as other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations we recognized an expense of 04 million  in other income expense net in fiscal 2011  due to foreign currency transaction losses 

our hedging activities are intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements as our hedging activities are relatively shortterm in nature longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar versus the eur gbp cad or jpy could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

manufacturing and suppliers 

  

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers our current manufacturing partners include flextronics international ltd micro star international ltd creation technologies inc and a number of additional taiwanbased manufacturers we submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured the delivery date and other delivery terms once our products are manufactured they are sent to either our headquarters in sunnyvale california or to our logistics partner in taoyuan city taiwan where accessory packaging and qualitycontrol testing are performed we use one thirdparty logistics provider that accounted for a material portion of our shipments in fiscal 2009 and in fiscal 2010  we believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to conserve capital better adjust manufacturing volumes to meet changes in demand and more quickly deliver products while allowing us to focus resources on our core competencies our proprietary fortiasic which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and tsmc faraday using umc’s foundry and kmicro using tsmc’s foundry manufacture our asics on a purchase order basis accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for the fabrication of our asics could be increased on short notice 

  

the components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or more frequently by our contract manufacturers some of the components important to our business including central processing units from intel amd rmi and via and network chips from broadcom marvell and intel are available from a limited or sole source of supply 

  

we have no longterm contracts related to the manufacturing of our asics or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms 

  

research and development 

  

we focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and systems and adding new features to existing products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that are or are expected to be needed by our endcustomers our success in designing developing manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors including the identification of market demand for new products product selection timely implementation of product design and development product performance effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing 

  

as of december 31 2010  our research and development organization had headcount of 428 people predominantly in canada china and the united states our research and development expense in fiscal 2010 was 498 million  in fiscal 2009 was 422 million and in fiscal 2008 was 370 million  

  

intellectual property 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology as of december 31 2010  we had 55 issued us patents 11 issued chinese patents 1 issued japanese patent 94 patent applications pending for examination in the united states and 19 patent applications pending for examination in china we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

  

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in particular leading companies in the networking industry have extensive patent portfolios from timetotime third parties including certain of these leading companies have asserted and may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected we typically indemnify our endcustomers distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties 

  

competition 

  

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

  

• product performance features effectiveness interoperability and reliability 

  

• technological expertise 

  

• price of products and services and total cost of ownership 

  

• brand recognition 

  

• customer service and support 

  

• sales and distribution capabilities 

  

• compliance with industry standards and certifications 

  

• size and financial stability of operations and 

  

• breadth of product line 

  

our competitors include networking companies such as cisco systems inc and juniper networks inc security vendors such as check point software technologies ltd mcafee inc pending acquisition by intel inc and sonicwall inc acquired by thoma bravo and other point solution security vendors 

  

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance reliability and breadth and our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and based on our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt 

to add incremental features and functionality 

  

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products in addition our larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2010  our total headcount was 1336 people including payrolled contractors we had 428 in research and development 486 in sales and marketing 283 in services and support 31 in manufacturing operations and 108 in a general and administrative capacity as of december 31 2010  our headcount was 314 people in the united states 430 in canada 83 in france 216 in china and 293 in other countries 

  

none of our us employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us however our employees in france spain and italy are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors 

  

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose some or all of your investment 

  

risks related to our business 

  

our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

  

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial and other operating results including fluctuations in our key metrics this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our internal operating plan or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends accordingly in the event of 

revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

  

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue to fall below expected levels 

  

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas historically we have received a substantial portion of a quarters sales orders and generated a substantial portion of a quarters revenue during the last two weeks or last days of the quarter if expected revenue at the end of any quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our or our logistics partners inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter our failure to manage inventory to meet demand our inability to release new products on schedule any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

we rely significantly on revenue from subscription and support services which may decline and because we recognize revenue from subscriptions and support services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

  

services revenue accounts for a significant portion of our revenue comprising 530 of total revenue for fiscal 2010  552 of total revenue for fiscal 2009  and 497 of total revenue for fiscal 2008 sales of new or renewal subscription and services contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including endcustomers level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers spending levels if our sales of new or renewal subscription and services contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business will suffer in addition we recognize subscription and service revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically one year but has been as long as five years as a result much of the revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription and services contracts entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscription or service contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions or services is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods our subscription and service revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal service contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period furthermore increases in the average term of services contracts would result in revenue for services contracts being recognized over longer periods of time 

  

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

  

our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high return product or take advantage of price protection if any or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand furthermore if the time required to manufacture certain products or ship products increases for any reason this could result in inventory shortfalls management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products and models that we sell 

  

in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins alternatively insufficient inventory levels which we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors products that are readily available if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our distribution partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

we rely on thirdparty channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

  

substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners which include distributors and 

resellers we depend upon our channel partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed the termination of our relationship with any significant channel partner may also adversely impact our sales and operating results 

  

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements they may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products they may have incentives to promote our competitors products to the detriment of our own they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot assure you that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results in addition any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

  

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to larger endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

  

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large enterprises service providers and government entities sales to enterprises service providers and government entities involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smalltomidsized entities these risks include 

  

   

   

   

   

large enterprises service providers and government entities often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases over 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to larger endcustomers due to the lengthy nature the size and scope and stringent requirements of these evaluations we typically provide evaluation products to these customers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales if we are unsuccessful in converting these evaluations into sales we may experience an increased inventory of used products and potentially increased writeoffs in addition product purchases by enterprises service providers and government entities are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays finally enterprise service providers and government entities typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers if sales expected from a large endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

the average sales prices of our products may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results and the trading price of our common stock 

  

the average sales prices for our products may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures 

discounts we offer a change in our mix of products anticipation of the introduction of new products or promotional programs competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or may bundle them with other products additionally although we price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the average sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

  

defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach or misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

  

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers defects or vulnerabilities may impede or block network traffic or cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard services to effectively update endcustomers fortigate appliances and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

  

an actual or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the markets perception of our security products we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized thirdparty any defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our operating results will be negatively affected 

  

we have a high volume business that has grown over the last several years we rely heavily on information technology systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts inventory and supply chain management and trade compliance reviews however we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions like electronic data interchange which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on the manual processing of emails internally and from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a majority of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter a significant interruption in our 

email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that quarter to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure operating and administrative systems and controls and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses our productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations 

  

we have a history of losses and may not maintain profitability and our revenue growth may not continue 

  

we have incurred net losses in most fiscal years since our inception including net losses of 218 million in fiscal 2007 53 million in fiscal 2006 142 million in fiscal 2005 and 590 million in fiscal 2004 as a result we had an accumulated deficit of 187 million at december 31 2010  although we were profitable in fiscal 2008 2009 and 2010  we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase revenue or deferred revenue manage our cost structure or are subject to unanticipated liabilities revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons including slowing demand for our products or services increasing competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities any failure by us to maintain profitability and continue our revenue growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

  

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation valuation of inventory warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes 

  

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

  

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering and sales may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations we have experienced turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel the san francisco bay area vancouver canada and beijing china a large portion of our employee base is substantially vested in significant stock option grants and the ability to exercise those options and sell their stock may result in a larger than normal 

turnover rate we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information 

  

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder president and chief executive officer michael xie our cofounder vice president of engineering and chief technical officer and ken goldman our vice president and chief financial officer could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives in addition key personnel may be distracted by activities unrelated to our business the loss of the services or distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

  

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources weak global economic conditions weak economic conditions in certain geographies or a reduction in information technology spending regardless of macroeconomic conditions could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth 

  

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers 

  

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners 

  

our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays increased manufacturing leadtimes disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

  

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner 

  

our proprietary fortiasic which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc faraday using umcs foundry and kmicro using tsmcs foundry manufacture our asics on a purchase order basis and these foundries do not guarantee any capacity and could reject orders from either faraday or kmicro or try to increase pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary or long term inventory shortages of our fortiasic as well as increased costs our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes of products if any of these suppliers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics or specific product models our business would be harmed 

  

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the eu rohs and other similar laws see “if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected” for information on the effects of the failure to comply with these laws 

  

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers and may result in the loss of sales and customers 

  

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have faced component shortages in the past certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of central processing units from intel corporation advanced micro devices inc rmi corporation and via technologies inc and network chips from broadcom corporation marvell technology group ltd and intel the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

our manufacturing partners have experienced increasing lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the occurrence of any of these would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition a majority of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar although we have been hedging currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts and have recently entered into cashflow hedges relating to certain operating expenses incurred outside of the united states if we stop hedging against any of these risks or if our attempts to hedge against these currency exposures are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

  

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

product and service sales may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse affects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

  

certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products if we were to fail to comply with us export licensing us customs regulations us economic sanctions and other laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

  

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and in reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permittinglicensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the european union or eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

  

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to incur more of these costs in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the near future if revoked if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

  

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

  

our failure to comply with these and future environmental rules and regulations could result in reduced sales of our products increased costs substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

  

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales into government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a sale government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products most of our sales to government entities have been made indirectly through our distribution channel government entities may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such governmental entity the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors 

administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

  

false detection of viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

  

our antivirus and our intrusion prevention services may falsely detect viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our antispam and antispyware services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers systems and cause material system failures any such false identification of important files or applications could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

if our internal network system is compromised by computer hackers public perception of our products and services will be harmed 

  

we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective network security protection because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers although we have not experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a thirdparty of our internal network if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems it could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services in addition such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide subscription and support services to our endcustomers if this happens our revenue could decline and our business could suffer 

  

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

  

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products if we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many enterprise service provider and government entity endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers if we fail to meet the requirements of the larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with larger endcustomers 

  

as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including 

  

 19 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in asc 74010  formerly referred to as statement of financial accounting standards sfas interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of sfas no 109 fin 48  in addition asc 74010 applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

although we released our entire valuation allowance in fiscal 2009 we may in the future be required to establish a new valuation allowance we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

  

we are currently under audit by the canada revenue agency for fiscal years 20062009 associated with our international transactions the california franchise tax board has notified us of their intent to examine our fiscal 2008 and 2009 california tax returns the scope of the california franchise tax board examinations is unclear at this time 

  

if the ultimate determination of income taxes assessed under the current canadian or california audits or under audits being conducted or to be conducted in any of the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

  

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and 

losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimated our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations 

  

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

  

in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities if tax authorities challenge the relative mix of us and international income our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

  

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products or technologies and intellectual property such as patents if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may not be accretive to earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in writeoffs that could be substantial further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property will significantly divert management time and resources 

  

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

  

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released for example one of our highend product models has been experiencing a defect in limited deployments product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

although we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert managements time and other resources 

  

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

  

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire a flood or significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors or logistics providers ability to perform services such as manufacturing products on a timely basis and assisting with shipments on a timely basis for example our primary international logistics provider is located in taiwan which is an area known for typhoons in the event our or our service providers information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition acts of terrorism and other geopolitical unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

risks related to our industry 

  

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

  

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability for example in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we released a new model within our fortigate product line and after its initial release we detected errors in the product that required us to redesign certain aspects of the product which delayed the availability of the product for one quarter and delayed our recognition of revenue from large orders that included such product until the following quarter when the product became available if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

  

our url database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers expectations 

  

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet will impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn will harm our business 

financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our users internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers and channel partners expectations will impair the growth of our business 

  

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

  

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

  

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

  

unless we continue to develop better market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow 

  

we are a relatively new entrant in the network security market and we believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness of our participation in that market market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to 

our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large enterprise service provider and government entities markets if our marketing programs are not successful in creating market awareness of our company and products our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

  

demand for unified threat management products may be limited by market perception that utm products are inferior to network security solutions from multiple vendors 

  

sales of most of our products depend on increased demand for utm products if the utm market fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view utm “allinone” solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that utm products provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform utm solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of the utm product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that utm solutions may be suitable only for small and medium sized businesses because utm lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large enterprise service provider and government entity endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with the utm market in general demand for utm products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us or another well known utm vendor exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

  

we face intense competition in our market especially from larger betterknown companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

  

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include networking companies such as cisco systems inc and juniper networks inc security vendors such as check point software technologies ltd mcafee inc pending acquisition by intel inc and sonicwall inc acquired by thoma bravo and other point solution security vendors 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by 

third parties with greater available resources such as junipers acquisition of netscreen technologies inc intels pending acquisition of mcafee and check points acquisition of nokias security appliance business as a result of such acquisitions our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

  

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

  

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco systems inc and juniper networks inc offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organizations existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

risks related to intellectual property 

  

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

  

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology we purchased most of our issued us patents and many of our pending us patent applications from other entities valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

  

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from timetotime legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and 

financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

  

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

  

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license gpl the gnu lesser public license lgpl the bsd license the apache license and others from timetotime there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

  

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could harm our business 

  

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they may also assert such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a thirdparty even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

  

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 

  

alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimants patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we have been involved in patent disputes in the past are currently involved in several patent disputes and likely will be involved in additional disputes in the future in may 2004 trend micro incorporated filed a complaint against us alleging that we infringed a trend micro patent related to antivirus software the international trade commission or itc subsequently instituted an investigation which resulted in an exclusion order and a cease and desist order prohibiting us from selling a broad array of our products in the united states in january 2006 we settled the lawsuit with trend micro and subsequently the itc terminated its action and rescinded the orders pursuant to the settlement and license agreement we initially paid trend micro 150 million the settlement and license agreement provides for additional quarterly royalty payments not expected to exceed 1 of our total revenue each quarter through 2015 in november 2008 we filed a complaint against trend micro in the united 

states district court for the northern district of california alleging among other claims that the patents that are the basis for the ongoing royalty payments are invalid and consequently that we have no contractual obligation to pay the royalties trend micro moved to dismiss the case and in june 2009 the court dismissed the case without prejudice on procedural grounds and we appealed the dismissal in july 2009 based on the dispute we ceased paying royalties under the settlement and license agreement in august 2009 trend micro filed a complaint against us in the superior court of the state of california for santa clara county alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment that we are obligated to make certain royalty payments to trend micro in december 2009 we withdrew our appeal of the june 2009 dismissal by the united states district court for the northern district of california and filed a new complaint against trend micro in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging among other claims that the patents that are the basis for the ongoing royalty payments are invalid and consequently that we have no contractual obligation to pay the royalties in february 2010 trend micro filed demurrers in the state superior court action regarding fortinets affirmative defenses that fortinet has no obligation to pay royalties because the trend micro patents are invalid or unenforceable in march 2010 trend micro filed a motion to dismiss our new complaint that we filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california in may 2010 the state superior court denied trend micros demurrer in its entirety also in may 2010 the united states district court for the northern district of california denied trend micros motion to dismiss without prejudice and stayed the action before that court pending the conclusion of the state superior court action in january 2011 in response to petitions for reexamination we filed with the us patent and trademark office pto the pto issued an initial office action that trend micros patents at issue were invalid in january 2011 we filed a motion to stay the superior court case pending final resolution at the pto our motion to stay is currently pending at this stage it is not possible to predict the outcome an adverse outcome in this dispute could result in accelerated royalty payments and additional damages 

  

as discussed in item 3legal proceedings from time to time we are subject to lawsuits claiming patent infringement and there are lawsuits claiming patent infringement currently pending if we are unsuccessful in defending any such claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products in addition to the lawsuits described in legal proceedings several other nonpracticing patent holding companies have sent us letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

  

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

  

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

  

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 as well as other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices these and proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our managements attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly we completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal 2010 as required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 although our assessment testing and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december 31 2010 our internal controls over financial reporting were effective we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods if our internal controls or disclosure controls are ineffective in future periods our business and reputation could be harmed we may incur additional expenses and commitment of managements time in connection with further evaluations both 

of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our operating results 

  

changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 

  

a change in accounting standards or practices and varying interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements such as changes to standards related to revenue recognition recently adopted by the fasb the increased use of fair value measure the recent proposed change to revenue recognition lease accounting financial instrument accounting standards and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 

  

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

  

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

  

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report and other factors such as rumors or fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 

  

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

  

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

  

our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business 

  

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months after that we may need to raise additional funds and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the pershare value of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the stockholders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms we may not be able to among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

 28 

  

   

our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 

  

as of february 17 2011  our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 211 of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 

  

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

  

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

  

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

  

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

in april 2010 an individual a former stockholder of fortinet filed a class action lawsuit against us in the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles alleging violation of various california corporations code sections and related tort claims alleging misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty regarding the 2009 repurchase by fortinet of shares of its stock while we were a privatelyheld company in september 2010 the court granted our motion to transfer the case to the california superior court for santa clara county 

  

in addition to the above matters we are subject to other litigation in the ordinary course of business the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty if we do not prevail in any of these legal matters our operating results may be materially affected at this time we are unable to estimate the financial impact these actions will likely have on us

business overview 

  

we provide network security solutions which enable broad integrated and high performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the it security infrastructure for enterprises service providers and government entities worldwide as of december 31 2010  we had shipped over 675000 appliances to more than 5000 channel partners and to more than 100000 endcustomers worldwide including a majority of the 2010 fortune global 100 

  

our core utm product line of fortigate appliances ships with a set of security and networking capabilities including firewall vpn antivirus intrusion prevention application control web filtering antispam and wan acceleration functionality we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances which range from the fortigate30 designed for small businesses and branch offices to the fortigate5000 series for large enterprises and service providers our utm solution also includes our fortiguard security subscription services which endcustomers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to the antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality included in our appliances endcustomers can also choose to purchase forticare technical support services for our products we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software that offer additional protection from 

security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise such as messaging webbased traffic and databases and employee computers or handheld devices sales of these complimentary products have grown in recent quarters although these products still represent less than 10 of our total revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we began shipping virtual appliances for our fortigate and fortimanager product lines which help secure the endcustomers cloudbased network infrastructures with the same functionality as the traditional physical appliance in their respective product lines 

  

fiscal 2010 was our first full year as a public company following our initial public offering in november 2009 we believe the greater visibility and brand recognition derived from being a public company combined with success in selling to the enterprise and service provider customers and new product introductions served as contributors to the acceleration in our business during fiscal 2010 sales of fortigate products have generally been balanced across entrylevel fortigate30 to 100 series midrange fortigate200 to 800 series and highend fortigate1000 to 5000 series models with each product category representing approximately onethird of fortigate sales with some degree of variability from year to year and between quarters during fiscal 2010 we executed well against our strategy to grow the highend segment of our business consisting of sales to large enterprises service providers and telecommunications companies the percentage of our fortigate related billings from the highend category increased to 34 in fiscal 2010 from 30 in fiscal 2009 while the entrylevel category decreased from 38 to 35 and the midrange category remained relatively flat over the same period 

  

we also believe continued product innovation has strengthened our technology advantage as evidenced by the introduction of several noteworthy new fortigate appliance models such as the fg60c fg3040b and fg3950b during fiscal 2010 we also made a significant investment in our salesforce to expand our global presence both geographically as well as by industry segment we believe these factors have allowed us to penetrate into larger enterprise and service provider accounts as evidenced by the increase in the number of deals involving sales greater than 100000 and a substantial increase in the number of deals greater than 250000 and 500000 compared to fiscal 2009 

  

continuing to grow our enterprise and highend business will remain a strategic priority in fiscal 2011 as we continue to focus on further penetrating the financial services healthcare federal government and service provider verticals which tend to purchase our midrange and highend products though we are a global geographically diversified business with 62 of our total revenue generated outside of the americas region in fiscal 2010 we see opportunities to further expand our geographic presence across all regions we intend to continue to invest in sales and research and development staff to address these opportunities 

  

billings a nongaap financial measure that we define as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue further described under nongaap financial measures were 3754 million  an increase of 33 compared to fiscal 2009 total revenue was 3247 million for fiscal 2010 an increase of 29 compared to fiscal 2009 product revenue was 1351 million an increase of 37 compared to fiscal 2009 and a greater percentage of total revenue 42 in fiscal 2010 compared to 39 in fiscal 2009 a factor in the product revenue growth was the introduction of new products over the past year including some nonfortigate products services revenue in fiscal 2010 was 1720 million an increase of 24 compared to fiscal 2009 services revenue is important to our future revenue and profitability as it provides a source of recurring revenue for us representing 53 and 55 of total revenue for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively ratable product and services revenue in fiscal 2010 was 175 million an increase of 23 compared to fiscal 2009 

  

for fiscal 2010 1240 million  or 38  of our total revenue was generated from the americas representing an increase of 34 from fiscal 2009 europe middle east and africa emea generated 1216 million  or 38  of our total revenue during fiscal 2010 representing an increase of 27 from fiscal 2009 asia pacific and japan apac generated 791 million  or 24  of our total revenue during fiscal 2010 representing an increase of 24 from fiscal 2009 

  

in fiscal 2010 we experienced increased leverage from our prior investments in our sales and marketing organization combined with our continued focus on effectively managing related expenses as evidenced by the fact that sales and marketing expenses increased 16 from fiscal 2009 while our revenue increased 29 from fiscal 2009 as discussed under results of operations below we are also seeing improvements in productivity and efficiencies in our overall headcount as our annualized fiscal 2010 revenue per employee defined as revenue divided by average headcount reached 254000 up from 217000 for fiscal 2009 although headcount increased during fiscal 2010 from 1223 at the end of fiscal 2009 to 1336 our pace of hiring was slower than originally targeted for fiscal 2010 as it was a challenge to hire qualified sales and technical staff as quickly as we had anticipated due in part to the competitive landscape the degree of specialized security expertise required and increased turnover as the business climate improved within our industry 

  

our business model 

  

our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to 

distributors who sell to resellers and service providers who in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to governmentfocused resellers large service providers and major systems integrators who have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements typically fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our appliances we invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and support services and the invoice generally becomes payable within 30 to 90 days we generally recognize product revenue upfront but defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal subscription and support services contracts we recognize the related services revenue over the service period which is typically one year from the date the endcustomer registers for these services the date on which the services can first be used by the customer although it could be longer as we are experiencing growth in sales of multiyear support and subscription contracts sales of new and renewal services increase our deferred revenue balance which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations 

  

key metrics 

  

we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies our total deferred revenue increased by 507 million from 2019 million at december 31 2009 to 2526 million at december 31 2010  revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period is a useful metric that management identifies as billings billings for services drive deferred revenue which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business and has historically represented a majority of the revenue that we recognize in a typical quarter we also ended fiscal 2010 with 3875 million in cash cash equivalents and investments and have had positive cash flow from operations every fiscal year since 2005 we discuss revenue gross margin and the components of operating income and margin below under “components of operating results” and we discuss our cash cash equivalents and investments under “liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue and cash flow from operations are discussed immediately below the following table 

  



  

deferred revenue our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from subscription and support service contracts we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods 

  

cash provided by operating activities we monitor cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance our cash provided by operating activities is driven in large part by advance payments for both new and 

renewal contracts for subscription and support services monitoring cash provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the noncash effects of certain items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expenses thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business our cash provided by operating activities was 1034 million in fiscal 2010  620 million in fiscal 2009  and 377 million in fiscal 2008  in fiscal 2010 free cash flow a nongaap financial measure described under nongaap financial measures below was 996 million  compared to 574 million in fiscal 2009 and 349 million in fiscal 2008 

  

nongaap financial measures 

  

to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap we consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap including nongaap gross margin nongaap income from operations and nongaap operating margin nongaap operating expenses nongaap net income and nongaap free cash flow these nongaap financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies nongaap gross margin is gross margin as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense which is a noncash charge and for fiscal 2009 only noncash asset acquisition related writeoffs nongaap income from operations is operating income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of stockbased compensation expense and for fiscal 2009 only noncash asset acquisition related writeoffs the noncash asset acquisition related writeoffs that we exclude from our fiscal 2009 nongaap financial measures are charges for intangible assets that have no future value but these charges do not include amortization related to the intangible assets that provide an ongoing benefit to our recurring operations nongaap operating margin is nongaap income from operations divided by revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude the impact of stockbased compensation expense nongaap net income is net income plus stockbased compensation expense and noncash asset acquisition related writeoffs less the related tax effects free cash flow an alternative nongaap measure of liquidity is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 

  

we use these nongaap financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to gaap measures in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance as they help illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in these nongaap financial measures furthermore we use many of these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we also believe that the use of these nongaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry many of which present similar nongaap financial measures to investors 

  

these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap there are a number of limitations related to the use of these nongaap financial measures versus the nearest gaap equivalent of these financial measures first these nongaap financial measures exclude certain recurring noncash charges namely stockbased compensation expense stockbased compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and is an important part of our employees compensation that reflects their performance second the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the expenses if any that our peer companies may exclude when they report their results of operations we compensate for these limitations by providing the nearest gaap equivalents of these nongaap financial measures and describing these gaap equivalents in our results of operations below 

  

the following tables reconcile gaap gross margin income from operations operating margin certain operating expenses and net income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations to nongaap gross margin nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin certain nongaap operating expenses and nongaap net income for fiscal 2010  2009 and 2008 for fiscal 2010 both gaap and nongaap results below include approximately 13 million of payroll tax expense resulting from the exercise of employee stock options during the year payroll tax expense associated with stock option exercises during fiscal 2009 and 2008 was immaterial 

  

  



  



  



 

1 stockbased compensation expense and noncash asset acquisition related writeoffs are added back to gaap net income to reconcile to nongaap income before taxes 

2 provision for income taxes is our gaap provision that must be added to gaap net income to reconcile to nongaap income before taxes the provision for fiscal 2009 included a 378 million tax benefit from the reversal of our valuation allowance 

3 we used a 32 effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 to calculate nongaap net income for fiscal 2010 the 32 effective tax rate reflects the exclusion of gaap based stock option benefits as well as the reinstated federal rd credit our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 18 which reflects only our foreign tax provision as our us operations had net operating losses to offset any taxable income 

  



  



  

components of operating results 

  

revenue 

  

we derive our revenue from sales of our products and subscription and support services in fiscal 2010 we recognized our revenue in accordance with the guidance in asc 98560525 formerly referred to as statement of position or sop 972 software revenue recognition and sop 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions which is discussed in further detail in “—critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below according to asc 98560525 revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 

  

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

  

 42 

majority of our product revenue has been generated by our fortigate line of appliances and we do not expect this to change in the foreseeable future product revenue also includes revenue derived from sales of fortimanager and fortianalyzer as well as some of our other products we generally recognize revenue for products sold to distributors under the “sellin” method upon shipment to the distributor and for “sellthrough” distributors upon sale to their endcustomer as a percentage of total revenue we expect our product revenue may vary from quartertoquarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors discussed below under “—quarterly results of operations” but generally may remain at relatively comparable levels 

  

   

   

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

  

   

   

   

gross profit  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products any excess inventory writeoffs manufacturing costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services we believe our overall gross margin for the near term will remain at comparable levels or decline modestly compared to that achieved in fiscal 2010 

  

services revenue has historically increased as a percentage of total revenue since inception and this trend has had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher services gross margins compared to product gross margins we have generally maintained consistent services gross margins in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 

  

operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of cashbased personnel costs such as salaries benefits bonuses and with regard to the sales and marketing expense sales commissions they also include noncash charges specifically stockbased compensation we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees 

  

   

   

   

interest income interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities and us government debt securities 

  

other income expense net  other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange and related hedging gains and losses foreign exchange gains and losses relate to foreign currency exchange remeasurement the hedging gains and losses are related to our settled balance sheet hedges 

  

provision for income taxes we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than us tax rates and may be subject to current us income taxes our effective tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the us research and development tax credits particularly the recently reinstated us federal research and development tax credit withholding taxes nondeductible compensation and expenses and adjustments related to our intercompany transfer pricing 

  

the income tax provision for fiscal 2010 was comprised primarily of domestic income taxes foreign income taxes and withholding taxes the 2010 effective tax rate was impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries as well as the reinstated us federal research and development tax credit the income tax provision for fiscal 2009 reflected a tax benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance which resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets for periods beginning in 2010 as a result of fully reversing our valuation allowance we expect that our effective tax rate will approximate the us federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes research and development tax credits when applicable withholding tax nondeductible compensation and adjustments related to intercompany transfer pricing 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation valuation of inventory warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these 

estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

  

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to the financial statements included in this 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we derive revenue from sales of products including appliances and software and services including subscription support and other services our appliances include operating system software that is integrated into the appliance hardware and is deemed essential to its functionality as a result we account for revenue in accordance with asc 985605 and all related interpretations see “—recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements” for a discussion of new revenue recognition standards that we will be required to adopt for fiscal 2011 we are still assessing the impact of the new standards and have not reflected in this annual report any impact such standards may have on our consolidated financial statements 

  

no revenue can be recognized until all of the following criteria have been met 

  

   

   

   

   

for arrangements that include customer acceptance criteria no revenue is recognized prior to acceptance we recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no rights of return and endcustomers upon shipment of the appliance once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we also make sales through distributors under agreements that allow for rights of return we recognize product revenue on sales made through such distributors upon sale by the distributor to the endcustomer at which time rights of return generally lapse substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with subscription or support services subscription services provide access to our antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades maintenance releases and patches telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 

  

we commence our subscription and support services on the date the customer registers the appliance the customer is then entitled to service for the stated contractual period beginning on the registration date 

  

we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue in cases where vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements does not exist typically for subscription and support services revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the performance period of the undelivered elements revenue related to these arrangements is included in ratable product and services revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing for those services when sold separately revenue for professional services and training is recognized upon completion of the related services 

  

we offer certain sales incentives to channel partners additionally in limited circumstances we may permit endcustomers distributors and resellers to return our products subject to varying limitations for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances we estimate and record reserves for these sales incentives and sales returns based on our historical experience in each accounting period we must 

make judgments and estimates of sales incentives and potential future sales returns related to current period revenue these estimates affect our net revenue line item on our consolidated statement of operations and affect our net accounts receivable deferred revenue or accrued liabilities line items on our consolidated balance sheet historically there have been no significant adjustments to these estimates related to prior periods 

  

at december 31 2010  our allowance for sales returns was 20 million compared to 50 million at december 31 2009  the decrease was the result of improved efficiency in processing sales incentives through the system at period end if our allowance for sales returns was to increase by 10 or 02 million  our net revenue would decrease by 02 million for fiscal 2010 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

employees we have accounted for stockbased awards to employees in accordance with asc 718 sfas 123r which requires compensation expense related to sharebased transactions including employee stock options to be measured and recognized in the financial statements based on a determination of the fair value of the stock options the grant date fair value is determined using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model for all employee stock options we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility expected term and forfeiture rate any changes in these highly subjective assumptions significantly impact stockbased compensation expense 

  

nonemployees during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 we issued to nonemployees in exchange for services options to purchase shares of common stock these options vest over periods of up to 48 months and in accordance with asc 50550 formerly referred to as emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9618 we accounted for these options as variable awards the options were valued using the blackscholes option pricing model 

  

valuation of inventory 

  

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record additional inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

  

warranty liabilities 

  

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on hardware products and a 90day warranty on software a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is charged to cost of product revenue based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our gross margin could be adversely affected 

  

accounting for income taxes 

  

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in estimating future tax consequences generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

  

we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities we provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed more likely than not that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 

  

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc 74010 fin 48 which defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements asc 74010 requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting 

date we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

  

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the future we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets as a result we released all of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

  

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted 

  

results of operations 

  

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 

  



 

   



  

fiscal years 2010 and 2009 

  

revenue 

  



  

total revenue increased 726 million  or 288  in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009  the americas region contributed the largest portion of this growth product revenue increased 365 million  or 369  compared to fiscal 2009  the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by higher product sales volume across all regions when looking at the mix of product revenue there was a greater mix of our highend products due to increased sales to enterprise and service provider customers as evidenced by a 79 increase in the number of 500000 deals in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 services revenue increased 329 million  or 236  in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to the recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base and our increased focus on contract renewals the growth in services revenue tends to lag growth in billings and product revenue due to amortization of revenue over the service period the growth in ratable product and services revenue was due to a slight decrease in the weightedaverage service period as a result of a decrease in the average contractual term of support contracts for arrangements in which we recognized product and services revenue ratably 

  

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



  

total gross margin increased 16 percentage points in fiscal 2010 primarily due to improved product margins in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009  product gross margin increased 43 percentage points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a greater mix of our highend products and the absence of asset acquisition related writeoffs compared to a 24 million writeoff in fiscal 2009 from time to time we have experienced sales of previously reserved inventory during fiscal 2010 we experienced a positive impact of 07 percentage points due to the sale of fully reserved inventory compared to a positive impact of 11 percentage points in fiscal 2009 services gross margin was relatively flat as we continued to make investments in our americas support professional services and fortiguard global security research organizations services cost increased by 47 million primarily due to a 29 million increase in cashbased personnel costs related to headcount increases travel depreciation and other expenses increased a combined 08 million in addition occupancyrelated costs increased 07 million and stockbased compensation increased 03 million ratable product and services gross margin increased 29 percentage points as a result of leverage achieved from cost reductions with respect to overhead 

  

operating expenses 

  



  

research and development expense 

  

research and development expense increased 76 million  or 180  in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase of 52 million in cashbased personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support continued enhancements of our products higher occupancyrelated costs of 17 million due to a move into a new office facility in vancouver with significantly increased square footage plus early termination and moving costs an increase of 04 million in stockbased compensation expense and an increase of 03 million in product development related expenses such as nonrecurring engineering nre testing and certifications a 10 increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate against the us dollar also significantly contributed to the increase in research and development expenses 

  

sales and marketing expense 

  

sales and marketing expense increased 157 million  or 163  in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 as we continued to increase our sales headcount in order to expand our global footprint the increase consisted of cashbased personnel costs of 145 million as a result of increased headcount a 13 million increase in travel as a result of our overall sales growth of 29 and particularly sales growth in the americas of 34 a 08 million increase in stockbased compensation expense and a 02 million increase in professional services these increases were partially offset by a 11 million decrease in marketingrelated expenses as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased 37 percentage points due to the leverage we are achieving from the investment in our salesforce during the past year as evidenced by revenue growth of 29 exceeding sales and marketing expenses growth of 16 

  

general and administrative expense 

  

in fiscal 2010  general and administrative expense increased 41 million  or 222  compared to fiscal 2009  the increase was primarily due to a 18 million increase in legal expenses to support various patent litigation matters and a 06 million increase in accountingrelated expenses due to being a public company in addition cashbased personnel costs increased 13 million and stockbased compensation expense increased 04 million  

  

interest income and other income expense net 

  



  

the 02 million decrease in interest income in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to lower interest rates earned despite higher balances of cash cash equivalents and investments the change in other income expense net for fiscal 2010 when compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of foreign exchange losses in fiscal 2010 due to the weakening of the us dollar against the australian dollar chinese yuan and japanese yen 

  

provision for benefit from income taxes 

  



 

not meaningful 

  

our effective tax rate was 268 for fiscal 2010  compared with an effective tax rate of negative 1187 for fiscal 2009  the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2010 is comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes the 2010 effective tax rate is impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries as well as the reinstated us federal research and development tax credit the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 reflected the release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in fiscal 2009 we generated pretax income in fiscal 2009 and 2008 as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected future taxable income we reversed approximately 442 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2009 after having determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized this reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit totaling 378 million our estimates of future taxable income represent critical accounting estimates because such estimates are subject to change and a downward adjustment could have a significant impact on future earnings furthermore we continue to evaluate our net deferred tax asset position in regards to the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 

  

fiscal years 2009 and 2008 

  

revenue 

  



  

total revenue increased 403 million  or 190  in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008  primarily due to growth in services revenue the americas and emea regions contributed the largest portion of this growth product revenue increased 41 million  or 43  compared to fiscal 2008  the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by higher product sales volume predominantly in the americas region as we expanded our distributor base to include those that focus on high volume sales of entrylevel products while there were no material price changes between the periods the shift in product mix towards our entrylevel products had the effect of decreasing our average sales price services revenue increased 339 million  or 322  in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base the increase in services revenue also reflects additional services revenue amortization of approximately 16 million due to our reporting period transition discussed above the growth in ratable product and services revenue was due to a slight decrease in the weightedaverage service period over which such revenue was recognized due to a decrease in the average contractual term of support contracts for arrangements in which we recognized product and services revenue ratably over the performance period 

  

cost of revenue and gross margin 

  



  

total gross margin increased 31 percentage points in fiscal 2009 primarily due to improved product and service margins and a higher mix of services revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 product gross margin increased 11 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower warrantyrelated return costs which resulted in a savings of 32 million partially offset by 24 million of asset acquisition related writeoffs the 25 percentage point 

increase in services gross margin was primarily due to growth in services revenue resulting from a larger customer base to leverage our support cost structure services cost increased 28 million primarily due to 20 million of higher cashbased personnel costs related to headcount increases in our professional services and training teams and an increase of 03 million in stockbased compensation expense ratable product and services gross margin was unchanged in the period 

  

operating expenses 

  



  

research and development expense 

  

research and development expense increased 52 million  or 139  in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008  primarily due to an increase of 37 million in cashbased personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support continued enhancements of our products we also had an increase of 09 million in stockbased compensation expense an increase of 02 million in depreciation expense and 02 million in supplies and other expenses 

  

sales and marketing expense 

  

sales and marketing expense increased 86 million  or 98  in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008  primarily due to increased cashbased personnel costs of 54 million based on increased headcount primarily in the us a 13 million increase in promotional and other marketingrelated expenses a 04 million increase in travel a 04 million increase in depreciation costs and a 05 million increase in stockbased compensation expense offset by a 05 million decrease in rent and occupancyrelated expenses as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased 32 percentage points 

  

general and administrative expense 

  

in fiscal 2009 general and administrative expense increased 17 million or 101 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily due to a 09 million increase in external legal services a 05 million increase in accountingrelated services a 05 million increase in rent and occupancyrelated expenses and a 04 million increase in stockbased compensation expense these increases were partially offset by a 05 million decrease in computer related supplies and a 02 million decrease in travel expenses 

  

interest income and other income expense net 

  



  

the 06 million decrease in interest income in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was due to lower interest rates earned despite higher balances of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the change in other income expense net for fiscal 2009 was the result of a stronger us dollar compared to the euro british pound and the canadian dollar in 2008 when compared to 2009 

  

provision for benefit from income taxes 

  



 

not meaningful 

  

our effective tax rate was negative 1187 for fiscal 2009  compared to an effective tax rate of 204 for fiscal 2008  the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2009 is comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes as well as the release of the valuation allowance the decrease in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was attributable to the release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets we generated pretax income in fiscal 2009 and 2008 as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected future taxable income we reversed approximately 442 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal 2009 after having determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized this reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit totaling 378 million 

  

quarterly results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight fiscal quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

  

our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products subscriptions and services in general a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend has positively impacted sales activity in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential billings and product revenues which results in lower product revenue our product revenue in the third quarter can be negatively affected by reduced economic activity in europe during the summer months during fiscal 2010 the growth in the americas during the third quarter more than offset the slight decline in europe but this may not always be the case similarly our gross margins and operating income have been affected by these historical trends because expenses are relatively fixed in the nearterm although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of a quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

  

our total quarterly revenue over the past twelve quarters has increased sequentially in every quarter except for the first quarters of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 we believe these declines in the first and third quarters of fiscal 2010 are based on seasonality as discussed above which particularly impacts our product revenue product revenue in all of the quarters of fiscal 2010 was higher as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2009  which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales organization and improvements in overall corporate it spending 



  

quarterly gross margin trend 

  

gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products product gross margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 decreased due to asset acquisition related costs of 17 million services gross margins have increased or remained relatively flat with minor fluctuations from the first quarter of fiscal 2009 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 due to higher revenue and a larger customer base over which to spread related costs we experienced a slight decrease in services gross margins during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and first two quarters of fiscal 2010 due to an increase in headcount as we invested in support personnel 



  



  

liquidity and capital resources 

  



  

at december 31 2010  our cash cash equivalents and investments of 3875 million were held for workingcapital purposes and were invested primarily in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities and us government debt securities we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

  



 

   

operating activities 

  

in fiscal 2010  operating activities provided 1034 million in cash as a result of our strong performance primarily driven by billings growth profitability and the ability to successfully manage our working capital net income was 412 million  increased by noncash adjustments of 166 million and sources of cash of 731 million partially offset by uses of cash of 275 million  noncash adjustments consist of stockbased compensation expense of 93 million  amortization of investment premiums of 73 million  and depreciation and amortization of 57 million  partially offset by an excess tax benefit from employee stock option plans of 57 million sources of cash were related to a 507 million increase in deferred revenue which was attributable primarily to increased sales of our subscription and support services which have yet to be recognized in income an 117 million increase in income tax payable and deferred tax assets due to our continued profitability and timing of tax payments cash paid for taxes was 25 million a 55 million increase in accrued payroll and compensation primarily related to increased headcount and employer taxes related to the exercise of stock options a 48 million increase in accrued liabilities and accounts payable related to timing of payments and a 04 million decrease in deferred cost of revenues uses of cash were related to a 178 million increase in accounts receivable due to the overall growth of our business with days sales outstanding remaining flat 70 days a 59 million increase in inventory primarily to support new product releases in the latter part of the year combined with the overall growth of our business and a 38 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets days sales outstanding is calculated as the ratio of ending accounts receivable net of allowances divided by average daily sales for the preceding 90 days 

in fiscal 2009 operating activities provided 620 million in cash as a result of net income of 602 million  decreased by noncash adjustments of 152 million  increased by sources of cash of 361 million and partially offset by uses of cash of 192 million noncash adjustments consist of a tax benefit from the release of our valuation allowance of 302 million and excess tax benefit from employee stock option plans of 16 million  offset by stockbased compensation of 75 million  depreciation and amortization of 59 million  writeoff of intangible assets of 24 million  and amortization of investment premiums of 08 million  sources of cash were related to a 303 million increase in deferred revenue which was attributable primarily to increased sales of our subscription and support services a 52 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments and a 06 million increase in accrued payroll and compensation primarily related to increased headcount uses of cash were related to an 85 million increase in accounts receivable due to the overall growth of our business with days sales outstanding remaining flat 69 days a 70 million decrease in income tax payable and deferred tax assets a 20 million increase in inventory a 11 million increase in deferred cost of revenues and a 06 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets

investing activities 

  

in fiscal 2010 our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of investments and to a much lesser extent capital expenditures the 2837 million of cash used by investing activities was due to net purchases of investments of 2800 million reflecting primarily the transfer of funds from money market to corporate bonds agency notes and commercial paper during the period this was offset by 38 million used for capital expenditures 

in fiscal 2009 our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of investments associated with our investment balances and capital expenditures the 138 million of cash provided by investing activities was due primarily to net maturities of shortterm investments of 189 million additionally we used cash of 46 million for capital expenditures and 05 million for the purchase of certain technology assets 

in fiscal 2008 the 537 million of cash used in investing activities was due primarily to 488 million in net purchases of investments additionally we used cash of 28 million for capital expenditures 10 million for the purchase of assets from iplocks and 10 million for the purchase of certain other technology assets 

  

financing activities 

  

in fiscal 2010 our financing activities resulted in net cash provided of 340 million as a result of receiving proceeds of 291 million from the exercise of stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock and an excess tax benefit from employee stock option plans of 58 million related to option exercises partially offset by 09 million of issuance costs paid in connection with our initial public offering which had been accrued as of december 31 2009 

  

in fiscal 2009 our financing activities resulted in net cash provided of 780 million as a result of receiving proceeds of 915 million net of issuance costs paid of 33 million from the sale of common stock in connection with our initial public offering in november 2009 in addition we received proceeds of 40 million from the exercise of stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock and had an in excess tax benefit from employee stock option plans of 16 million all partially offset by 158 million related to the repurchase of our preferred and common stock in the first half of fiscal 2009 

  

in fiscal 2008 our financing activities related to proceeds of 21 million as a result of exercises of stock options to purchase our common stock 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010  

  



 

 including interest related to uncertain tax positions because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

during fiscal 2010  2009 and 2008  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate fluctuation risk 

  

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper money market funds government and corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit the risk associated with fluctuating interest 

rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2010  2009 and 2008 would have resulted in a decrease in our interest income of approximately 02 million 02 million and 03 million respectively 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the us are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar cad euro eur british pound gbp and japanese yen jpy to help protect against significant fluctuations in the value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to hedge balance sheet items denominated in eur gbp and cad and occasionally to hedge future forecasted cash outflows denominated in eur we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions and we monitor the creditworthiness of these parties these contracts typically have maturities between one and three months we account for our hedges under asc 815 derivatives and hedging  we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts as other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations gains or losses resulting from settled forward exchange contracts related to future forecasted cash outflows are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations in the same period the hedged items occur gains or losses resulting from unsettled forward exchange contracts related to future forecasted cash outflows are recorded in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet we recognized an expense of 08 million in other income expense net in fiscal 2010 due to foreign currency transaction losses 

  

our hedging activities are intended to reduce but not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements as our hedging activities are relatively shortterm in nature longterm material changes in the value of the us dollar versus the eur gbp cad or jpy could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future 

  

inflation risk 

  

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us

in addition to providing network and content level security fortios also offers system virtualization capabilities—the ability to “divide” a security appliance into multiple separately provisioned and managed instances this capability is currently deployed in substantially all of our fortigate products as our virtual domain or vdom feature where administrators have the ability to segment a single fortigate appliance platform into multiple fortigate instances network security system virtualization using our vdom feature provides isolation between each virtual system giving administrators flexibility in configuration and traffic management capabilities for each virtual instance for example for a service provider that is delivering managed security services to multiple customers each customer of the service provider may require a tailored set of security services that suits their specific network requirements to accomplish this the service provider could use our fortigate virtualization feature to partition one fortigate blade or appliance into hundreds of instances customizing each instance for each customer this ensures that each of their customers’ networks is separate and private with unique routing management and policy enforcement by implementing virtualization each customer of a security service provider has the ability to refine its requirements to meet its specific goals the virtualization of our fortigate functionality lowers capital and operational expenditures for enterprises and service providers and simplifies administration and management

sales and marketing 

we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers who in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to government focused resellers very large service providers and major systems integrator partners who have large purchasing power and unique customer deployment demands as of december 31 2009 our distribution channel program had approximately 5000 channel partners worldwide we work with many of the world’s leading technology distributors including arrow electronics inc ingram micro inc and tech data corporation 

we support our channel partners with a team of experienced channel account managers sales professionals and sales engineers who provide business planning joint marketing strategy and presales and operational sales support additionally our sales team often helps drive and support large enterprise and service provider sales through a direct touch model our sales professionals and engineers typically work alongside our channel partners and directly engage with endcustomers to address their unique security and deployment requirements our sales cycle for an initial endcustomer purchase typically ranges from three to six months but can be longer especially for large enterprises service providers and government customers to support our broadly dispersed global channel and endcustomer base we have sales offices in over 30 countries around the world 

  

our marketing strategy is focused on building our brand and driving endcustomer demand for our security solutions we execute this strategy by leveraging a combination of internal marketing professionals and a network of regional and global channel partners our internal marketing organization is responsible for branding product marketing channel marketing and sales support programs we focus our resources on programs tools and activities that can be leveraged by partners worldwide to extend our marketing reach such as sales tools and collateral product awards and technical certifications training regional seminars and conferences webinars and various other demandgeneration activities 

manufacturing and suppliers 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers our current manufacturing partners include flextronics international ltd micro star international ltd creation technologies inc and a number of additional taiwanbased manufacturers we submit purchase orders to our contract manufacturers that describe the type and quantities of our products to be manufactured the delivery date and other delivery terms once our products are manufactured they are sent to either our headquarters in sunnyvale california or to our logistics partner in taoyuan city taiwan where accessory packaging and qualitycontrol testing are performed we use one thirdparty logistics provider that accounted for a material portion of our shipments in fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2009 we believe that outsourcing our manufacturing and a substantial portion of our logistics enables us to conserve capital better adjust manufacturing volumes to meet changes in demand and more quickly deliver products while allowing us to focus resources on our core competencies our proprietary fortiasic which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and tsmc faraday using umc’s foundry and kmicro using tsmc’s foundry manufacture our asics on a purchase order basis accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for the fabrication of our asics could be increased on short notice 

the components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by us or more frequently by our contract manufacturers some of the components important to our business including central processing units from intel amd rmi and via and network chips from broadcom marvell and intel are available from a limited or sole source of supply 

we have no longterm contracts related to the manufacturing of our asics or other components that guarantee any capacity or pricing terms 

research and development 

we focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and systems and adding new features to existing products and systems our development strategy is to identify features products and systems for both software and hardware that are or are expected to be needed by our endcustomers our success in designing developing manufacturing and selling new or enhanced products will depend on a variety of factors including the identification of market demand for new products product selection timely implementation of product design and development product performance effective manufacturing and assembly processes and sales and marketing 

as of december 31 2009 our research and development organization had headcount of 412 people predominantly in canada china and the united states our research and development expense in fiscal 2009 was 422 million in fiscal 2008 was 370 million and in fiscal 2007 was 276 million 

intellectual property 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology as of december 31 2009 we had 35 issued us patents 5 issued chinese patents 96 patent applications pending for examination in the united states and 26 patent applications pending for examination in china 19 of which are related to us applications we purchased most of our issued us patents and many of our pending us patent applications from other entities we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states 

  

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in particular leading companies in the networking industry have extensive patent portfolios from timetotime third parties including certain of these leading companies have asserted and may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our endcustomers successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights royalties or other fees even if third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected we typically indemnify our endcustomers distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties 

competition 

the markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our competitors include networking companies such as cisco systems inc and juniper networks inc security vendors such as check point software technologies ltd mcafee inc and sonicwall inc and other point solution security vendors 

we believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance reliability and breadth and our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and based on our technological expertise several competitors are significantly larger have greater financial technical marketing distribution customer support and other resources are more established than we are and have significantly better brand recognition some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products based in part on these competitive pressures we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality 

  

conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete our competitors may introduce products that are less costly provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products in addition our larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market the above competitive pressures are likely to continue to adversely impact our business we may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competition may harm our business 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 our total headcount was 1223 people including payrolled contractors we had 412 in research and development 417 in sales and marketing 249 in services and support 40 in manufacturing operations and 105 in a general and administrative capacity as of december 31 2009 our headcount was 288 people in the united states 386 in canada 79 in france 216 in china and 254 in other countries 

none of our us employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us however our employees in france spain and italy are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

 item 1a risk factors tableend investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes before investing in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material also may become important factors that affect us if any of the following risks materialize our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose some or all of your investment 

  

risks related to our business 

our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable 

our operating results have historically varied from period to period and we expect that they will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results this variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our revenue or operating results expectations or those of securities analysts or investors for any period if we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our shares could fall substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in addition a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends accordingly in the event of revenue shortfalls we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term 

reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue to fall below expected levels 

as a result of customerbuying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed quarterly quotas historically we have received a substantial portion of a quarter’s sales orders and generated a substantial portion of a quarter’s revenue during the last two weeks or last days of the quarter if expected revenue at the end of any quarter is delayed for any reason including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize our or our logistics partners’ inability to ship products prior to quarterend to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter our failure to manage inventory properly in a way to meet demand or our inability to release new products on schedule our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

we have a history of losses and may not maintain profitability and our revenue growth may not continue 

we have incurred net losses in most fiscal years since our inception including net losses of 218 million in fiscal 2007 53 million in fiscal 2006 142 million in fiscal 2005 and 590 million in fiscal 2004 as a result we had an accumulated deficit of 600 million at december 31 2009 although we were profitable in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 we may not be able to sustain profitability in future periods if we fail to increase revenue or deferred revenue manage our cost structure or are subject to unanticipated liabilities revenue growth may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons including slowing demand for our products or services increasing competition a decrease in the growth of our overall market or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities any failure by us to maintain profitability and continue our revenue growth could cause the price of our common stock to materially decline 

  

we rely significantly on revenue from subscription and support services which may decline and because we recognize revenue from subscriptions and support services over the term of the relevant service period downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results 

our services revenue accounted for 552 of our total revenue for fiscal 2009 497 of our total revenue for fiscal 2008 and 477 of our total revenue for fiscal 2007 sales of new or renewal subscription and services contracts may decline and fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including endcustomers’ level of satisfaction with our products and services the prices of our products and services the prices of products and services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers’ spending levels if our sales of new or renewal subscription and services contracts decline our revenue and revenue growth may decline and our business will suffer in addition we recognize subscription and service revenue monthly over the term of the relevant service period which is typically one year but has been as long as five years as a result much of the revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of deferred revenue from subscription and services contracts entered into during previous quarters consequently a decline in new or renewed subscription or service contracts in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters accordingly the effect of significant downturns in new or renewed sales of our subscriptions or services is not reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods our subscription and service revenue also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional service sales in any period as revenue from new and renewal service contracts must be recognized over the applicable service period 

managing inventory of our products and product components is complex insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

our channel partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high return product or take advantage of price protection if any or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in endcustomer demand management of our inventory is further complicated by the significant number of different products that we sell and the fact that we sell models that must meet regulatory requirements such as the european union’s restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive or the eu rohs 

  

in addition for those channel partners that have rights of return inventory held by such channel partners affects our results of operations our inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to effectively manage inventory inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain inventory levels that are sufficient to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins for example in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 we had excess inventory resulting in significant inventory writeoffs alternatively insufficient inventory levels which we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential endcustomers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and that of our distribution partners our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we rely on thirdparty channel partners to generate substantially all of our revenue if our partners fail to perform our ability to sell our products and services will be limited and if we fail to optimize our channel partner model going forward our operating results will be harmed 

substantially all of our revenue is generated through sales by our channel partners which include distributors and resellers we depend upon our channel partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process to the extent our channel partners are unsuccessful in selling our products or we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of high quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and operating results will be harmed 

we provide sales channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our products but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services our channel partners generally do not have minimum purchase requirements they may also market sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing sales and support of such products they may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own they may cease selling our products altogether we cannot assure you that we will retain these channel partners or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or the failure to obtain and ship a number of large orders each quarter through them could harm our operating results during fiscal 2007 2008 and 2009 alternative technology inc a subsidiary of arrow electronics inc was our most significant channel partner accounting for 12 of our total revenue in each of the periods any new sales channel partner will require extensive training and may take several months or more to achieve productivity our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to endcustomers or our channel partners violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to manage existing sales channels our business will be seriously harmed 

if we are not successful in continuing to execute our strategy to increase our sales to larger endcustomers our results of operations may suffer 

an important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our products to large enterprises service providers and government entities sales to enterprises service providers and government entities involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smalltomidsized entities these risks include 

 

  

  

  

   

large enterprises service providers and government entities often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle in some cases over 12 months although we have a channel sales model our sales representatives typically engage in direct interaction with our distributors and resellers in connection with sales to larger endcustomers due to the lengthy nature the size and scope and stringent requirements of these evaluations we typically provide evaluation products to these customers we may spend substantial time effort and money in our sales efforts without being successful in producing any sales if we are unsuccessful in converting these evaluations into sales we may experience an increased inventory of used products and potentially increased writeoffs in addition product purchases by enterprises service providers and government entities are frequently subject to budget constraints multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays finally enterprise service providers and government entities typically have longer implementation cycles require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers if sales expected from a large endcustomer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the average sales prices of our products may decrease which may reduce our gross profits 

the average sales prices for our products may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts we offer a change in our mix of products anticipation of the introduction of new products or promotional programs competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product offerings may reduce the price of products that compete with ours in order to promote the sale of other products or may bundle them with other products furthermore we anticipate that the average sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis or that our product offerings if introduced will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 

defects or vulnerabilities in our products or services the failure of our products or services to prevent a virus or security breach or misuse of our products could harm our reputation and divert resources 

because our products and services are complex they have contained and may contain defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers for example one of our highend product models has been experiencing a defect in limited deployments defects or vulnerabilities 

  

may impede or block network traffic or cause our products or services to be vulnerable to electronic breakins or cause them to fail to help secure networks because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition defects or errors in our fortiguard subscription updates or our fortigate appliances could result in a failure of our fortiguard services to effectively update endcustomers’ fortigate appliances and thereby leave customers vulnerable to attacks furthermore our solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our fortiguard databases in time to protect our endcustomers’ networks our fortiguard or forticare data centers and networks may also experience technical failures and downtime and may fail to distribute appropriate updates or fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base any such technical failure downtime or failures in general may temporarily or permanently expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats 

an actual or perceived security breach or infection of the network of one of our endcustomers regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our products or services to prevent the security breach could adversely affect the market’s perception of our security products we may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly or at all our products may also be misused by endcustomers or third parties who obtain access to our products for example our products could be used to censor private access to certain information on the internet such use of our products for censorship could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation even if we take reasonable measures to prevent any improper shipment of our products or if our products are provided by an unauthorized thirdparty any defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or misuse of our products could result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our operating results will be negatively affected 

we have a high volume business that has grown over the last several years we rely heavily on information technology systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing revenue recognition financial forecasts and inventory and supply chain management however we have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions like electronic data interchange which could have a negative impact on our business for example a large part of our order processing relies on the manual processing of emails from our customers combined with the fact that we may receive a majority of our orders in the last few weeks of any given quarter a significant interruption in our email service could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that quarter to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure operating and administrative systems and controls and continue to manage headcount capital and processes in an efficient manner we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate in the intended manner may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings or to prevent certain losses our productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation valuation of inventory warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes 

we offer retroactive price protection to certain of our major distributors and if we fail to balance their inventory with endcustomer demand for our products our allowance for price protection may be inadequate which could adversely affect our results of operations 

we provide certain of our major distributors with price protection rights for inventories of our products held by them if we reduce the list price of our products certain distributors receive refunds or credits from us that reduce the price of such products held in their inventory based upon the new list price as of december 31 2009 we estimated that approximately 16 million of our products in our distributors’ inventory were subject to price protection future credits for price protection will depend on the percentage of our price reductions for the products in inventory and our ability to manage the levels of our major distributors’ inventories if future price protection adjustments are higher than expected our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business will suffer 

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel the loss of the services of any of our key personnel the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel particularly in engineering and sales may seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations we have experienced turnover in our managementlevel personnel none of our key employees has an employment agreement for a specific term and any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be critical to our future success competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense especially in the locations where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel the san francisco bay area vancouver canada and beijing china a large portion of our employee base is substantially vested in significant stock option grants and the ability to exercise those options and sell their stock may result in a larger than normal turnover rate we may not be successful in attracting assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information 

  

we are dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations the loss of services of senior management particularly ken xie our cofounder president and chief executive officer michael xie our cofounder vice president of engineering and chief technical officer and ken goldman our vice president and chief financial officer could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives in addition key personnel may be distracted by activities unrelated to our business the loss of the services or distraction of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to establish fair value for any undelivered element of a customer order revenue relating to the entire order will be deferred and recognized over future periods a delay in the recognition of revenue for a significant portion of our sales in a particular quarter may adversely affect our results of operations 

in the course of our selling efforts we typically enter into arrangements that require us to deliver a combination of products and services we refer to each individual product or service as an “element” of the overall arrangement these arrangements typically require us to deliver particular elements in a future period as we discuss further in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” if we are unable to determine the fair value of any undelivered elements we are required by generally accepted accounting principles or gaap to defer revenue from the entire arrangement rather than just the undelivered elements if we are required to defer revenue from the entire arrangement for a significant portion of our product sales our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations or those of securities analysts and investors adversely affecting our results of operations and resulting in a decline in our stock price 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business 

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in addition the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources we believe the current global economic downturn may have adversely affected our total revenue in fiscal 2009 continued weak global economic conditions or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth 

because we depend on several thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time if at all and may result in the loss of sales and customers 

we outsource the manufacturing of our security appliance products to a variety of contract manufacturing partners and original design manufacturing partners 

our reliance on our thirdparty manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs and product supply any manufacturing disruption by our thirdparty manufacturers could impair our ability to fulfill orders if we are unable to manage our relationships with these thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays disruptions capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired and our business would be seriously harmed 

these manufacturers fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual purchase orders we have no longterm contracts or arrangements with certain of our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice if we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers would be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins our individual product lines are generally manufactured by only one manufacturing partner any production interruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would severely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner 

  

our proprietary fortiasic which is the key to the performance of our appliances is fabricated by contract manufacturers in foundries operated by umc and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation or tsmc faraday using umc’s foundry and kmicro using tsmc’s foundry manufacture our asics on a purchase order basis and these foundries do not guarantee any capacity and could reject orders from either faraday or kmicro or try to increase pricing accordingly the foundries are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements and due to the long lead time that a new foundry would require we could suffer temporary or long term inventory shortages of our fortiasic as well as increased costs our suppliers may also prioritize orders by other companies that order higher volumes of products if any of these suppliers materially delays its supply of asics or specific product models to us or requires us to find an alternate supplier and we are not able to do so on a timely and reasonable basis or if these foundries materially increase their prices for fabrication of our asics or specific product models our business would be harmed 

in addition our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers and foundries limits our control over environmental regulatory requirements such as the hazardous substance content of our products and therefore our ability to ensure compliance with the eu rohs and other similar laws see “if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected” for information on the effects of the failure to comply with these laws 

because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers and may result in the loss of sales and customers 

we and our contract manufacturers currently purchase several key parts and components used in the manufacture of our products from limited sources of supply we are therefore subject to the risk of shortages in the supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products we have faced component shortages in the past certain of our limited source components for particular appliances and suppliers of those components include specific types of central processing units from intel corporation advanced micro devices inc rmi corporation and via technologies inc and network chips from broadcom corporation marvell technology group ltd and intel the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their products particularly if not anticipated by us or our contract manufacturers could require us to expend significant resources to incorporate these new components into our products in addition if these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component we would be required to expend significant resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor qualifying additional suppliers for limited source parts or components can be timeconsuming and expensive 

  

our manufacturing partners have experienced increasing lead times for the purchase of components incorporated into our products our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several additional risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the occurrence of any of these would be disruptive to us and could seriously harm our business any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our distributors resellers and endcustomers this could harm our relationships with our channel partners and endcustomers and could cause delays in shipment of our products and adversely affect our results of operations 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our customers outside of the united states which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition a majority of our operating expenses were incurred outside the united states are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the euro and canadian dollar although we have begun to hedge currency exposures relating to certain balance sheet accounts we do not currently hedge currency exposures relating to operating expenses incurred outside of the united states but we may do so in the future if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we generate a majority of revenue from sales to distributors resellers and endcustomers outside of the united states and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations 

we market and sell our products throughout the world and have established sales offices in many parts of the world therefore we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations we are also subject to a number of risks typically associated with international sales and operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 product and service sales may be subject to foreign governmental regulations which vary substantially from country to country further we may be unable to keep uptodate with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time failure to comply with these regulations could result in adverse affects to our business in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or us regulations applicable to us although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies violations of laws or key control policies by our employees contractors channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition financial reporting misstatements fines penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 

certain of our products are subject to us export controls and may be exported outside the us only with the required export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products if we were to fail to comply with us export licensing us customs regulations us economic sanctions and other laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for the company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

furthermore us export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to us embargoed or sanctioned countries governments and persons even though we take precautions to prevent our product from being shipped to us sanctions targets our products could be shipped to those targets by our channel partners despite such precautions any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations and penalties and in reputational harm in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including import permittinglicensing requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or in some cases prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries governments or persons altogether any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition operating results and reputation could be adversely affected 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment the laws and regulations to which we are subject include the european union or eu rohs and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the united states and we are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

the eu rohs and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products we have incurred costs to comply with these laws including research and development costs costs associated with assuring the supply of compliant components and costs associated with writing off noncompliant inventory we expect to incur more of these costs in the future with respect to the eu rohs we and our competitors rely on an exemption for lead in network infrastructure equipment it is possible this exemption will be revoked in the near future if revoked if there are other changes to these laws or their interpretation or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

the eu has also adopted the weee directive which requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection recycling and treatment of such products although currently our eu international channel partners are responsible for the requirements of this directive as the importer of record in most of the european countries in which we sell our products changes in interpretation of the regulations may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements in the future to meet in order to comply with this directive or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions 

our failure to comply with these and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products substantial product inventory writeoffs reputational damage penalties and other sanctions 

  

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

sales to us and foreign federal state and local governmental agency endcustomers have accounted for a portion of our revenue in past periods and we may in the future increase sales to government entities sales into government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a sale government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products most of our sales to government entities have been made indirectly through our distribution channel government entities may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations for example if the distributor receives a significant portion of its revenue from sales to such governmental entity the financial health of the distributor could be substantially harmed which could negatively affect our future sales to such distributor governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our products and services a reduction of revenue or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way finally for purchases by the us government the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the united states and other high cost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet the requirements of the us government 

false detection of viruses or security breaches or false identification of spam or spyware could adversely affect our business 

our antivirus and our intrusion prevention services may falsely detect viruses or other threats that do not actually exist this risk is heightened by the inclusion of a “heuristics” feature in our products which attempts to identify viruses and other threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies that may indicate that a particular item is a threat when our endcustomers enable the heuristics feature in our products the risk of falsely identifying viruses and other threats significantly increases these false positives while typical in the industry may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products also our antispam and antispyware services may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs particularly as spam emails or spyware are often designed to circumvent antispam or spyware products parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or spyware or for interfering with their business in addition false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our products if our system restricts important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted this could adversely affect endcustomers’ systems and cause material system failures any such false identification of important files or applications could result in negative publicity loss of endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

  

if our internal network system is compromised by computer hackers public perception of our products and services will be harmed 

we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective network security protection because we provide network security products we may be a more attractive target for attacks by computer hackers although we have not experienced significant damages from unauthorized access by a thirdparty of our internal network if an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems it could adversely affect the market perception of our products and services in addition such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business including our ability to provide subscription and support services to our endcustomers if this happens our revenue could decline and our business could suffer 

our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and our failure to offer high quality technical support services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

once our products are deployed within our endcustomers’ networks our endcustomers depend on our technical support services as well as the support of our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products if we or our channel partners do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve postdeployment issues and provide effective ongoing support our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers would be adversely affected and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged many enterprise service provider and government entity endcustomers require higher levels of support than smaller endcustomers if we fail to meet the requirements of the larger endcustomers it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with larger endcustomers as a result our failure to maintain high quality support services would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in accounting standards codification asc 74010  formerly referred to as financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb no 109 fin 48  in addition asc 74010 applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

although we released our entire valuation allowance in the year ended december 31 2009 we may in the future be required to establish a new valuation allowance we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 

  

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates 

forecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and tax laws the results of examinations by various tax authorities and the impact of any acquisition business combination or other reorganization or financing transaction to forecast our global tax rate we estimate our pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction and forecast our tax expense by jurisdiction if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimated our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of business financial condition and results of operations 

as a multinational corporation we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region the availability of tax credits and carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations and court rulings consequently taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability andor our effective income tax rate 

in addition we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities if tax authorities challenge the relative mix of us and international income our future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our inability to acquire and integrate other businesses products or technologies could seriously harm our competitive position 

in order to remain competitive we may seek to acquire additional businesses products or technologies and intellectual property such as patents if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business product technology or intellectual property into our existing business and operations we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies intellectual property or products with our existing product lines and maintaining uniform standards controls procedures and policies our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business product or technology including issues with intellectual property product quality or product architecture regulatory compliance practices revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer issues in addition any acquisitions we are able to complete may not be accretive to earnings and may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve which could result in writeoffs that could be substantial for example as discussed further in notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements in the past we have written off certain assets in connection with our purchases of assets from certain companies further completing a potential acquisition and integrating acquired businesses products technologies or intellectual property will significantly divert management time and resources 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released for example one of our highend product models has been experiencing a defect in limited deployments product errors have affected the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our endcustomers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors as a result when problems occur in a network it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems the occurrence of hardware and software errors whether or not caused by our products could delay or reduce market acceptance of our products and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses the occurrence of any such problems could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

although we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims as a result of federal state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake fire or a flood or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a region known for seismic activity in addition natural disasters could affect our manufacturing vendors or logistics providers’ ability to perform services such as manufacturing products on a timely basis and assisting with shipments on a timely basis for example our primary international logistics provider is located in taiwan which is an area known for typhoons in the event our or our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed resulting in missing financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter in addition acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or endcustomers that impacts sales at the end of our quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the delay in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

risks related to our industry 

the network security market is rapidly evolving and the complex technology incorporated in our products makes them difficult to develop if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing endcustomer needs our competitive position and prospects will be harmed 

the network security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly moreover many of our endcustomers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans which require them to add numerous network access points and adapt increasingly complex enterprise networks incorporating a variety of hardware software applications operating systems and networking protocols in addition computer hackers and others who try to attack networks employ increasingly sophisticated techniques to gain access to and attack systems and networks the technology in our products is especially complex because it needs to effectively identify and respond to new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance additionally some of our new products and enhancements may require us to develop new hardware architectures and asics that involve complex expensive and time consuming research and development processes although the market expects rapid introduction of new products or product enhancements to respond to new threats the development of these products is difficult and the timetable for commercial release and availability is uncertain and there can be long time periods between releases and availability of new products we have in the past and may in the future experience unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services and fail to meet previously announced timetables for such availability for example in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we released a new model within our fortigate product line and after its initial release we detected errors in the product that required us to redesign certain aspects of the product which delayed the availability of the product for one quarter and delayed our recognition of revenue from large orders that included such product until the following quarter when the product became available if we do not quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our endcustomers by developing and releasing and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements that can respond adequately to new security threats our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed 

our url database for our web filtering service may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth of urls and may not categorize websites in accordance with our endcustomers’ expectations 

the success of our web filtering service depends on the breadth and accuracy of our url database although our url database currently catalogs millions of unique urls it contains only a portion of the urls for all of the websites that are available on the internet in addition the total number of urls and software applications is growing rapidly and we expect this rapid growth to continue in the future accordingly we must identify and categorize content for our security risk categories at an extremely rapid rate our database and technologies may not be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of websites especially the growing amount of content utilizing foreign languages and the increasing sophistication of malicious code and the delivery mechanisms associated with spyware phishing and 

  

other hazards associated with the internet further the ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments will require us to continually improve the functionality features and reliability of our web filtering function any failure of our databases to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet will impair the market acceptance of our products which in turn will harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our web filtering service may not be successful in accurately categorizing internet and application content to meet our endcustomers’ expectations we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize websites and software applications in our proprietary databases our endcustomers may not agree with our determinations that particular urls should be included or not included in specific categories of our databases in addition it is possible that our filtering processes may place material that is objectionable or that presents a security risk in categories that are generally unrestricted by our users’ internet and computer access policies which could result in such material not being blocked from the network conversely we may miscategorize websites such that access is denied to websites containing information that is important or valuable to our customers any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation any failure to effectively categorize and filter websites according to our endcustomers’ and channel partners’ expectations will impair the growth of our business 

if our new products and product enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance our results of operations and competitive position will suffer 

we spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new products and enhanced versions of our existing products to incorporate additional features improved functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers’ rapidly evolving demands for network security in our highly competitive industry when we develop a new product or an enhanced version of an existing product we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market promote and sell the new offering therefore when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market 

our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market our competitive position will be impaired our revenue will be diminished and the effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research development marketing sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new product or enhancement 

unless we develop better market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow 

we are a relatively new entrant in the network security market and we believe that we have not yet established sufficient market awareness of our participation in that market market awareness of our capabilities and products is essential to our continued growth and our success in all of our markets particularly for the large enterprise service provider and government entities markets if our marketing programs are not successful in creating market awareness of our company and products our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

  

demand for unified threat management products may be limited by market perception that utm products are inferior to network security solutions from multiple vendors 

sales of most of our products depend on increased demand for utm products if the utm market fails to grow as we anticipate our business will be seriously harmed target customers may view utm “allinone” solutions as inferior to security solutions from multiple vendors because of among other things their perception that utm products provide security functions from only a single vendor and do not allow users to choose “bestofbreed” defenses from among the wide range of dedicated security applications available target customers might also perceive that by combining multiple security functions into a single platform utm solutions create a “single point of failure” in their networks which means that an error vulnerability or failure of the utm product may place the entire network at risk in addition the market perception that utm solutions may be suitable only for small and medium sized businesses because utm lacks the performance capabilities and functionality of other solutions may harm our sales to large enterprise service provider and government entity endcustomers if the foregoing concerns and perceptions become prevalent even if there is no factual basis for these concerns and perceptions or if other issues arise with the utm market in general demand for utm products could be severely limited which would limit our growth and harm our business financial condition and results of operations further a successful and publicized targeted attack against us or another well known utm vendor exposing a “single point of failure” could significantly increase these concerns and perceptions and may harm our business and results of operations 

we face intense competition in our market especially from larger betterknown companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

the market for network security products is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future our competitors include networking companies such as cisco systems inc and juniper networks inc security vendors such as check point software technologies ltd mcafee inc and sonicwall inc and other point solution security vendors 

  

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products these larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by endcustomers in these markets and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market also many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security products to the market more quickly than we can some of our smaller competitors are using thirdparty chips designed to accelerate performance conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources in addition current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources such as juniper’s acquisition of netscreen technologies inc mcafee’s acquisition of secure computing corporation and check point’s acquisition of nokia’s security appliance business as a result of such acquisitions our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services initiate or withstand substantial price competition take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do in addition our competitors may bundle products and services competitive with ours with other products and services customers may accept these bundled products and services rather than separately purchasing our products and services due to budget constraints or economic downturns organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing network security infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced revenue and gross margins and loss of market share 

if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network which would have an adverse effect on our business 

large wellestablished providers of networking equipment such as cisco systems inc and juniper networks inc offer and may continue to introduce network security features that compete with our products either in standalone security products or as additional features in their network infrastructure products the inclusion of or the announcement of an intent to include functionality perceived to be similar to that offered by our security solutions in networking products that are already generally accepted as necessary components of network architecture may have an adverse effect on our ability to market and sell our products furthermore even if the functionality offered by network infrastructure providers is more limited than our products a significant number of customers may elect to accept such limited functionality in lieu of adding appliances from an additional vendor such as us many organizations have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to design and operate their networks and have established deep relationships with other providers of networking products which may make them reluctant to add new components to their networks particularly from other vendors such as us in addition an organization’s existing vendors or new vendors with a broad product offering may be able to offer concessions that we are not able to match because we currently offer only network security products and have fewer resources than many of our competitors if organizations are reluctant to add additional network infrastructure from new vendors or otherwise decide to work with their existing vendors our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products without compensating us 

we rely primarily on patent trademark copyright and trade secrets laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology we purchased most of our issued us patents and many of our pending us patent applications from other entities valid patents may not issue from our pending applications and the claims eventually allowed on any patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or products any issued patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under these patents may not actually provide adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages to us patent applications in the united states are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all and publications of discoveries in industryrelated literature lag behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection additionally the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in addition recent changes to the patent laws in the united states may bring into question the validity of certain software patents as a result we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or effectively enforce our issued patents 

despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees consultants vendors and customers and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information however we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology policing unauthorized use of our technology or products is difficult in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the united states from timetotime legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights including aspects of our software and products protected other than by patent rights we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful to date 

  

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses including the gnu public license gpl the gnu lesser public license lgpl the bsd license the apache license and others from timetotime there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services asserting that open source software infringes the claimants’ intellectual property rights we could be subject to suits by parties claiming infringement of intellectual property rights in what we believe to be licensed open source software use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by united states courts and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products in this event we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code to reengineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis any of which could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could harm our business 

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network security industry third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us they may also assert such claims against our endcustomers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur infringement claims may increase any claim of infringement by a thirdparty even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business in addition future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection 

although third parties may offer a license to their technology the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us alternatively we may be required to develop noninfringing technology which could require significant time effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful furthermore a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant’s patents or copyrights royalties or other fees any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we have been involved in patent disputes in the past are currently involved in several patent disputes and likely will be involved in additional disputes in the future in may 2004 trend micro incorporated filed a complaint against us alleging that we infringed a trend micro patent related to antivirus software the international trade commission or itc subsequently instituted an investigation which resulted in an exclusion order and a cease and desist order prohibiting us from selling a broad array of our products in the united states in january 2006 we settled the lawsuit with trend micro and subsequently the itc terminated its action and rescinded the orders pursuant to the settlement and license agreement we initially paid trend micro 150 million the settlement and license agreement provides for additional quarterly royalty payments not expected to exceed 1 of our total revenue each quarter through 2015 in november 2008 we filed a complaint against trend micro in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging among other claims that the patents that are the basis for the ongoing royalty payments are invalid and consequently that we have no contractual obligation to pay the royalties trend micro moved to dismiss the case and in june 2009 the court dismissed the case without prejudice on procedural grounds and we appealed the dismissal in july 2009 based on the dispute we have ceased paying royalties under the settlement and license agreement in august 2009 trend micro filed a complaint against us in the superior court of the state of california for santa clara county alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment that we are obligated to make certain royalty payments to trend micro in december 2009 we withdrew our appeal of the june 2009 dismissal by the united states district court for the northern district of california and filed a new complaint against trend micro in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging among other claims that the patents that are the basis for the ongoing royalty payments are invalid and consequently that we have no contractual obligation to pay the royalties in february 2010 trend micro filed demurrers in the state superior court action regarding fortinet’s affirmative defenses that fortinet has no obligation to pay royalties because the trend micro patents are invalid or unenforceable in march 2010 trend micro filed a motion to dismiss our new complaint that we filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california because this dispute is at an early stage it is not possible to predict the outcome an adverse outcome in this dispute could result in accelerated royalty payments and additional damages 

in january 2009 we filed a complaint against palo alto networks inc in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging among other claims patent infringement on september 4 2009 palo alto networks filed a counterclaim against us alleging patent infringement in may 2009 enhanced security research llc or esr a nonpracticing entity filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging patent infringement by us and other defendants on august 3 2009 esr filed a substantially similar complaint against us in the same court alleging infringement of the same patents the palo alto networks and esr cases are currently at an early stage of the litigation process in september 2009 deep nines inc filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that at least certain of our products infringe certain of their patents deep nines has not yet served us with its complaint and the deadline for service has been extended by the court until march 8 2010 if we are unsuccessful in defending against any of palo alto networks’ esr’s or deep nines’ claims our operating results and financial condition and results may be materially and adversely affected for example we may be required to pay substantial damages and could be prevented from selling certain of our products several other nonpracticing patent holding companies have sent us letters proposing that we license certain of their patents and given this and the proliferation of lawsuits in our industry and other similar industries by both nonpracticing entities and operating entities we expect that we will be sued for patent infringement in the future regardless of the merits of any such lawsuits the cost to defend such lawsuits and any adverse result in such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products or to seek new licenses for existing or new products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 

  

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

as a public company we are subject to compliance initiatives that will require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as other rules implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market impose various requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices we expect these and other similar rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs in addition there are proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration that may further increase compliance costs if established as law if compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management’s attention from other business concerns it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the sarbanesoxley act requires among other things that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly in particular for the fiscal year ending december 31 2010 we must perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we are in the very early stages of the process of evaluating and documenting processes in order to comply with this requirement we may not be able to complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion during the evaluation and testing process if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective we have in the past identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and although we believe we have remediated the material weaknesses certain significant deficiencies remain and we cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses and additional significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would cause the price of our common stock to decline 

if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the risk factors described in this periodic report and other factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us 

furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry fluctuations as well as general economic political and market conditions such as recessions interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 

in the past many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business 

future sales of shares of our common stock by stockholders could depress the price of our common stock 

approximately 52680972 shares of our common stock may be sold by stockholders upon the expiration of lockup agreements in may 2010 this is in addition to stock options that will be vested in may 2010 and eligible for exercise and sale at the expiration of the lockup agreements if stockholders sell or indicate an intent to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the expiration of the lockup and other legal restrictions on resale lapse the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 

  

our failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business 

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months after that we may need to raise additional funds and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the pershare value of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the stockholders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business operating results and financial condition if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms we may not be able to among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 

as of march 1 2010 our executive officers directors and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 414 of our outstanding common stock as a result these stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions this control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 

our certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors our corporate governance documents include provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to provisions of delaware law including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of a substantial majority of all of our outstanding common stock 

any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in january 2009 we filed a complaint against palo alto networks inc in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging among other claims patent infringement on september 4 2009 palo alto networks filed a counterclaim against us alleging patent infringement in may 2009 enhanced security research llc or esr a nonpracticing entity filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging patent infringement by us and other defendants on august 3 2009 esr filed a substantially similar complaint against us in the same court alleging infringement of the same patents the palo alto networks and esr cases are currently at an early stage of the litigation process in september 2009 deep nines inc filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that at least certain of our products infringe certain of their patents deep nines has not yet served us with its complaint and the deadline for service has been extended by the court until march 8 2010

royalty payments are invalid and consequently that we have no contractual obligation to pay the royalties trend micro moved to dismiss the case and in june 2009 the court dismissed the case without prejudice on procedural grounds and we appealed the dismissal in july 2009 based on the dispute we have ceased paying royalties under the settlement and license agreement in august 2009 trend micro filed a complaint against us in the superior court of the state of california for santa clara county alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment that we are obligated to make certain royalty payments to trend micro in december 2009 we withdrew our appeal of the june 2009 dismissal by the united states district court for the northern district of california and filed a new complaint against trend micro in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging among other claims that the patents that are the basis for the ongoing royalty payments are invalid and consequently that we have no contractual obligation to pay the royalties we have continued to accrue expense based on the quarterly royalties provided for in the settlement and license agreement in february 2010 trend micro filed demurrers in the state superior court action regarding fortinet’s affirmative defenses that fortinet has no obligation to pay royalties because the trend micro patents are invalid or unenforceable in march 2010 trend micro filed a motion to dismiss our new complaint that we filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california 

in addition to the above matters we are subject to other litigation in the ordinary course of business the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty if we do not prevail in any of these legal matters our operating results may be materially affected at this time we are unable to estimate the financial impact these actions will likely have on the company

we are a leading provider of network security appliances and the market leader in utm network security solutions we provide broad integrated and high performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the it security infrastructure for enterprises service providers and government entities worldwide as of december 31 2009 we had shipped over 500000 appliances to more than 5000 channel partners and 75000 endcustomers worldwide including a majority of the 2009 fortune global 100 

our core utm product line of fortigate appliances ships with a set of security and networking capabilities including firewall vpn antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering antispam and wan acceleration functionality we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances which range from the fortigate30 designed for small businesses and branch offices to the fortigate5000 series for large enterprises and service providers sales of fortigate products have generally been balanced across entrylevel fortigate30 to 100 series midrange fortigate200 to 800 series and highend fortigate1000 to 5000 series models with each product category representing approximately one third of fortigate sales for each of the last three fiscal years our utm solution also includes our fortiguard security subscription services which endcustomers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to the antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality included in our appliances endcustomers can also choose to purchase forticare technical support services for our products we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise such as messaging webbased traffic and databases and employee computers or handheld devices 

in november 2009 we completed our initial public offering whereby 14375000 shares of common stock were sold to the public at a price of 1250 per share we sold 7656683 shares of our common stock and received 874 million in net proceeds and the selling shareholders sold 6718317 shares of our common stock 

our total revenue increased from 1554 million in fiscal 2007 to 2521 million in fiscal 2009 we achieved profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and have remained profitable each quarter since our total deferred revenue increased by 303 million from 1716 million at december 28 2008 to 2019 at december 31 2009 revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period is a useful metric that management identifies as billings billings drive deferred revenue which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business and has historically represented a majority of the quarterly revenue that we recognize we also ended fiscal 2009 with 2603 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and have had positive cash flow from operations every fiscal year since 2005 

  

our business model 

our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers who in turn sell to our endcustomers in certain cases we sell directly to governmentfocused resellers large service providers and major systems integrators who have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements typically fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our appliances we invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and support services and the invoice generally becomes payable within 30 to 90 days we generally recognize product revenue upfront but defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal subscription and support services contracts and recognize the related services revenue over the service period which is typically one year from the date the endcustomer registers for these services as that is the date on which the services can first be used by the customer as a result our sales of new and renewal services increase our deferred revenue balance which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations services revenue provides a source of recurring revenue for us representing 552 of total revenue for fiscal 2009 and 497 of total revenue for fiscal 2008 and is important to our future revenue and profitability 

we are a global geographically diversified business with more than 60 of our total revenue generated outside of the americas region since fiscal 2006 for fiscal 2009 37 of our total revenue was generated from the americas 38 from emea and 25 from apac we sell globally in us dollars while our international expenses are denominated in local currencies 

  

key metrics 

we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends establish budgets measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies we discuss revenue gross margin and the components of operating income and margin below under “—components of operating results” and we discuss our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments under “—liquidity and capital resources” deferred revenue and cash flow from operations are discussed immediately below the table 

 

  deferred revenue our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from subscription and support service contracts we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods we also assess the increase in our deferred revenue balance plus revenue we recognized in a particular period as a measure of our sales activity for that period 

cash flow from operations we monitor cash flow from operations as a measure of our overall business performance our cash flow from operations is driven in large part by advance payments for both new and renewal contracts for subscription and support services monitoring cash flow from operations enables us to analyze our financial performance without the noncash effects of certain items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expenses thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business our cash flow from operations was 620 million in fiscal 2009 377 million in fiscal 2008 277 million in fiscal 2007 and 34 million in each of fiscal 2006 and 2005 

  

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” we consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap including nongaap gross margin nongaap income from operations and operating margin and nongaap operating expenses these nongaap measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies nongaap gross margin is gross margin as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of noncash stockbased compensation and the noncash asset acquisition related writeoffs described below nongaap income from operations is operating income as reported on our consolidated statements of operations excluding the impact of noncash stockbased compensation and the noncash asset acquisition related writeoffs described below the noncash asset acquisition related writeoffs that we exclude from these nongaap financial measures are expenses for intangible assets that have no future value but these expenses do not include amortization related to the intangible assets that provide an ongoing benefit to our recurring operations nongaap operating margin is defined as nongaap income from operations divided by revenue nongaap operating expenses exclude the impact of noncash stockbased compensation expense 

we believe that these nongaap financial measures are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance as they help illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in these nongaap financial measures furthermore we use many of these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we believe that the expenses that we exclude in these nongaap financial measures are not reflective of these underlying business trends or useful measures for determining our operational performance and overall business strategy by excluding these expenses we believe that our management and investors can better compare our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods 

these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap there are a number of limitations related to the use of these nongaap financial measures versus the nearest gaap equivalent of these financial measures first these nongaap financial measures exclude some costs namely noncash stockbased compensation that are recurring noncash stockbased compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and is an important part of our employees’ compensation that impacts their performance second the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of these nongaap financial measures may differ from the expenses if any that our peer companies may exclude when they report their results of operations we compensate for these limitations by providing the nearest gaap equivalents of these nongaap financial measures and describing these gaap equivalents in our results of operations below 

  

the following tables reconcile gaap gross margin income from operations operating margin and certain operating expenses as reported on our consolidated statements of operations to nongaap gross margin nongaap income from operations nongaap operating margin and certain nongaap operating expenses for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively further presentation of quarterly nongaap gross margin is included in the “quarterly results of operations” section below 

 

   

components of operating results 

revenue 

we derive our revenue from sales of our products and subscription and support services we recognize our revenue in accordance with the guidance in asc 98560525 formerly referred to as statement of position or sop 972 software revenue recognition and sop 989 modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions which is discussed in further detail in “—critical accounting policies and estimates—revenue recognition” below according to asc 98560525 revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 

our total revenue is comprised of the following 

 

  

  

 cost of revenue 

our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 

 

  

  

   

gross profit  gross profit as a percentage of revenue or gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including the average sales price of our products any excess inventory writeoffs manufacturing costs the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services we believe our overall gross margin for the near term may decline modestly or be relatively flat compared to that achieved in fiscal 2009 as we do not anticipate in the near term any significant change in the factors positively influencing gross margin 

services revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue since inception and this trend has had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher services gross margins compared to product gross margins our services gross margins have been increasing but we do not expect these margins to increase substantially in the future as we continue to invest in our support infrastructure 

operating expenses  our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of cashbased personnel costs such as salaries benefits bonuses and with regard to the sales and marketing expense sales commissions they also include noncash stockbased compensation we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees 

 

   

  

 interest income interest income consists of income earned on our cash cash equivalents and investments we have historically invested our cash in moneymarket funds and other shortterm investmentgrade investments 

other income expense net  other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses foreign exchange gains and losses relate to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the associated entity 

provision for benefit from income taxes we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current us income tax 

our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the provision or release of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets state taxes foreign taxes research and development tax credits and nondeductible compensation for periods going forward given we have fully reversed our net deferred tax asset valuation allowance as discussed below we expect that our effective tax rate will approximate the us federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes 

as of december 31 2009 we had 35 million of federal and 334 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income these net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2021 and 2012 for federal and state tax purposes respectively our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset any future taxable income could be subject to limitations attributable to equity transactions that would result in a change of ownership as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the internal revenue code in addition the state of california has suspended the ability of companies to utilize net operating losses to offset 2008 and 2009 state taxable income 

at december 31 2009 we had a total deferred tax asset of approximately 413 million primarily comprised of deferred revenue nondeductible reserves and accruals and net operating loss carryforward during the fourth quarter of 2009 we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets in the future consequently we recognized a 442 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily from the release of substantially all of the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance this reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit totaling 378 million for fiscal 2009 we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement of the periods that the adjustment is determined to be required 

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our forecasted operating plans should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our income tax provision could be materially impacted 

we have 34 million in unrecognized tax benefits which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized our policy is to classify interest accrued or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities our estimates include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation valuation of inventory warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to the financial statements included in this 10k the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition 

we derive revenue from sales of products including appliances and software and services including subscription support and other services our appliances include operating system software that is integrated into the appliance hardware and is deemed essential to its functionality as a result we account for revenue in accordance with asc 985605 and all related interpretations see “—recent accounting pronouncements” for a discussion of new revenue recognition standards that we will be required to adopt by fiscal 2011 we are still assessing the impact of the new standards and have not reflected in this 10k any impact such standards may have on our consolidated financial statements 

no revenue can be recognized until all of the following criteria have been met 

 

  

   

  

 for arrangements which include customer acceptance criteria no revenue is recognized prior to acceptance we recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no rights of return and endcustomers upon shipment of the appliance once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we also make sales through distributors under agreements that allow for rights of return we recognize product revenue on sales made through such distributors upon sale by the distributor to the endcustomer at which time rights of return generally lapse substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with subscription or support services subscription services provide access to our antivirus intrusion prevention web filtering and antispam functionality support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades maintenance releases and patches telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 

we commence our subscription and support services on the date the customer registers the appliance the customer is then entitled to service for the stated contractual period beginning on the registration date 

we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists under the residual method the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue in cases where vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements does not exist typically for subscription and support services revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the performance period of the undelivered elements revenue related to these arrangements is included in ratable product and services revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing for those services when sold separately revenue for professional services and training is recognized upon completion of the related services 

we offer certain sales incentives to channel partners additionally in limited circumstances we may permit endcustomers distributors and resellers to return our products subject to varying limitations for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances we estimate and record reserves for these sales incentives and sales returns based on our historical experience in each accounting period we must make judgments and estimates of sales incentives and potential future sales returns related to current period revenue these estimates affect our net revenue line item on our consolidated statement of operations and affect our net accounts receivable deferred revenue or accrued liabilities line items on our consolidated balance sheet historically there have been no significant adjustments to these estimates related to prior periods 

at december 31 2009 our allowance for sales returns was 50 million compared to 27 million at december 28 2008 if our allowance for sales returns was to increase by 10 or 05 million our net revenue would decrease by 05 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

stockbased compensation 

our stockbased compensation expense is as follows 

 employees prior to january 2 2006 we accounted for stockbased awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with asc 718 formerly referred to as accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 44 effective january 2 2006 we adopted asc 718 sfas 123r for stock option grants made subsequent to january 2 2006 we have accounted for such stockbased awards to employees in accordance with asc 718 sfas 123r which requires compensation expense related to sharebased transactions including employee stock options to be measured and recognized in the financial statements based on a determination of the fair value of the stock options the grant date fair value is determined using the blackscholesmerton “blackscholes” pricing model 

  

we adopted asc 718 sfas 123r using the prospective method in which nonpublic entities that previously applied asc 718 sfas 123r using the minimum value method whether for financial statement recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes would continue to account for unvested stock options outstanding at the date of adoption of asc 718 sfas 123r in the same manner as they had been accounted for prior to the adoption of asc 718 sfas 123r we will continue to apply asc 718 apb 25 in future periods to stock options issued and outstanding at january 2 2006 

for all employee stock options we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straightline method 

there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stockbased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon exercise stock options may expire or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 

as of the end of fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 there was approximately 175 million 136 million and 41 million respectively of unrecognized stockbased compensation expense related to nonvested stock option awards net of estimated forfeitures that we expect to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 261 277 and 147 years respectively 

  

for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 we calculated the fair value of options granted to employees using the blackscholes pricing model with the following assumptions 

 

  

 nonemployees during the years ended december 31 2009 and december 28 2008 we issued to nonemployees in exchange for services options to purchase 13000 and 29000 shares of common stock respectively at a range of exercise prices from 747 to 1100 per share no options were granted to nonemployees in exchange for services during the year ended december 30 2007 these options vest over periods of up to 48 months and in accordance with asc 50550 formerly referred to as emerging issues task force eitf issue no 9618  we accounted for these options as variable awards the options were valued using the blackscholes option pricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions 

 

 valuation of inventory 

inventory is recorded at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand the timing of new product introductions economic trends and market conditions if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted we could be required to record additional inventory writedowns which would be charged to cost of product revenue any writedowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability during fiscal 2007 we wroteoff 63 million of excess inventory of which 60 million was writtenoff in the second half of fiscal 2007 

warranty liabilities 

we generally provide a oneyear warranty on hardware products and a 90day warranty on software a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is charged to cost of product revenue based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our gross margin could be adversely affected 

accounting for income taxes 

we record income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns in estimating future tax consequences generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 

we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities we provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 

on january 1 2007 we adopted asc 74010 fin 48 which defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements asc 74010 requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets which are included in our consolidated balance sheets in general deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 

in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible during the fourth quarter of 2009 we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the future we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets as a result we released all of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 

we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted 

  

results of operations 

the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods 

 

  

    

 fiscal years 2009 and 2008 

revenue 

 

 total revenue increased 403 million or 190 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to growth in services revenue the americas and emea regions contributed the largest portion of this growth product revenue increased 41 million or 43 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase in product revenue was primarily driven by higher product sales volume predominantly in the americas region as we expanded our distributor base to include those that focus on high volume sales of entrylevel products while there were no material price changes between the periods the shift in product mix towards our entrylevel products had the effect of decreasing our average sales price services revenue increased 339 million or 322 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base the increase in services revenue also reflects additional services revenue amortization of approximately 16 million due to our reporting period transition discussed above the growth in ratable product and services revenue was due to a slight decrease in the weightedaverage service period over which such revenue was recognized due to a decrease in the average contractual term of support contracts for arrangements in which we recognized product and services revenue ratably over the performance period 

  

cost of revenue and gross margin 

 

 total gross margin increased 31 percentage points in fiscal 2009 primarily due to improved product and service margins and a higher mix of services revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 product gross margin increased 11 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower warrantyrelated return costs which resulted in a savings of 32 million partially offset by 24 million of asset acquisition related writeoffs the 25 percentage point increase in services gross margin was primarily due to growth in services revenue resulting from a larger customer base to leverage our support cost structure services cost increased by 28 million primarily due to 20 million of higher cashbased personnel costs related to headcount increases in our professional services and training teams and an increase of 03 million in stockbased compensation ratable product and services gross margin was unchanged in the period 

operating expenses 

 

 research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 52 million or 139 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase of 37 million in cashbased personnel costs as a result of increased headcount to support continued enhancements of our products we also had an increase of 09 million in stockbased compensation expense an increase of 02 million in depreciation expense and 02 million in supplies and other expenses 

sales and marketing expense 

sales and marketing expense increased 86 million or 98 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased cashbased personnel costs of 54 million based on increased headcount primarily in the us a 13 million increase in promotional and other marketingrelated expenses a 05 million increase in rent and occupancyrelated expenses a 04 million increase in travel higher depreciation costs of 04 million and a 05 million increase in stockbased compensation expense as a percentage of revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased 32 percentage points 

general and administrative expense 

in fiscal 2009 general and administrative expense increased 17 million or 101 compared to fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily due to a 09 million increase in external legal services a 05 million increase in accountingrelated services a 05 million increase in rent and occupancyrelated expenses and a 04 million increase in stockbased compensation these increases were partially offset by a 05 million decrease in computer related supplies and a 02 million decrease in travel expenses 

  

interest income and other income expense net 

 

 the 06 million decrease in interest income in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was due to lower interest rates earned despite higher balances of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the change in other income expense net for fiscal 2009 was the result of a stronger us dollar compared to the euro british pound and the canadian dollar in 2008 when compared to 2009 

  

provision for income taxes 

 

  

 the effective tax rate was negative 1187 for fiscal 2009 compared with an effective tax rate of 204 for fiscal 2008 the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2009 is comprised primarily of federal state and foreign income taxes as well as the release of the valuation allowance the decrease in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was attributable to the release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets we generated pretax income in fiscal 2009 and 2008 as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected future taxable income we reversed approximately 442 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance having determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized this reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit totaling 378 million our estimates of future taxable income represent critical accounting estimates because such estimates are subject to change and a downward adjustment could have a significant impact on future earnings furthermore we continue to evaluate our net deferred tax asset position in regards to the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 

fiscal years 2008 and 2007 

revenue 

 

 total revenue increased 564 million or 363 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of growth in sales in the emea and americas regions product revenue increased 245 million or 349 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 largely driven by increased sales of our higherend products consisting of our fortigate1000 to 5000 series to large enterprises and service providers while there were no material price changes between the periods the shift in product mix towards our higherend products had the effect of increasing our average sales price in addition we experienced modest overall growth in sales volume services revenue increased 311 million or 420 due to an increase in our installed customer base the modest growth in ratable product and services revenue was due to the incremental amortization of new ratable product and services sales 

  

cost of revenue and gross margin 

 

 total gross margin increased 56 percentage points in fiscal 2008 primarily due to improving product margins based on enhanced inventory management and a higher mix of services revenue the 75 percentage point increase in product gross margin in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a 63 million excess inventory writeoff taken in fiscal 2007 which reduced product gross margin by approximately 90 percentage points in fiscal 2007 the 30 percentage point increase in services gross margin in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to higher revenue and a larger customer base which enabled us to leverage our support cost structure services cost increased 35 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase of 25 million in cashbased personnel costs resulting from increased headcount in our threat research centers and in our technical support centers in both the emea and americas regions additional costs included a 04 million increase in stockbased compensation expense and 05 million of higher facilityrelated expenses to support the additional staffing requirements ratable gross margin increased in accordance with the respective product and services gross margin increases 

operating expenses 

 

 the increase in stockbased compensation expense in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the remeasurement of the vested portion of certain option grants associated with extending the exercise period for employees that had terminated their employment with us see “—critical accounting policies and estimates—stockbased compensation” 

research and development expense 

research and development expense increased 94 million or 342 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase of 81 million in cashbased personnel costs as a result of increased headcount an increase of 07 million in higher external test and certification costs and an increase of 07 million for rent and occupancyrelated expenses these increases were partially offset by a 04 million decrease in stockbased compensation expense 

sales and marketing expense 

sales and marketing expense increased 156 million or 216 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased cashbased personnel costs of 122 million resulting from increased headcount in an effort to help drive our overall revenue growth in fiscal 2008 we also had 25 million in additional promotional and other marketingrelated expenses 13 million of incremental rent and occupancyrelated expenses and 05 million from increased travel expenses these increases were partially offset by a 14 million decrease in stockbased compensation expense as a result sales and marketing expense as a percent of revenue decreased 50 percentage points in fiscal 2008 

  

general and administrative expense 

the 39 million decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to 36 million in lower external accounting and legal services expenses in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 when we made investments in the automation of our financial processes cashbased personnel costs increased 12 million as we incurred the full year costs from increased headcount in fiscal 2007 to support our growth and bad debt expense of 02 million offset by a decrease in stockbased compensation expense of 17 million as a result general and administrative expense as a percent of revenue decreased 53 percentage points in fiscal 2008

 the 09 million decrease in interest income in fiscal 2008 was due to lower interest rates earned despite higher balances of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the gain in fiscal 2008 in other income expense net was the result of an increase in foreign exchange gains primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro british pound and the canadian dollar the loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the same three currencies 

provision for income taxes 

 

  

 the effective tax rate was 204 for fiscal 2008 compared with an effective tax rate of negative 89 for fiscal 2007 the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2008 is comprised primarily of foreign income taxes and state taxes we incurred tax expense despite a consolidated loss before income taxes for fiscal 2007 primarily due to foreign income taxes paid based on profits realized by our foreign subsidiaries the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was attributable to an increase in state income taxes due to improved results in fiscal 2008 offset by a reduction in foreign income tax expense driven by the realization of certain foreign tax credits 

quarterly results of operations 

the following table set forth unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight fiscal quarters the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period 

  

  

   

seasonality cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends 

our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products subscriptions and services in general a pattern of increased customer buying at yearend has positively impacted sales activity in the fourth quarter which can make it difficult to achieve sequential growth in the first quarter our product revenue in the third quarter has also been negatively affected by reduced economic activity in the summer months particularly in europe similarly our gross margins and operating income have been affected by these historical trends because expenses are relatively fixed in the nearterm although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance on a quarterly basis we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of a quarter we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 

our total quarterly revenue has increased sequentially during seven of the last eight quarters although a significant volume of shipments occurs towards the end of each of our quarterly reporting periods including during the quarter ended december 31 2009 management believes that the transition from a fiscal quarter ending on the sunday closest to the calendar quarter end to a calendar quarter end basis which transition added three days to the quarter ended september 30 2009 did not materially impact our product revenue as we manage our quarter end sales cycle based on our financial reporting period end we believe the declines in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and in europe in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 are based on seasonality as discussed above product revenue in each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 was essentially flat compared to the same periods in fiscal 2008 which we believe was due in part to adverse global economic conditions additionally product revenue was lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 due to a delay in the availability of a new product which delayed revenue recognition on orders until the second quarter of fiscal 2009 services revenue has generally increased sequentially each quarter as new support and subscription contracts have been entered into and existing customers have renewed their contracts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 product revenue increased 12 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increased product sales in all three regions and in particular increased sales to enterprise and service provider customers services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased by 25 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 due to recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance as our subscription and support services were sold to a larger customer base in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we also benefited from an additional day of amortization of approximately 04 million due to the change in our reporting period discussed above 

 

   

quarterly gross margin trend 

gross margin has fluctuated on a quarterly basis primarily due to shifts in the mix of sales between products and services types of products sold and the average selling prices of our products product gross margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased due to higher discounts and a 05 million writeoff for excess and obsolete inventory that we incurred in that period product gross margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 also decreased due to asset acquisition related costs of 17 million services gross margins have increased or remained relatively flat from the first quarter of fiscal 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal 2009 due to higher revenue and a larger customer base over which to spread related costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 services gross margin decreased due to an increase in headcount as we continue to invest in support personnel 

 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 prior to our initial public offering in november 2009 we had financed our operations primarily through private sales of equity securities and more recently cash generated from operations in november 2009 we completed our initial public offering and raised net proceeds of 874 million at december 31 2009 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 2603 million were held for workingcapital purposes and were invested primarily in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities and us government debt securities we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts the expansion of sales and marketing activities the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate fluctuation risk 

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper money market funds government and corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio a 10 decrease in interest rates in 2009 2008 and 2007 would have resulted in a decrease in our interest income of approximately 02 million 03 million and 04 million respectively as of december 31 2009 our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were in money market funds commercial paper corporate debt securities and us government debt securities 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the us are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates particularly changes in the canadian dollar and euro additionally fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations we recognized other income expense net of 02 million in fiscal 2009 due to foreign currency transaction gains 

  

we recently began to use foreign exchange forward contracts to partially mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain balance sheet accounts we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes these contracts typically have maturities between one and two months and we record gains and losses from these instruments in other income expense net 

inflation risk 

our monetary assets consisting primarily of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are not affected significantly by inflation because they are shortterm we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations the rate of inflation however affects our cost of revenue and expenses such as those for employee compensation which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us
